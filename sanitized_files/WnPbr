fleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if
the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shouts
were heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was
napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and in
its small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimes
russians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tell
he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it
occasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently at
but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where
he was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of his
generals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselves in
which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers
alternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or maddened
even at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what was
taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry
fire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantry
and now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not knowing what
to do with one another screamed and ran back again
from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his
marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of
the action but all these reports were false both because it was
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others and also
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon
circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings that
borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in the
hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the
troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
on the farther side and wait but before that order was given almost as
soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodino the bridge had been
retaken by the russians and burned in the very skirmish at which pierre
had been present at the beginning of the battle
an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face
and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campan
wounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had been
told that the french had been repulsed the fleches had in fact been
recaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and only
slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
reports napoleon gave his orders which had either been executed before
he gave them or could not be and were not executed
the marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle but
like napoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and only
occasionally went within musket range made their own arrangements
without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run but even
their orders like napoleons were seldom carried out and then but
partially for the most part things happened contrary to their orders
soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiers
ordered to remain where they were suddenly seeing russians
unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward
and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russians
in this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semenovsk hollow
and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
galloped full speed back again the infantry moved in the same way
sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
go to all orders as to where and when to move the guns when to send
infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantry all
such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units
concerned without asking either ney davout or murat much less
napoleon they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
orders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is at
stake is what is dearest to man his own life and it sometimes seems
that safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward and
these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to
the mood of the moment in reality however all these movements forward
and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops all
their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm of
disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
the fields on which these men were floundering about as soon as they
left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about their
superiors located in the background re formed them and brought them
under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
back to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of death
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
napoleons generals davout ney and murat who were near that region
of fire and sometimes even entered it repeatedly led into it huge
masses of well ordered troops but contrary to what had always happened
in their former battles instead of the news they expected of the
enemys flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and
terrified mobs the generals re formed them but their numbers
constantly decreased in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant
napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when murats
adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed
if his majesty would let him have another division
reinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking at
the adjutant a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like murats
own as though he did not understand his words
reinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they need
reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
tell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not noon yet
and i dont yet see my chessboard clearly go
the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began
talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle
in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest
napoleon berthiers eyes turned to look at a general with a suite who
was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was belliard
having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a
loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the
napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
you are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up to
the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go
and have another look and then come back to me
before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of the
now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man
asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture
the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but the
emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back and
we must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart who
do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he
subsequently termed that gosling i have made an eagle
send claparedes division sire replied berthier who knew all the
the adjutant galloped to claparedes division and a few minutes later
the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon
no he suddenly said to berthier i cant send claparede send
though there was no advantage in sending friants division instead of
claparedes and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
claparede and sending friant now the order was carried out exactly
napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the
part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines a role he so justly
friants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of
the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked
for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their
positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was
napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought
m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning
came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his
i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he
napoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation to
refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset ventured
with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside
a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de
beaussets face and he glided away to the other generals
napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever
lucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and always
winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
game finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
his troops were the same his generals the same the same preparations
had been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courte
et energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew that
he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the
enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedland yet the terrible
stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent
all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the
concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break
the enemys line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all these
methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory
but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded of
reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the
russians and of disorganization among his own troops
formerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few
phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the
corps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon and
stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena
austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening
despite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this was
not the same not at all the same as what had happened in his former
battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and
they all shunned one anothers eyes only a de beausset could fail to
but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a
battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all
efforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and that
the least accident might now with the fight balanced on such a strained
when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in
which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannon
or army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at the
concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
russians still holding their ground a terrible feeling like a nightmare
took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
him occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wing
might break through his center he himself might be killed by a stray
cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only
considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky
chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was like
a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him
and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
should annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french
army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool
below the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier
approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me my
amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through
which napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly
or in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before
seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar of
guns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave a
peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux
vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk and through the
smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they
the russians stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and its
knoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth
clouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continuous
slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the
russians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
from which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going on
before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
depend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first
one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
the old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleon
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senseless
napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time
at eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guard
destroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevardino
on the rug covered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat
kutuzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave no
orders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested
yes yes do that he replied to various proposals yes yes go
dear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of those
about him or no dont wed better wait he listened to the reports
that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded
that of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were
not interested in the import of the words spoken but rather in
something else in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
were reporting by long years of military experience he knew and with
the wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man to
direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and he
knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
commander in chief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor by
the number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible force
called the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided it
in as far as that was in his power
kutuzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention
and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master
the fatigue of his old and feeble body
at eleven oclock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the
french had been retaken but that prince bagration was wounded kutuzov
ride over to prince peter ivanovich and find out about it exactly he
said to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of wurttemberg
will your highness please take command of the first army
soon after the dukes departure before he could possibly have reached
semenovsk his adjutant came back from him and told kutuzov that the
kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over the
command of the first army and a request to the duke whom he said he
could not spare at such an important moment to return to him when they
brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the staff
wait a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there is
nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better to
but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army
when scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
french had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk kutuzov
guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbinins looks that the
news was bad rose as if to stretch his legs and taking scherbinins
go my dear fellow he said to ermolov and see whether something
kutuzov was in gorki near the center of the russian position the
attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several
times repulsed in the center the french had not got beyond borodino
and on their left flank uvarovs cavalry had put the french to flight
toward three oclock the french attacks ceased on the faces of all who
came from the field of battle and of those who stood around him
kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with
the days success a success exceeding his expectations but the old
mans strength was failing him several times his head dropped low as if
it were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought him
adjutant general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrew
had said the war should be extended widely and whom bagration so
detested rode up while kutuzov was at dinner wolzogen had come from
barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank
the sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men running
back and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances
concluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to the
kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced
at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids
wolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutuzov with a
half contemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of his
he treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
intended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it to
russians to make an idol of this useless old man but that he knew whom
he was dealing with der alte herr as in their own set the germans
called kutuzov is making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen
and looking severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he began to
report to the old gentleman the position of affairs on the left flank
as barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
all the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we cannot
dislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and it is
kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen as if
not understanding what was said to him wolzogen noticing the old
i have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness
what i have seen the troops are in complete disorder
you have seen you have seen kutuzov shouted frowning and rising
how how dare you he shouted choking and making a threatening
gesture with his trembling arms how dare you sir say that to me you
know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that his information
is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
me the commander in chief than to him
wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but kutuzov interrupted him
the enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
flank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say what
you dont know be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform him
of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutuzov
all were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
they are repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave army
the enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
soil of russia said kutuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbed
wolzogen shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips stepped silently
aside marveling at the old gentlemans conceited stupidity
ah here he is my hero said kutuzov to a portly handsome dark
haired general who was just ascending the knoll
this was raevski who had spent the whole day at the most important part
raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
that the french no longer ventured to attack
then you do not think like some others that we must retreat
on the contrary your highness in indecisive actions it is always the
most stubborn who remain victors replied raevski and in my
kaysarov kutuzov called to his adjutant sit down and write out the
order of the day for tomorrow and you he continued addressing
another ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack
while kutuzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the day
wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to
have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given
kutuzov without looking at wolzogen gave directions for the order to
be written out which the former commander in chief to avoid personal
and by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
throughout an army one and the same temper known as the spirit of the
army and which constitutes the sinew of war kutuzovs words his
order for a battle next day immediately became known from one end of
it was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
farthest links of that chain the tales passing from mouth to mouth at
different ends of the army did not even resemble what kutuzov had said
but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was
not the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay in
the commander in chiefs soul as in that of every russian
and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearing
from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe
the exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspirited
prince andrews regiment was among the reserves which till after one
oclock were stationed inactive behind semenovsk under heavy artillery
fire toward two oclock the regiment having already lost more than two
hundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap
between semenovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perished
that day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundred
enemy guns was directed between one and two oclock
without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here
lost another third of its men from in front and especially from the
right in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysterious
domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissing
cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly at times as if
to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed during which the
cannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes several men
were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
being dragged away and the wounded carried off
with each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
yet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundred
paces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in the
ranks and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot
and the cry of stretchers was heard most of the time by their
officers order the men sat on the ground one having taken off his
shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight
again another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished his
bayonet another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his
bandolier while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his
boots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
ground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemed
fully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded when
rows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great
masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke no one paid any
attention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or
some of our infantry were seen to move forward words of approval were
heard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by
occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was
as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday
commonplace occurrences a battery of artillery was passing in front of
the regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace
hey look at the trace horse get her leg out shell fall ah
they dont see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
regiment another time general attention was attracted by a small brown
dog coming heaven knows whence which trotted in a preoccupied manner
in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
close by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs and darted
aside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment but
such distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men had
been inactive without food in constant fear of death and their pale
and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier
prince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced up
and down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of the
meadow beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his back
there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everything
went on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the wounded
carried away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the rear
they returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew
considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them
an example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convinced
that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach
them all the powers of his soul as of every soldier there were
unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
situation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling the
grass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took big
strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
mowers then he counted his steps calculating how often he must walk
from one strip to another to walk a mile then he stripped the flowers
from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut rubbed them in his
palms and smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent nothing remained
of the previous days thoughts he thought of nothing he listened with
weary ears to the ever recurring sounds distinguishing the whistle of
flying projectiles from the booming of the reports glanced at the
tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion and waited
here it comes this one is coming our way again he thought
listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke one
another again it has hit he stopped and looked at the ranks no
it has gone over but this one has hit and again he started trying to
reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces a whizz and a thud five
paces from him a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared a
chill ran down his back again he glanced at the ranks probably many
had been hit a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion
adjutant he shouted order them not to crowd together
the adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrew
from the other side a battalion commander rode up
look out came a frightened cry from a soldier and like a bird
whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shell dropped
with little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to the
battalion commanders horse the horse first regardless of whether it
was right or wrong to show fear snorted reared almost throwing the
major and galloped aside the horses terror infected the men
lie down cried the adjutant throwing himself flat on the ground
prince andrew hesitated the smoking shell spun like a top between him
and the prostrate adjutant near a wormwood plant between the field and
can this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new
envious glance at the grass the wormwood and the streamlet of smoke
that curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not wish to
die i love life i love this grass this earth this air he
thought this and at the same time remembered that people were looking
its shameful sir he said to the adjutant what
he did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the sound of
an explosion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame a
suffocating smell of powder and prince andrew started to one side
raising his arm and fell on his chest several officers ran up to him
from the right side of his abdomen blood was welling out making a large
the militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
officers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass
the peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs but he
moaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again
pick him up lift him its all the same cried someone
they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher
ah god my god what is it the stomach that means death my god
it flew a hairs breadth past my ear said the adjutant
the peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders started
hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing station
keep in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing by
their shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and
get into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasant
now thats right said the one behind joyfully when he had got into
your excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timokhin who
had run up and was looking down on the stretcher
prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
the militiamen carried prince andrew to the dressing station by the
wood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted of
three tents with flaps turned back pitched at the edge of a birch wood
in the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were eating
oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the
grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees
cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres
bloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the wounded
stood crowds of soldier stretcher bearers with dismal and attentive
faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the
spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning
against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend
the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the
tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally
dressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to be
brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
groaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some were
delirious prince andrews bearers stepping over the wounded who had
not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to
one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew
opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on
around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the
whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two
steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
attracting general attention stood a tall handsome black haired
noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in the
head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk a
crowd of wounded and stretcher bearers was gathered
we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbed
the king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glittered
with fever if only reserves had come up just then lads there
wouldnt have been nothing left of him i tell you surely
like all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with
shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but isnt it all the
same now thought he and what will be there and what has there been
here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in
this life i did not and do not understand
one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holding
a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
bloodstained hands so as not to smear it he raised his head and looked
about him but above the level of the wounded men he evidently wanted a
little respite after turning his head from right to left for some time
all right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed prince
andrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tent
murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting
it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a
prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
cleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could not
make out distinctly what was in that tent the pitiful groans from all
sides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distracted
him all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked
bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent as
a few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies had filled
the dirty pond beside the smolensk road yes it was the same flesh the
same chair a canon the sight of which had even then filled him with
there were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied and on
the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was left
alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two
tables on the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging by
the uniform thrown down beside him four soldiers were holding him and
a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back
ooh ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthy
snub nosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth he
began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing and
prolonged yells on the other table round which many people were
crowding a tall well fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back
his curly hair its color and the shape of his head seemed strangely
familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chest
to hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all the
time with a feverish tremor the man was sobbing and choking
convulsively two doctors one of whom was pale and trembling were
silently doing something to this mans other gory leg when he had
finished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat the
spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping his hands
he glanced at prince andrews face and quickly turned away
undress him what are you waiting for he cried angrily to the
his very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to prince
andrews mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent down
over the wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign to
someone and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to
lose consciousness when he came to himself the splintered portions of
his thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away and the wound
bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as prince
andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the
after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a
blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all the
best and happiest moments of his life especially his earliest
childhood when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaning
over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in the
pillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of life returned to his
memory not merely as something past but as something present
the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up and
show it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans could
be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs
hearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he was
dying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life or
because of those memories of a childhood that could not return or
because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
was groaning so piteously he felt like weeping childlike kindly and
the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
oh oh ooh he sobbed like a woman
the doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrew
my god what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself
in the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just been
amputated he recognized anatole kuragin men were supporting him in
their arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollen
lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully yes it is
he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me
thought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him
what is the connection of that man with my childhood and life he
asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected
memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
him he remembered natasha as he had seen her for the first time at the
ball in 1810 with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy
face ready for rapture and love and tenderness for her stronger and
more vivid than ever awoke in his soul he now remembered the
connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly
gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered
everything and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy
prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving
tears for his fellow men for himself and for his own and their errors
compassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for those
who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached on
earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understand that
is what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me
had i lived but now it is too late i know it
the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and the
consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced an
unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the
killed and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength of
mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that
strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
greatness he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
shevardino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollen
and heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarse
involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing
with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which he
regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a
personal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in his own
person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the
heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of
suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire
moscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory the
one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when he
had been on the semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovo
napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
to him of the effect those batteries produced
an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had
been concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that they
our fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said the
they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice
sire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark
they want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it
even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and for
which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him
was being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
greatness and again as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
something for itself he submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomy
and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of
his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the
significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
truth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able to
grasp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded as they
were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness and
not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
killed and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as he
looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and
deceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone did
he write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superb
because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of st
helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his
leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrote
the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times
it was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and
security of all it was purely pacific and conservative
it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the
beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out
full of well being and prosperity for all the european system was
already founded all that remained was to organize it
satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere i too
should have had my congress and my holy alliance those ideas were
stolen from me in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
discussed our interests like one family and have rendered account to
europe would in this way soon have been in fact but one people and
anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the
common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom of all navigable
rivers for everybody that the seas should be common to all and that
the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards
on returning to france to the bosom of the great strong magnificent
peaceful and glorious fatherland i should have proclaimed her
frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all
aggrandizement antinational i should have associated my son in the
empire my dictatorship would have been finished and his constitutional
paris would have been the capital of the world and the french the envy
my leisure then and my old age would have been devoted in company
with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son to
leisurely visiting with our own horses and like a true country couple
every corner of the empire receiving complaints redressing wrongs and
scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
napoleon predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner
of the peoples assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
peoples welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
of four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula he wrote further of
the russian war half were austrians prussians saxons poles
neapolitans the imperial army strictly speaking was one third
composed of dutch belgians men from the borders of the rhine
piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans romans inhabitants of the
thirty second military division of bremen of hamburg and so on it
included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french the
russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand men
the russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in the various
battles four times more men than the french army the burning of moscow
cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and want
in the woods finally in its march from moscow to the oder the russian
army also suffered from the severity of the season so that by the time
it reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand and at kalisch less
he imagined that the war with russia came about by his will and the
horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul he boldly took the whole
responsibility for what happened and his darkened mind found
justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians
several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydov
family and to the crown serfs those fields and meadows where for
hundreds of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino and
semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at the
dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
of some three acres around crowds of men of various arms wounded and
unwounded with frightened faces dragged themselves back to mozhaysk
from the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowds
exhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others held
over the whole field previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of
bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun there now spread a
mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood
clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded
on the frightened exhausted and hesitating men as if to say enough
men enough cease bethink yourselves what are you doing
to the men of both sides alike worn out by want of food and rest it
began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
slaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the
question arose in every soul for what for whom must i kill and be
killed you may go and kill whom you please but i dont want to do
so anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul at any
moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were
doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere
but though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of
what they were doing though they would have been glad to leave off
some incomprehensible mysterious power continued to control them and
they still brought up the charges loaded aimed and applied the match
though only one artilleryman survived out of every three and though
they stumbled and panted with fatigue perspiring and stained with blood
and powder the cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
sides crushing human bodies and that terrible work which was not done
by the will of a man but at the will of him who governs men and worlds
