him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head he advanced
nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who
is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping
what a fierce old fellow muttered the students the rumor spread
through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old
regicide the mob had turned in through the rue de la verrerie
little gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of
je nai quun dieu quun roi quun liard et quune botte
je nai quun dieu quun roi quun liard et quune botte
je nai quun dieu quun roi quun liard et quune botte
je nai quun dieu quun roi quun liard et quune botte46
the band augmented every moment near the rue des billettes a man of
lofty stature whose hair was turning gray and whose bold and daring
mien was remarked by courfeyrac enjolras and combeferre but whom
none of them knew joined them gavroche who was occupied in singing
whistling humming running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the
shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol paid no attention to this
it chanced that in the rue de la verrerie they passed in front of
this happens just right said courfeyrac i have forgotten my purse
he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed he seized
he also seized a large square coffer of the dimensions of a large
valise which was concealed under his soiled linen
as he descended again at a run the portress hailed him
why you know perfectly well im the concierge my name is mother
well if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again i shall call you
mother de veuvain now speak whats the matter what do you want
there is some one who wants to speak with you
but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the
at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckled and youthful
artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed
velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of
a man emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which
was not the least in the world like a womans voice
the young man gazed steadily at him and said
would you like to have me carry your coffer for you
would you like to have me go with you
if you like replied courfeyrac the street is free the pavements
and he made his escape at a run to join his friends when he had
rejoined them he gave the coffer to one of them to carry it was only
a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had
a mob does not go precisely where it intends we have explained that
a gust of wind carries it away they overshot saint merry and found
themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue saint denis
chapter i history of corinthe from its foundation
the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue rambuteau at the end
near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue mondetour a
basket makers shop having for its sign a basket in the form of napoleon
have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed
it was there that lay the rue de la chanvrerie which ancient deeds
spell chanverrerie and the celebrated public house called corinthe
the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade
effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade
saint merry it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la
chanvrerie now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about to
may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital
to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of
waterloo persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact
manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the
pointe saint eustache at the northeast angle of the halles of paris
where to day lies the embouchure of the rue rambuteau have only to
imagine an n touching the rue saint denis with its summit and the halles
with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la
grande truanderie and the rue de la chanvrerie and whose transverse
bar should be formed by the rue de la petite truanderie the old rue
mondetour cut the three strokes of the n at the most crooked angles
so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to
form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue
saint denis on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue
des precheurs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of
varying sizes placed crosswise and hap hazard and barely separated
like the blocks of stone in a dock by narrow crannies
we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark
contracted many angled alleys lined with eight story buildings these
buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chanvrerie and the rue
de la petite truanderie the fronts were shored up with beams running
from one house to another the street was narrow and the gutter broad
the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet skirting
little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops
excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous century old
gratings the rue rambuteau has devastated all that
the name of mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that
whole set of streets a little further on they are found still better
expressed by the rue pirouette which ran into the rue mondetour
the passer by who got entangled from the rue saint denis in the rue de
la chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had
entered an elongated funnel at the end of this street which was very
short he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles
by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind
alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through
which he could make his escape this was the rue mondetour which on
one side ran into the rue de precheurs and on the other into the rue
du cygne and the petite truanderie at the bottom of this sort of
cul de sac at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be
seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a sort
of cape in the street it is in this house of two stories only that
an illustrious wine shop had been merrily installed three hundred years
before this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old
the situation was good and tavern keepers succeeded each other there
in the time of mathurin regnier this cabaret was called the
pot aux roses and as the rebus was then in fashion it had for its
sign board a post poteau painted rose color in the last century the
worthy natoire one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the
stiff school having got drunk many times in this wine shop at the
very table where regnier had drunk his fill had painted by way of
gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes on the pink post the keeper of the
cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed
in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth
grapes au raisin de corinthe hence the name of corinthe nothing
is more natural to drunken men than ellipses the ellipsis is the
zig zag of the phrase corinthe gradually dethroned the pot aux roses
the last proprietor of the dynasty father hucheloup no longer
acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue
a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first
floor containing a billiard table a wooden spiral staircase piercing
the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad
daylight this was the style of this cabaret a staircase with a
trap door in the lower room led to the cellar on the second floor were
the lodgings of the hucheloup family they were reached by a staircase
which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance
only a private door in the large room on the first floor under the
roof in two mansard attics were the nests for the servants the
kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap room
father hucheloup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is
that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone
in his wine shop they also ate there hucheloup had invented a capital
thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps
which he called carpes au gras these were eaten by the light of a
tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of louis xvi on tables to which
were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table cloths people came thither
from a distance hucheloup one fine morning had seen fit to notify
passers by of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a pot of black
paint and as he was an orthographer on his own account as well as
a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on his wall this
one winter the rain storms and the showers had taken a fancy to
obliterate the s which terminated the first word and the g which began
time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become
in this way it came about that though he knew no french father
hucheloup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his
kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled
horace and the striking thing about it was that that also meant
nothing of all this is in existence now the mondetour labyrinth was
disembowelled and widely opened in 1847 and probably no longer exists
at the present moment the rue de la chanvrerie and corinthe have
disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue rambuteau
as we have already said corinthe was the meeting place if not the
rallying point of courfeyrac and his friends it was grantaire who had
discovered corinthe he had entered it on account of the carpe horas
and had returned thither on account of the carpes au gras there they
drank there they ate there they shouted they did not pay much they
paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome
hucheloup that amiable man as was just said was a wine shop keeper
with a mustache an amusing variety he always had an ill tempered air
seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who
entered his establishment and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel
with them than of serving them with soup and yet we insist upon
the word people were always welcome there this oddity had attracted
customers to his shop and brought him young men who said to each
other come hear father hucheloup growl he had been a fencing master
all of a sudden he would burst out laughing a big voice a good
fellow he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked
nothing better than to frighten you very much like those snuff boxes
which are in the shape of a pistol the detonation makes one sneeze
mother hucheloup his wife was a bearded and a very homely creature
about 1830 father hucheloup died with him disappeared the secret of
stuffed carps his inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine shop
but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had
always been bad became fearfully bad nevertheless courfeyrac and his
friends continued to go to corinthe out of pity as bossuet said
the widow hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic
recollections she deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation
she had a way of her own of saying things which spiced her
reminiscences of the village and of her springtime it had formerly been
her delight so she affirmed to hear the loups de gorge rouges gorges
chanter dans les ogrepines aubepines to hear the redbreasts sing in
the hall on the first floor where the restaurant was situated was
a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and
tables and with a crippled lame old billiard table it was reached
by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a
square hole like the hatchway of a ship
this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was
always burning had the air of a garret all the four footed furniture
comported itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls
had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mame
elle etonne a dix pas elle epouvente a deux
on tremble a chaque instant quelle ne vous la mouche
et quun beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche48
this was scrawled in charcoal on the wall
mame hucheloup a good likeness went and came from morning till
night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity two
serving maids named matelote and gibelotte49 and who had never been
known by any other names helped mame hucheloup to set on the tables
the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the
hungry patrons in earthenware bowls matelote large plump redhaired
and noisy the favorite ex sultana of the defunct hucheloup was
homelier than any mythological monster be it what it may still as it
becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was
less homely than mame hucheloup gibelotte tall delicate white with a
lymphatic pallor with circles round her eyes and drooping lids always
languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude
the first up in the house and the last in bed waited on every one even
the other maid silently and gently smiling through her fatigue with a
before entering the restaurant room the visitor read on the door the
following line written there in chalk by courfeyrac
regale si tu peux et mange si tu loses50
laigle de meaux as the reader knows lived more with joly than
elsewhere he had a lodging as a bird has one on a branch the
two friends lived together ate together slept together they had
everything in common even musichetta to some extent they were what
the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bini on the
morning of the 5th of june they went to corinthe to breakfast joly
who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which laigle was beginning to
share laigles coat was threadbare but joly was well dressed
it was about nine oclock in the morning when they opened the door of
the wine shop was empty there was no one there but themselves
gibelotte knowing joly and laigle set a bottle of wine on the table
while they were busy with their first oysters a head appeared at the
hatchway of the staircase and a voice said
i am passing by i smell from the street a delicious odor of brie
grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table
at the sight of grantaire gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the
are you going to drink those two bottles laigle inquired of
all are ingenious thou alone art ingenuous two bottles never yet
the others had begun by eating grantaire began by drinking half a
so you have a hole in your stomach began laigle again
you have one in your elbow said grantaire
and after having emptied his glass he added
ah by the way laigle of the funeral oration your coat is old
i should hope so retorted laigle thats why we get on well
together my coat and i it has acquired all my folds it does not bind
me anywhere it is moulded on my deformities it falls in with all my
movements i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm old coats
thats true ejaculated joly striking into the dialogue an old goat
especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said
grantaire demanded laigle have you just come from the boulevard
we have just seen the head of the procession pass joly and i
how quiet this street is exclaimed laigle who would suspect that
paris was turned upside down how plainly it is to be seen that in
former days there were nothing but convents here in this neighborhood
du breul and sauval give a list of them and so does the abbe lebeuf
they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted
shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minims capuchins
carmelites little augustines great augustines old augustines there
dont lets talk of monks interrupted grantaire it makes one want
bouh ive just swallowed a bad oyster now hypochondria is taking
possession of me again the oysters are spoiled the servants are ugly
i hate the human race i just passed through the rue richelieu in front
of the big public library that pile of oyster shells which is called
a library is disgusting even to think of what paper what ink what
scrawling and all that has been written what rascal was it who said
that man was a featherless biped51 and then i met a pretty girl of
my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called
floreal and who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels
because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with
small pox deigned to take a fancy to her alas woman keeps on the
watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well
as birds two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she
adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet holes of corsets what do
you call it she sewed she had a camp bed she dwelt beside a pot
of flowers she was contented now here she is a bankeress this
transformation took place last night i met the victim this morning in
high spirits the hideous point about it is that the jade is as pretty
to day as she was yesterday her financier did not show in her face
roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women that the traces
left upon them by caterpillars are visible ah there is no morality on
earth i call to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel
the symbol of air the olive that ninny the symbol of peace the
apple tree which came nearest rangling adam with its pips and the
fig tree the grandfather of petticoats as for right do you know what
right is the gauls covet clusium rome protects clusium and demands
what wrong clusium has done to them brennus answers the wrong that
alba did to you the wrong that fidenae did to you the wrong that the
eques the volsci and the sabines have done to you they were your
neighbors the clusians are ours we understand neighborliness just as
you do you have stolen alba we shall take clusium rome said you
shall not take clusium brennus took rome then he cried vae victis
that is what right is ah what beasts of prey there are in this world
he held out his glass to joly who filled it then he drank and went on
having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one
brennus who takes rome is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette
is an eagle there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other
so we believe in nothing there is but one reality drink whatever your
opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or
in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glaris it matters little
drink you talk to me of the boulevard of that procession et caetera
et caetera come now is there going to be another revolution this
poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me he has to keep
greasing the groove of events every moment there is a hitch it wont
work quick a revolution the good god has his hands perpetually black
with that cart grease if i were in his place id be perfectly simple
about it i would not wind up my mechanism every minute id lead the
human race in a straightforward way id weave matters mesh by mesh
without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements
i would have no extraordinary repertory what the rest of you call
progress advances by means of two motors men and events but sad to
say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary the ordinary
troupe suffices neither for event nor for men among men geniuses are
required among events revolutions great accidents are the law the
order of things cannot do without them and judging from the apparition
of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors
needed for its performance at the moment when one expects it the least
god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament some queer star
turns up underlined by an enormous tail and that causes the death
of caesar brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god a blow with a
comet crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold
a great man 93 in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of 1811
at the head of the poster ah what a beautiful blue theatre all studded
with unexpected flashes boum boum extraordinary show raise your
eyes boobies everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama
good god it is too much and not enough these resources gathered from
exception seem magnificence and poverty my friends providence has
come down to expedients what does a revolution prove that god is in a
quandry he effects a coup detat because he god has not been able to
make both ends meet in fact this confirms me in my conjectures as
to jehovahs fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on
earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a
hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is
very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness
the prince de conde hung when i see winter which is nothing but a rent
in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many rags even
in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when
i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the frost that
paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so
many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so
much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich the appearance
exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up he gives a revolution
as a tradesman whose money box is empty gives a ball god must not be
judged from appearances beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive
a poverty stricken universe creation is bankrupt that is why i am
discontented here it is the 4th of june it is almost night ever since
this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come
and i bet that it wont come all day this is the inexactness of an
ill paid clerk yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything
else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition
everything goes awry the universe is a tease its like children those
who want them have none and those who dont want them have them total
im vexed besides laigle de meaux that bald head offends my sight
it humiliates me to think that i am of the same age as that baldy
however i criticise but i do not insult the universe is what it is
i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience receive
eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration ah
by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not
intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a
shuttlecock between two battledores from the group of the loungers to
the group of the roysterers i was made to be a turk watching oriental
houris all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as
sensuous as the dream of a chaste man or a beauceron peasant or a
venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewomen or a petty german prince
furnishing the half of a foot soldier to the germanic confederation and
occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to
say his frontier those are the positions for which i was born yes i
have said a turk and i will not retract i do not understand how people
can habitually take turks in bad part mohammed had his good points
respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with
odalisques let us not insult mohammedanism the only religion which is
ornamented with a hen roost now i insist on a drink the earth is a
great piece of stupidity and it appears that they are going to fight
all those imbeciles and to break each others profiles and to massacre
each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might
go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of
new mown hay in the meadows really people do commit altogether
too many follies an old broken lantern which i have just seen at a
bric a brac merchants suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to
enlighten the human race yes behold me sad again thats what comes
of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way i am growing
melancholy once more oh frightful old world people strive turn each
other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it
and grantaire after this fit of eloquence had a fit of coughing which
a propos of revolution said joly it is decidedly abberent that
does any one know with whom demanded laigle
marius love affairs exclaimed grantaire i can imagine it marius
is a fog and he must have found a vapor marius is of the race of
poets he who says poet says fool madman tymbraeus apollo marius and
his marie or his marion or his maria or his mariette they must make
a queer pair of lovers i know just what it is like ecstasies in which
they forget to kiss pure on earth but joined in heaven they are souls
possessed of senses they lie among the stars
grantaire was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second
harangue when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the
stairs it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small
yellow with an odd phiz a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair
drenched with rain and wearing a contented air
the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed
that is my nickname replied laigle what do you want with me
this a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me do you know
mother hucheloup i said yes rue chanvrerie the old mans widow
he said to me go there there you will find m bossuet tell him from
me a b c its a joke that theyre playing on you isnt it he gave
joly lend me ten sous said laigle and turning to grantaire
this made twenty sous which laigle handed to the lad
i cant i belong in the procession im the one to shout down with
and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the
most respectful of all possible salutes he took his departure
that is the pure bred gamin there are a great many varieties of the
gamin species the notarys gamin is called skip the gutter the cooks
gamin is called a scullion the bakers gamin is called a mitron
the lackeys gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the
cabin boy the soldiers gamin is called the drummer boy the painters
gamin is called paint grinder the tradesmans gamin is called an
errand boy the courtesan gamin is called the minion the kingly gamin
is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino
in the meantime laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud
a b c that is to say the burial of lamarque
the tall blonde remarked grantaire is enjolras who is sending you
its raiding said joly i have sworn to go through fire but not
through water i dont wand to ged a gold
i shall stay here said grantaire i prefer a breakfast to a hearse
conclusion we remain said laigle well then let us drink
besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot
ah the riot i am with you cried joly
now were going to touch up the revolution of 1830 as a matter of
fact it does hurt the people along the seams
i dont think much of your revolution said grantaire i dont
execrate this government it is the crown tempered by the cotton
night cap it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella in fact i think
that to day with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his
royalty in two directions he might extend the tip of the sceptre end
against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven
the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of
daylight there was no one in the wine shop or in the street every one
is it mid day or midnight cried bossuet you cant see your hand
enjolras disdains me he muttered enjolras said joly is ill
grantaire is drunk it was to bossuet that he sent navet if he had
come for me i would have followed him so much the worse for enjolras
this resolution once arrived at bossuet joly and grantaire did not
stir from the wine shop by two oclock in the afternoon the table at
which they sat was covered with empty bottles two candles were burning
on it one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the
other in the neck of a cracked carafe grantaire had seduced joly and
bossuet to wine bossuet and joly had conducted grantaire back towards
as for grantaire he had got beyond wine that merely moderate
inspirer of dreams ever since mid day wine enjoys only a conventional
popularity with serious drinkers there is in fact in the matter
of inebriety white magic and black magic wine is only white magic
grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams the blackness of a terrible
fit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted
him he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass the
beer glass is the abyss having neither opium nor hashish on hand and
being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse
to that fearful mixture of brandy stout absinthe which produces the
most terrible of lethargies it is of these three vapors beer brandy
and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed they are three
grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed
there in a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat
three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the
grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it he was
tremendously gay and bossuet and joly retorted they clinked glasses
grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas
a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with
dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated
astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn
let the doors of the palace be thrown open let every one be a member
of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame hucheloup
woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate
matelote and gibelotte dodt gib grantaire anything more to drink
he has already devoured since this bording in wild prodigality two
who has been unhooking the stars without my permission and putting
them on the table in the guise of candles
he was seated on the sill of the open window wetting his back in the
falling rain and gazing at his two friends
all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of
to arms he turned round and saw in the rue saint denis at the end
of the rue de la chanvrerie enjolras passing gun in hand and gavroche
with his pistol feuilly with his sword courfeyrac with his sword and
jean prouvaire with his blunderbuss combeferre with his gun bahorel
with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following
the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long bossuet
improvised a speaking trumpet from his two hands placed around his
courfeyrac heard the shout caught sight of bossuet and advanced a few
paces into the rue de la chanvrerie shouting what do you want which
well here this is a good place make it here
and at a signal from courfeyrac the mob flung themselves into the rue
chapter iii night begins to descend upon grantaire
the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street
widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket
without exit corinthe created an obstacle the rue mondetour was easily
barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except
from the rue saint denis that is to say in front and in full sight
bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal
terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob there
was not a passer by who did not get out of sight in the space of a
flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables
area doors windows blinds attic skylights shutters of every
description were closed from the ground floor to the roof a terrified
old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes poles
for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry the
wine shop alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the
mob had rushed into it ah my god ah my god sighed mame hucheloup
joly who had placed himself at the window exclaimed
courfeyrac you ought to have brought an umbrella you will gatch
in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had
been wrenched from the grated front of the wine shop ten fathoms of
street had been unpaved gavroche and bahorel had seized in its passage
and overturned the dray of a lime dealer named anceau this dray
contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the piles
of paving stones enjolras raised the cellar trap and all the widow
hucheloups empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime feuilly
with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had
backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of
rough stone blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured
no one knows where the beams which served as props were torn from
the neighboring house fronts and laid on the casks when bossuet and
courfeyrac turned round half the street was already barred with
a rampart higher than a man there is nothing like the hand of the
populace for building everything that is built by demolishing
matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers gibelotte went and
came loaded with rubbish her lassitude helped on the barricade she
served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air
an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street
bossuet strode over the paving stones ran to it stopped the driver
made the passengers alight offered his hand to the ladies dismissed
the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the
omnibuses said he do not pass the corinthe non licet omnibus adire
an instant later the horses were unharnessed and went off at their
will through the rue mondetour and the omnibus lying on its side
mame hucheloup quite upset had taken refuge in the first story
her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried
in a low tone her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her
the end of the world has come she muttered
joly deposited a kiss on mame hucheloups fat red wrinkled neck and
said to grantaire my dear fellow i have always regarded a womans
but grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb matelote
had mounted to the first floor once more grantaire seized her round her
waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window
matelote is homely he cried matelote is of a dream of ugliness
