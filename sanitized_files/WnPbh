countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had
followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined
polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the
emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance
boris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for the
present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an
aide de camp had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris was
now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a
long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the
favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently
married they met as good friends of long standing
at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable
partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were the
third couple boris coolly looking at helenes dazzling bare shoulders
which emerged from a dark gold embroidered gauze gown talked to her
of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and
unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor
who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the
doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
as the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one of
those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary
to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady
having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at
balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady
and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of
amazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashev by the arm
and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards
wide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticed
arakcheevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev
arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with
his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor
to address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was
displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor
but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden
without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing
wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them
all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he was
worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he
could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose
two ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess
potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over
the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev
and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were
moving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time to
withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head
the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally
to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as
a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that it
gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with
the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that
let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown
boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes
slightly bowed his head the emperor re entered the ballroom and
boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had
crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain
important personages that much that was concealed from others was
usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their
the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was
particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at
a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation
and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully
expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home
at two oclock that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told
him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal
prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on
next day the following letter was sent to napoleon
yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept my
engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian
frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in
which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that
your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on
which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was
never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of
it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your
troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not
having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the
contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an
attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your
majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am
at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having
sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to
take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching
balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told
him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them
in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt
it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to
having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a
bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the
village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he
a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did
not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking
the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse
advanced his horses chest against balashev put his hand to his saber
and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he
did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the
noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after
conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general
being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev
found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile
and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to
the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was
fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after
balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked
silently at one another from time to time
a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came
riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by
two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked
it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of
martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign
the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and
evidently understood balashevs importance he led him past his soldiers
and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperors
they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar
horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the
village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his
the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure
they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group
of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse
with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in
his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red
mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man
rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and
gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine
balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the
bracelets plumes necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping
toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the
french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in
fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite
incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and
was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more
solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really
was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that
city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians
called out to him viva il re  he turned to his wife with a pensive
smile and said poor fellows they dont know that i am leaving them
but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied
the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had
been ordered to return to military service and especially since his
last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august brother in law
had told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not
in yours he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business and like
a well fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
skittish between the shafts he dressed up in clothes as variegated and
expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither
on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair
curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked
inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his
majesty of balashevs mission whose name he could not pronounce
de bal macheve said the king overcoming by his assurance the
difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make
your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly
as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his
natural tone of good natured familiarity he laid his hand on the
well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance
your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not
desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words
your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in
frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty
murats face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur
de bal macheve but royaute oblige  and he felt it incumbent on him
as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with alexanders
envoy he dismounted took balashevs arm and moving a few steps away
from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down
with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that
the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known
and the dignity of france was thereby offended
balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand
then you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked
balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the
oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i
wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war
begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in
the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his
health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity
murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood
at his coronation and waving his right arm said
i wont detain you longer general i wish success to your mission
and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his
glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
balashev rode on supposing from murats words that he would very soon
be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next
village the sentinels of davouts infantry corps detained him as the
pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps
commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal
davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a
coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to
express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty
in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are
necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always
appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their
proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone
can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a grenadiers mustache
with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face
danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to
maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was
balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasants hut
writing he was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found
him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put
themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a
hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i
am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of
his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men
when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own
dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when
balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when
the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at
balashevs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by
his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still
when he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression this
reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor
alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform
him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after
where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to
balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
your emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout
and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his
dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
balashev took out the packet containing the emperors letter and laid it
on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid
across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription
you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not
protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to
davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashevs face
you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in
a minute later the marshals adjutant de castres came in and conducted
that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels
next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to
him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the
baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one
after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence
and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with
the marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the whole
district balashev was brought to vilna now occupied by the french
through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously
next day the imperial gentleman in waiting the comte de turenne came
to balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor him
four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in
front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french
grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a
brilliant suite of aides de camp pages and generals who were waiting
for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle
horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very
house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission
though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury
the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
generals gentlemen in waiting and polish magnates several of whom
balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting
duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going
after some minutes the gentleman in waiting who was on duty came into
the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow
balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a
study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on
his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried
footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all
was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps
firm and resolute they were those of napoleon he had just finished
dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a
white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white
leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and
hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one
lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck
stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled
of eau de cologne his full face rather young looking with its
prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that
imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in
comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that
he nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming up
to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his
time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure
he will always say the right thing and say it well
good day general said he i have received the letter you brought
from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with
his large eyes into balashavs face and immediately looked past him
it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at all
evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him
nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything
in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will
i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been
forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive
and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly
moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev
was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the
russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before
sire the emperor my master but the sight of the emperors eyes
bent on him confused him you are flurried compose yourself napoleon
seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor
alexander did not consider kurakins demand for his passports a
sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative
and without his sovereigns assent that the emperor alexander did not
desire war and had no relations with england
not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his
feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might
after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the
emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into
negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he
remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his
letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had
told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words
so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some
complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he
wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the
napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these last
words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a
louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that
followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily
noticed the quivering of napoleons left leg which increased the more
i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i
not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have
waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin
negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an
energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand
the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev
the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond
the niemen only the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at
instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania
only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned
you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen
before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago
the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder
he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was
quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was
conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me
such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a
prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his
own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept
such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his
army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i
have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when
your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the
aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued
hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and
the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking
and the more he talked the less could he control his words
the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
insult alexander just what he had least desired at the commencement of
i hear you have made peace with turkey
but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the
talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone
yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining
moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those
provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would
have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he
wont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to
his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the
gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could
not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he
paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words
he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have
owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several
times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to
what a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have been
he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried
what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through
my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in
perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my
enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and
wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country
armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french
subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all
the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders mind
granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued
napoleon hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his
perception the two were one and the same but they are not even that
they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most
capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first
movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes
armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act
does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result
bagration alone is a military man hes stupid but he has experience a
quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch
playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him
the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with
the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering
these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander
the campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been able to
defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish
on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember
what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i
know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have
not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give
you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor
could carry no weight i give you my word of honor that i have five
hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will
be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
peace with you as for the swedes it is their fate to be governed by
mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for another
bernadotte who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with
napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose
balashev knew how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would have
done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity
of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side
sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation
to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is
in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared
to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man
he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon
had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking
at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have allies
the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions
and there will be two hundred thousand of them
and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in
the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round
drew close to balashevs face and gesticulating rapidly and
know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the map
of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he
struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will
throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will re
erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe
to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is
what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several
times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching
he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted
it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he
paused looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said in a
and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had
balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the
russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was
silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from
the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know its
your duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i have
when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed
at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door
opened a gentleman in waiting bending respectfully handed the emperor
his hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon
without giving them a glance turned to balashev
assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i
am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly
esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you
and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room
after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the
last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you
shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would
not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with him an
insulted envoy especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but
to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine
bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner
napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign
of constraint or self reproach on account of his outburst that morning
but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he
had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he
the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where
crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the
windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his
monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved
at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated
him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers
one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his
success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and
questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an
interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if
convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his
how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true
that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in
and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches
but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for
balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor
every country has its own character said he
but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon
i beg your majestys pardon returned balashev besides russia there
is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries
this reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of the
french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanders
court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where it
the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
were puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested if there is a point
we dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to
say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not
notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the
direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert
all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome
so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the
road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily
flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he
uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the
badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg
after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which four
days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat
down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a
napoleon was in that well known after dinner mood which more than any
reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by
men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner
balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a
they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange
isnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark
would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his napoleons
balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence
yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were
deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and self
confident smile what i cant understand he went on is that the
emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that
i do not understand has he not thought that i may do the same and
he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him
back on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh in
and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing
his cup away with his hand ill drive all his wurttemberg baden and
weimar relations out of germany yes ill drive them out let him
balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help
hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression
he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now
fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masters
and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is
the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and
not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a
again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down
the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to
balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as
if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
balashev he raised his hand to the forty year old russian generals
face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips
to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the french court
well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you say
anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the
adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses
ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head
in reply to balashevs bow let him have mine he has a long way to
the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander
every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch
after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to
petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet
anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching
petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the
city pierre had warned his brother in law that prince andrew was on his
track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the
minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in
petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who was
always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should
accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been
appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an
appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey
prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he
thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin
personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again
failed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived
the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions
prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken
faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became
trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so
highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the
thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the
field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which
had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome
but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons
they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical
matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more
eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if
that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in
which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious
of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the
simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs staff he
applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised
kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found
kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might
be before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite all
the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
to a conflict with him he knew that when he did meet him he would not
be able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help
snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet
avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and
poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and
in the year 1812 when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharest
where kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days and
nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer
him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of bolkonskis
activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let him
go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly
before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at
drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way
being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three
years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt
and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that
on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find
the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he
entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the
avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted
sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the
same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture
the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only
somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden
getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the
same coquettish self satisfied girl enjoying every moment of her
existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become
more self confident prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had
brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking
broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly
intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had
changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a
noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as
ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was
happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown
become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite
unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as
the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of
immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally
all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had
changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was
divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for
his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the
old prince mademoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other
princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and
during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they
were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he
was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening
when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell
him of the young count kamenskys campaign the old prince began
unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her
superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said
was the only person really attached to him
the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess
mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by
indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the
old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this
say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an
old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance
and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he doesnt understand so i
must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and
he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughters
if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was
censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to
speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if
there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i cant
blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since
you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritable as he was
always liable to do of late i can only say that if there are any
misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not
the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile
disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could
what companion my dear boy eh youve already been talking it over
father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and
bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall
say that mary is not to blame but those to blame the one to blame is
ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a
low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment
but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a
prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him
to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not
leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and
tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day
before leaving prince andrew went to his sons rooms the boy curly
headed like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and
prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a
reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty
child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in
himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at
leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and
was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he
