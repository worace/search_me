anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning the
duc de nevers was in his eyes the great figure of the century what a
charming grand seigneur he said and what a fine air he had with his
in the eyes of m gillenormand catherine the second had made reparation
for the crime of the partition of poland by purchasing for three
thousand roubles the secret of the elixir of gold from bestucheff he
grew animated on this subject the elixir of gold he exclaimed the
yellow dye of bestucheff general lamottes drops in the eighteenth
century this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love the
panacea against venus at one louis the half ounce phial louis xv
sent two hundred phials of it to the pope he would have been greatly
irritated and thrown off his balance had any one told him that the
elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron m gillenormand
adored the bourbons and had a horror of 1789 he was forever narrating
in what manner he had saved himself during the terror and how he had
been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to
escape having his head cut off if any young man ventured to pronounce
an eulogium on the republic in his presence he turned purple and grew
so angry that he was on the point of swooning he sometimes alluded to
his ninety years and said i hope that i shall not see ninety three
twice on these occasions he hinted to people that he meant to live to
he had theories here is one of them when a man is passionately fond
of women and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little
who is homely cross legitimate with plenty of rights perched on the
code and jealous at need there is but one way of extricating himself
from the quandry and of procuring peace and that is to let his wife
control the purse strings this abdication sets him free then his
wife busies herself grows passionately fond of handling coin gets her
fingers covered with verdigris in the process undertakes the education
of half share tenants and the training of farmers convokes lawyers
presides over notaries harangues scriveners visits limbs of the law
follows lawsuits draws up leases dictates contracts feels herself the
sovereign sells buys regulates promises and compromises binds fast
and annuls yields concedes and retrocedes arranges disarranges
hoards lavishes she commits follies a supreme and personal delight
and that consoles her while her husband disdains her she has the
satisfaction of ruining her husband this theory m gillenormand had
himself applied and it had become his history his wife the second
one had administered his fortune in such a manner that one fine day
when m gillenormand found himself a widower there remained to him just
sufficient to live on by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity
of fifteen thousand francs three quarters of which would expire with
him he had not hesitated on this point not being anxious to leave
a property behind him besides he had noticed that patrimonies are
subject to adventures and for instance become national property he
had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents and he
had no great faith in the great book of the public debt all thats
the rue quincampois he said his house in the rue filles du clavaire
belonged to him as we have already stated he had two servants a male
and a female when a servant entered his establishment m gillenormand
re baptized him he bestowed on the men the name of their province
nimois comtois poitevin picard his last valet was a big foundered
short winded fellow of fifty five who was incapable of running twenty
paces but as he had been born at bayonne m gillenormand called him
basque all the female servants in his house were called nicolette even
the magnon of whom we shall hear more farther on one day a haughty
cook a cordon bleu of the lofty race of porters presented herself
how much wages do you want a month asked m gillenormand thirty
francs what is your name olympie you shall have fifty francs
chapter vi in which magnon and her two children are seen
with m gillenormand sorrow was converted into wrath he was furious at
being in despair he had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts
of liberties one of the facts of which his exterior relief and his
internal satisfaction was composed was as we have just hinted that he
had remained a brisk spark and that he passed energetically for such
this he called having royal renown this royal renown sometimes drew
down upon him singular windfalls one day there was brought to him in
a basket as though it had been a basket of oysters a stout newly
born boy who was yelling like the deuce and duly wrapped in
swaddling clothes which a servant maid dismissed six months
previously attributed to him m gillenormand had at that time
fully completed his eighty fourth year indignation and uproar in the
establishment and whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to
believe that what audacity what an abominable calumny m gillenormand
himself was not at all enraged he gazed at the brat with the amiable
smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny and said in an
aside well what now whats the matter you are finely taken aback
and really you are excessively ignorant m le duc dangouleme the
bastard of his majesty charles ix married a silly jade of fifteen
when he was eighty five m virginal marquis dalluye brother to
the cardinal de sourdis archbishop of bordeaux had at the age of
eighty three by the maid of madame la presidente jacquin a son a
real child of love who became a chevalier of malta and a counsellor of
state one of the great men of this century the abbe tabaraud is the
son of a man of eighty seven there is nothing out of the ordinary in
these things and then the bible upon that i declare that this little
gentleman is none of mine let him be taken care of it is not his
fault this manner of procedure was good tempered the woman whose
name was magnon sent him another parcel in the following year it was a
boy again thereupon m gillenormand capitulated he sent the two brats
back to their mother promising to pay eighty francs a month for their
maintenance on the condition that the said mother would not do so any
more he added i insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well
i shall go to see them from time to time and this he did he had had
a brother who was a priest and who had been rector of the academy of
poitiers for three and thirty years and had died at seventy nine
i lost him young said he this brother of whom but little memory
remains was a peaceable miser who being a priest thought himself
bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met but he never gave them
anything except bad or demonetized sous thereby discovering a means of
going to hell by way of paradise as for m gillenormand the elder he
never haggled over his alms giving but gave gladly and nobly he was
kindly abrupt charitable and if he had been rich his turn of mind
would have been magnificent he desired that all which concerned him
should be done in a grand manner even his rogueries one day having
been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance in a gross
and apparent manner he uttered this solemn exclamation that was
indecently done i am really ashamed of this pilfering everything has
degenerated in this century even the rascals morbleu this is not the
way to rob a man of my standing i am robbed as though in a forest but
badly robbed silva sint consule dignae he had had two wives as
we have already mentioned by the first he had had a daughter who had
remained unmarried and by the second another daughter who had died
at about the age of thirty who had wedded through love or chance
or otherwise a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the
republic and of the empire who had won the cross at austerlitz and had
been made colonel at waterloo he is the disgrace of my family
said the old bourgeois he took an immense amount of snuff and had a
particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the
back of one hand he believed very little in god
chapter vii rule receive no one except in the evening
such was m luc esprit gillenormand who had not lost his hair which
was gray rather than white and which was always dressed in dogs
ears to sum up he was venerable in spite of all this
he had something of the eighteenth century about him frivolous and
in 1814 and during the early years of the restoration m gillenormand
who was still young he was only seventy four lived in the faubourg
saint germain rue servandoni near saint sulpice he had only retired
to the marais when he quitted society long after attaining the age of
and on abandoning society he had immured himself in his habits the
principal one and that which was invariable was to keep his door
absolutely closed during the day and never to receive any one whatever
except in the evening he dined at five oclock and after that his door
was open that had been the fashion of his century and he would not
swerve from it the day is vulgar said he and deserves only a
closed shutter fashionable people only light up their minds when the
zenith lights up its stars and he barricaded himself against every
one even had it been the king himself this was the antiquated elegance
chapter viii two do not make a pair
we have just spoken of m gillenormands two daughters they had come
into the world ten years apart in their youth they had borne very
little resemblance to each other either in character or countenance
and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible the
youngest had a charming soul which turned towards all that belongs to
the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which
fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was
wedded from her very youth in ideal to a vague and heroic figure the
elder had also her chimera she espied in the azure some very wealthy
purveyor a contractor a splendidly stupid husband a million made man
or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the
antechamber with a chain on his neck official balls the harangues
of the town hall to be madame la prefete all this had created a
whirlwind in her imagination thus the two sisters strayed each in her
own dream at the epoch when they were young girls both had wings the
one like an angel the other like a goose
no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least no paradise
becomes terrestrial in our day the younger wedded the man of her
dreams but she died the elder did not marry at all
at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are
relating she was an antique virtue an incombustible prude with one of
the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible
to see a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family no one
had ever known her first name she was called mademoiselle gillenormand
in the matter of cant mademoiselle gillenormand could have given points
to a miss her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness
she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld
age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty her guimpe was
never sufficiently opaque and never ascended sufficiently high she
multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking
the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in
proportion as the fortress is the less menaced
nevertheless let him who can explain these antique mysteries of
innocence she allowed an officer of the lancers her grand nephew
in spite of this favored lancer the label prude under which we
have classed her suited her to absolute perfection mademoiselle
gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul prudery is a demi virtue and a
to prudery she added bigotry a well assorted lining she belonged
to the society of the virgin wore a white veil on certain festivals
mumbled special orisons revered the holy blood venerated the sacred
heart remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo jesuit altar
in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful
and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble and
she had a chapel friend an ancient virgin like herself named
mademoiselle vaubois who was a positive blockhead and beside whom
mademoiselle gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle beyond
the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of
anything except of the different ways of making preserves mademoiselle
vaubois perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a
let us say it plainly mademoiselle gillenormand had gained rather than
lost as she grew older this is the case with passive natures she had
never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear
away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to
her she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not
herself know the secret there breathed from her whole person the stupor
of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning
she kept house for her father m gillenormand had his daughter near
him as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him
these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not
rare and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on
there was also in this house between this elderly spinster and this
old man a child a little boy who was always trembling and mute in the
presence of m gillenormand m gillenormand never addressed this child
except in a severe voice and sometimes with uplifted cane here sir
rascal scoundrel come here answer me you scamp just let me see
you you good for nothing etc etc he idolized him
this was his grandson we shall meet with this child again later on
when m gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni he had frequented
many very good and very aristocratic salons although a bourgeois m
gillenormand was received in society as he had a double measure of wit
in the first place that which was born with him and secondly that
which was attributed to him he was even sought out and made much of he
never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there
there are people who will have influence at any price and who will have
other people busy themselves over them when they cannot be oracles
they turn wags m gillenormand was not of this nature his domination
in the royalist salons which he frequented cost his self respect
nothing he was an oracle everywhere it had happened to him to hold his
own against m de bonald and even against m bengy puy vallee
about 1817 he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in
his own neighborhood in the rue ferou with madame la baronne de t
a worthy and respectable person whose husband had been ambassador of
france to berlin under louis xvi baron de t who during his lifetime
had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions had died
bankrupt during the emigration leaving as his entire fortune
some very curious memoirs about mesmer and his tub in ten manuscript
volumes bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges madame de t had
not published the memoirs out of pride and maintained herself on a
meagre income which had survived no one knew how
madame de t lived far from the court a very mixed society as she
said in a noble isolation proud and poor a few friends assembled
twice a week about her widowed hearth and these constituted a purely
royalist salon they sipped tea there and uttered groans or cries of
horror at the century the charter the bonapartists the prostitution
of the blue ribbon or the jacobinism of louis xviii according as the
wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs and they spoke in low tones of
the hopes which were presented by monsieur afterwards charles x
the songs of the fishwomen in which napoleon was called nicolas were
received there with transports of joy duchesses the most delicate and
charming women in the world went into ecstasies over couplets like the
there they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible
with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous with
quatrains with distiches even thus upon the dessolles ministry a
moderate cabinet of which mm decazes and deserre were members
pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base21
il faut changer de sol et de serre et de case
or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers an abominably jacobin
chamber and from this list they combined alliances of names in such
a manner as to form for example phrases like the following damas
sabran gouvion saint cyr all this was done merrily in that society
they parodied the revolution they used i know not what desires to give
point to the same wrath in inverse sense they sang their little ca
songs are like the guillotine they chop away indifferently to day this
head to morrow that it is only a variation
in the fualdes affair which belongs to this epoch 1816 they took
part for bastide and jausion because fualdes was a buonapartist they
designated the liberals as friends and brothers this constituted the
like certain church towers madame de ts salon had two cocks one of
them was m gillenormand the other was comte de lamothe valois of whom
it was whispered about with a sort of respect do you know that is
the lamothe of the affair of the necklace these singular amnesties do
let us add the following in the bourgeoisie honored situations decay
through too easy relations one must beware whom one admits in the same
way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are
cold there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised
persons the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above
this law as above every other marigny the brother of the pompadour
had his entry with m le prince de soubise in spite of no because du
barry the god father of the vaubernier was very welcome at the house
of m le marechal de richelieu this society is olympus mercury and
the prince de guemenee are at home there a thief is admitted there
the comte de lamothe who in 1815 was an old man seventy five years of
age had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious
air his cold and angular face his perfectly polished manners his coat
buttoned up to his cravat and his long legs always crossed in long
flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna his face was the same color
this m de lamothe was held in consideration in this salon on account
of his celebrity and strange to say though true because of his name
as for m gillenormand his consideration was of absolutely first rate
quality he had in spite of his levity and without its interfering in
any way with his dignity a certain manner about him which was imposing
dignified honest and lofty in a bourgeois fashion and his great
age added to it one is not a century with impunity the years finally
in addition to this he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the
old rock thus when the king of prussia after having restored louis
xviii came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the count de
ruppin he was received by the descendant of louis xiv somewhat
as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg and with the most
delicate impertinence m gillenormand approved all kings who are
not the king of france said he are provincial kings one day the
following question was put and the following answer returned in his
presence to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned
to be suspended sus is superfluous observed m gillenormand22
at the te deum on the anniversary of the return of the bourbons he
said on seeing m de talleyrand pass by there goes his excellency the
m gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter that tall
mademoiselle who was over forty and looked fifty and by a handsome
little boy of seven years white rosy fresh with happy and trusting
eyes who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur
around him how handsome he is what a pity poor child this child
was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago he was called poor
child because he had for a father a brigand of the loire
this brigand of the loire was m gillenormands son in law who has
already been mentioned and whom m gillenormand called the disgrace of
chapter ii one of the red spectres of that epoch
any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at
this epoch and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental
bridge which will soon be succeeded let us hope by some hideous iron
cable bridge might have observed had he dropped his eyes over the
parapet a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap and
trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth to which something yellow
which had been a red ribbon was sewn shod with wooden sabots tanned
by the sun his face nearly black and his hair nearly white a large
scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek bowed bent
prematurely aged who walked nearly every day hoe and sickle in hand
in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the
bridge and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces
charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say were they
much larger these are gardens and were they a little smaller these
are bouquets all these enclosures abut upon the river at one end and
on a house at the other the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes
of whom we have just spoken inhabited the smallest of these enclosures
and the most humble of these houses about 1817 he lived there alone and
solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young nor
old neither homely nor pretty neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise who
served him the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated
in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there
by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of
water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had
invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been
forgotten by nature he was ingenious he had forestalled soulange
bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould for the
cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china he
was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting
hoeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness
sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful
for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a
child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of
a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle his table was very
plain and he drank more milk than wine a child could make him give
way and his servant scolded him he was so timid that he seemed shy he
rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his
pane and his cure the abbe mabeuf a good old man nevertheless if the
inhabitants of the town or strangers or any chance comers curious to
see his tulips rang at his little cottage he opened his door with a
smile he was the brigand of the loire
any one who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies
the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been
struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name
of georges pontmercy when very young this georges pontmercy had been
a soldier in saintonges regiment the revolution broke out saintonges
regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments
of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall
of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in 1794 pontmercy
fought at spire at worms at neustadt at turkheim at alzey at
mayence where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchards
rearguard it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps
of the prince of hesse behind the old rampart of andernach and only
rejoined the main body of the army when the enemys cannon had opened
a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis he was
under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of mont palissel where
a ball from a biscaien broke his arm then he passed to the frontier
of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col
de tende with joubert joubert was appointed its adjutant general and
pontmercy sub lieutenant pontmercy was by berthiers side in the midst
of the grape shot of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say
berthier has been cannoneer cavalier and grenadier he beheld his
old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted
sabre he was shouting forward having been embarked with his
company in the exigencies of the campaign on board a pinnace which was
proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into
a wasps nest of seven or eight english vessels the genoese commander
wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between
decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel pontmercy had
the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns
of the british frigates twenty leagues further on his audacity having
increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english
transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded
down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the
sea in 1805 he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the
archduke ferdinand at weltingen he received into his arms beneath a
storm of bullets colonel maupetit mortally wounded at the head of the
9th dragoons he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable
march in echelons effected under the enemys fire when the cavalry of
the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line
pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the
guard the emperor gave him the cross pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua
melas and alexandria mack at ulm made prisoners in succession
he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier
commanded and which captured hamburg then he was transferred to the
55th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders at eylau
he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic
captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained
alone with his company of eighty three men every effort of the hostile
army pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that
cemetery he was at friedland then he saw moscow then la beresina
then lutzen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and the defiles of
gelenhausen then montmirail chateau thierry craon the banks of the
marne the banks of the aisne and the redoubtable position of laon at
arnay le duc being then a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword
and saved not his general but his corporal he was well slashed up on
this occasion and twenty seven splinters were extracted from his left
arm alone eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just
exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry he had what was called
under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude
for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier or a squadron or
a battalion as an officer it is from this aptitude perfected by a
military education which certain special branches of the service arise
the dragoons for example who are both cavalry men and infantry at one
and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba at
waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade
it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion he came
and cast the flag at the emperors feet he was covered with blood
while tearing down the banner he had received a sword cut across his
face the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him you are a colonel
you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy
replied sire i thank you for my widow an hour later he fell in the
ravine of ohain now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same
we have already seen something of his history after waterloo
pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it
will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged
himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the
the restoration had placed him on half pay then had sent him into
residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis
xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred
days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an
officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title
of baron he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself
colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never
went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion
of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities
would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this
notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy
retorted with a bitter smile i do not know whether i no longer
understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is
that i do not understand then he went out for eight successive days
with his rosette they dared not interfere with him two or three times
the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote
to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy
he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken at the same moment
napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives
of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte pontmercy had ended
may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same
in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused
to salute flaminius and who had a little of hannibals spirit
one day he encountered the district attorney in one of the streets of
vernon stepped up to him and said mr crown attorney am i permitted
he had nothing save his meagre half pay as chief of squadron he had
hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there
alone we have just seen how under the empire between two wars he
had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois
thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh
saying the greatest families are forced into it in 1815 madame
pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in
sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a
child this child had been the colonels joy in his solitude but the
grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if
the child were not given to him he would disinherit him the father had
yielded in the little ones interest and had transferred his love to
moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief
nor conspired he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which
he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his
time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz
m gillenormand kept up no relations with his son in law the colonel
was a bandit to him m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel
except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship
it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see
his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed
over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy
was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the
child in their own way perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these
conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right
the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the
inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable
this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal
side and her sisters son was her natural heir the boy whose name was
marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened
his mouth to him about it nevertheless in the society into which his
grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually
enlightened the little boys mind he had finally understood something
of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which
were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and
slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with
shame and with a pain at his heart
while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every
two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking
his ban and went and posted himself at saint sulpice at the hour when
aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt
should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to
breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that
from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m labbe
that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of saint sulpice who had
often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek
and the large tears in his eyes that man who had so manly an air yet
who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung
to his mind one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had
encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man
of saint sulpice the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure
and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other this
visit led to others the colonel who had been extremely reserved at
first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally
came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his
happiness to his childs future this caused the cure to regard him with
veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond
of the cure and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so
penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old
priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same the one has
devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on
twice a year on the first of january and on st georges day marius
wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and
which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was
all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with
very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread
madame de ts salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world it
was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life this
opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came
to him through this skylight this child who had been all joy and light
on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is
still more contrary to his age grave surrounded by all those singular
and imposing personages he gazed about him with serious amazement
everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him there were
in madame de ts salon some very noble ladies named mathan noe
levis which was pronounced levi cambis pronounced cambyse these
antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the childs mind
with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they
were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire sparely lighted
by a lamp shaded with green with their severe profiles their gray or
white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors
could not be distinguished dropping at rare intervals words which
were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with
frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but
patriarchs and magi not real beings but phantoms
with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequenters of
this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de sass private
secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published
under the pseudonyme of charles antoine monorhymed odes the prince de
beauff who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and
witty wife whose very low necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold
torsades alarmed these shadows the marquis de cde the man
in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comte
dam the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de
port de guy a pillar of the library of the louvre called the kings
cabinet m de port de guy bald and rather aged than old was wont
to relate that in 1793 at the age of sixteen he had been put in the
galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian the bishop
of mirepoix also refractory but as a priest while he was so in the
capacity of a soldier this was at toulon their business was to go at
night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons
who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs
these dripping corpses and their red galley slave blouses had a clot of
blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and wet at
night these tragic tales abounded in madame de ts salon and by
dint of cursing marat they applauded trestaillon some deputies of the
undiscoverable variety played their whist there m thibord du chalard
m lemarchant de gomicourt and the celebrated scoffer of the right m
cornet dincourt the bailiff de ferrette with his short breeches
and his thin legs sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de
talleyrand he had been m le comte dartois companion in pleasures and
unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the guimard crawl
on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher
avenged by a bailiff as for the priests there was the abbe halma the
same to whom m larose his collaborator on la foudre said bah who
is there who is not fifty years old a few greenhorns perhaps the abbe
letourneur preacher to the king the abbe frayssinous who was not as
yet either count or bishop or minister or peer and who wore an old
cassock whose buttons were missing and the abbe keravenant cure of
saint germain des pres also the popes nuncio then monsignor macchi
archbishop of nisibi later on cardinal remarkable for his long
pensive nose and another monsignor entitled thus abbate palmieri
domestic prelate one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the
holy see canon of the illustrious liberian basilica advocate of the
saints postulatore dei santi which refers to matters of canonization
and signifies very nearly master of requests of the section of
paradise lastly two cardinals m de la luzerne and m de cl
t the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have
a few years later the honor of signing in the conservateur articles
side by side with chateaubriand m de cl t was archbishop
of toul and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis
de t who was minister of marine and war the cardinal of
cl t was a merry little man who displayed his red
stockings beneath his tucked up cassock his specialty was a hatred of
the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who
at that epoch passed through the rue m on summer evenings where
the hotel de cl t then stood halted to listen to the shock
of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his
conclavist monseigneur cotiret bishop in partibus of caryste mark
abbe i make a cannon the cardinal de cl t had been
brought to madame de ts by his most intimate friend m de roquelaure
former bishop of senlis and one of the forty m de roquelaure was
notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through
the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french
academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday
contemplate the ex bishop of senlis usually standing erect freshly
powdered in violet hose with his back turned to the door apparently
for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar all
these ecclesiastics though for the most part as much courtiers as
churchmen added to the gravity of the t salon whose seigniorial
aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vib
the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damb
and the duc de val this duc de val although prince de
mon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of
france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium
it was he who said the cardinals are the peers of france of rome
the lords are the peers of france of england moreover as it is
indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century
this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois m
there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society
there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine
there is always a trace of anarchy in renown chateaubriand had he
entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene some of
the scoffed at did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte
the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons
the faubourg saint germain reeks of the fagot even now the royalists of
to day are demagogues let us record it to their credit
at madame de ts the society was superior taste was exquisite and
haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there
admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old
regime itself buried but still alive some of these habits especially
in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially
acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only
antique a woman was called madame la generale madame la colonelle was
not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no
doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this
appellation to her title of princesse the marquise de crequy was also
it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the
refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third
person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty
men and deeds were brought to judgment there they jeered at the age
which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted
each other in amazement they communicated to each other that modicum
of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on
epimenides the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course
of things they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz
had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii was by the grace
of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were
by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence
all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted
to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus
there were some young people but they were rather dead the liveries in
the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were
they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately
resisting the sepulchre nearly the whole dictionary consisted of
conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the
point there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable
groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society the
masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw
a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary
what did they do in madame de ts salon they were ultra
to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have
disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us
to be ultra is to go beyond it is to attack the sceptre in the name of
the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to ill treat
the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is
to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by
heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry
it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the
pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently
royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented
with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of
whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming
their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against
the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the
nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in
1814 and terminates about 1820 with the advent of m de villele
the practical man of the right these six years were an extraordinary
moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and
sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at
the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still
filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past there existed
in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world
comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing
resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france
with ill temper and which france regarded with irony good old owls
of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the
former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen
who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold
their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the
nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to
say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had
lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne
disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just
remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and
nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and
was only a sabre former days did not recognize yesterday people no
longer had the feeling for what was grand there was some one who called
bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists nothing of it we
repeat exists to day when we select from it some one figure at random
and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us
as the world before the deluge it is because it too as a matter of
fact has been engulfed in a deluge it has disappeared beneath two
revolutions what billows are ideas how quickly they cover all that it
is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create
such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times
when m martainville had more wit than voltaire
these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed
in fievee m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m
colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais napoleon
was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into
history of m le marquis de bonaparte lieutenant general of the kings
armies was a concession to the spirit of the age
these salons did not long preserve their purity beginning with 1818
doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way
was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the
ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had
wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated
with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully
too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned
coats the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to
create aged youth they assumed the poses of wise men they dreamed of
engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle
they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative
liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes they were heard to say
thanks for royalism it has rendered more than one service it has
brought back tradition worship religion respect it is faithful
brave chivalric loving devoted it has mingled though with regret
the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the
nation its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire
glory liberty young ideas young generations the age but this
mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been
guilty of it towards them the revolution whose heirs we are ought to
be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of
liberalism what an error and what blindness revolutionary france is
wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its
mother that is to say towards itself after the 5th of september the
nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was
treated after the 5th of july they were unjust to the eagle we are
unjust to the fleur de lys it seems that we must always have something
to proscribe does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis
xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de
vaublanc for erasing the ns from the bridge of jena what was it that
he did what are we doing bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo
the fleurs de lys are ours as well as the ns that is our patrimony to
what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the
past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history
it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which
was displeased at criticism and furious at protection
the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation
characterized the second skill follows ardor let us confine ourselves
in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered
in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been
forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of
the singular features of this society which is unknown to day but he
does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea souvenirs both
respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to
this past moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur
of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate
it it was the france of former days
marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do when he
emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided
him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this
young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant
marius went through his years of college then he entered the law
school he was a royalist fanatical and severe he did not love his
grandfather much as the latters gayety and cynicism repelled him and
he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud
religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness
the conclusion of marius classical studies coincided with m
gillenormands departure from society the old man bade farewell to
the faubourg saint germain and to madame de ts salon and established
himself in the mardis in his house of the rue des filles du calvaire
there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid
nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that short breathed and
in 1827 marius had just attained his seventeenth year one evening on
his return home he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand
marius said m gillenormand you will set out for vernon to morrow
marius was seized with a trembling fit he had thought of everything
except this that he should one day be called upon to see his father
nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit
it more disagreeable to him it was forcing estrangement into
reconciliation it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty
marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced
that his father the slasher as m gillenormand called him on his
amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned
him to others feeling that he was not beloved he did not love
nothing is more simple he said to himself
he was so astounded that he did not question m gillenormand the
it appears that he is ill he demands your presence
set out to morrow morning i think there is a coach which leaves the
cour des fontaines at six oclock and which arrives in the evening
take it he says that here is haste
then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket
marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his
father on the following morning a diligence from the rue du bouloi
took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon
neither marius nor m gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it
the next day at twilight marius reached vernon people were just
beginning to light their candles he asked the first person whom he
met for m pontmercys house for in his own mind he agreed with the
restoration and like it did not recognize his fathers claim to the
the house was pointed out to him he rang a woman with a little lamp in
but i am his son persisted marius he is expecting me
he no longer expects you said the woman
