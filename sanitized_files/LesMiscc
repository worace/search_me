the posts recourse to arms was not without result the cart was
conquered the drunken man was taken prisoner the first was put in the
pound the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils
of war as an accomplice the public ministry of the day proved its
indefatigable zeal in the defence of society in this instance
gavroches adventure which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters
of the temple is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly
bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their memories the
nocturnal attack by the post of the royal printing establishment
chapter i the charybdis of the faubourg saint antoine and the scylla of
the two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies
can name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work
is laid these two barricades both of them symbols under two different
aspects of a redoubtable situation sprang from the earth at the time
of the fatal insurrection of june 1848 the greatest war of the streets
it sometimes happens that even contrary to principles even contrary to
liberty equality and fraternity even contrary to the universal vote
even contrary to the government by all for all from the depths of its
anguish of its discouragements and its destitutions of its fevers of
its distresses of its miasmas of its ignorances of its darkness that
great and despairing body the rabble protests against and that the
beggars attack the common right the ochlocracy rises against demos
these are melancholy days for there is always a certain amount of night
even in this madness there is suicide in this duel and those words
which are intended to be insults beggars canaille ochlocracy
populace exhibit alas rather the fault of those who reign than the
fault of those who suffer rather the fault of the privileged than the
for our own part we never pronounce those words without pain and
without respect for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they
correspond it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries athens
was an ochlocracy the beggars were the making of holland the populace
saved rome more than once and the rabble followed jesus christ
there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences
it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking no doubt and of
all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable
people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs when he uttered this
mysterious saying fex urbis lex orbis the dregs of the city the
the exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds its violences
contrary to all sense directed against the principles which are its
life its masterful deeds against the right are its popular coups
detat and should be repressed the man of probity sacrifices himself
and out of his very love for this crowd he combats it but how
excusable he feels it even while holding out against it how he
venerates it even while resisting it this is one of those rare moments
when while doing that which it is ones duty to do one feels something
which disconcerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding
further one persists it is necessary but conscience though
satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a
june 1848 let us hasten to say was an exceptional fact and almost
impossible of classification in the philosophy of history all the
words which we have just uttered must be discarded when it becomes
a question of this extraordinary revolt in which one feels the holy
anxiety of toil claiming its rights it was necessary to combat it and
this was a duty for it attacked the republic but what was june 1848
at bottom a revolt of the people against itself
where the subject is not lost sight of there is no digression may we
then be permitted to arrest the readers attention for a moment on the
two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which
one blocked the entrance to the faubourg saint antoine the other
defended the approach to the faubourg du temple those before whom these
two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the
brilliant blue sky of june will never forget them
the saint antoine barricade was tremendous it was three stories high
and seven hundred feet wide it barred the vast opening of the faubourg
that is to say three streets from angle to angle ravined jagged
cut up divided crenelated with an immense rent buttressed with piles
that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there
powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the
faubourg it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the
formidable place which had seen the 14th of july nineteen barricades
were ranged one behind the other in the depths of the streets
behind this principal barricade at the very sight of it one felt the
agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg which had reached that
point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe of what was
that barricade made of the ruins of three six story houses demolished
expressly said some of the prodigy of all wraths said others it wore
the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred ruin it might be
asked who built this it might also be said who destroyed this it was
the improvisation of the ebullition hold take this door this grating
this penthouse this chimney piece this broken brazier this cracked
pot give all cast away all push this roll dig dismantle overturn
ruin everything it was the collaboration of the pavement the block of
stone the beam the bar of iron the rag the scrap the broken pane
the unseated chair the cabbage stalk the tatter the rag and the
malediction it was grand and it was petty it was the abyss parodied
on the public place by hubbub the mass beside the atom the strip of
ruined wall and the broken bowl threatening fraternization of
every sort of rubbish sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job his
potsherd terrible in short it was the acropolis of the barefooted
overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope an immense dray was
spread out there crossways its axle pointing heavenward and seemed a
scar on that tumultuous facade an omnibus hoisted gayly by main force
to the very summit of the heap as though the architects of this bit of
savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their
terror presented its horseless unharnessed pole to no one knows what
horses of the air this gigantic heap the alluvium of the revolt
figured to the mind an ossa on pelion of all revolutions 93 on 89
the 9th of thermidor on the 10th of august the 18th of brumaire on the
11th of january vendemiaire on prairial 1848 on 1830 the situation
deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very
spot whence the bastille had disappeared if the ocean made dikes it
is thus that it would build the fury of the flood was stamped upon this
shapeless mass what flood the crowd one thought one beheld hubbub
petrified one thought one heard humming above this barricade as though
there had been over their hive enormous dark bees of violent progress
was it a thicket was it a bacchanalia was it a fortress vertigo
seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings there was
something of the cess pool in that redoubt and something olympian in
that confusion one there beheld in a pell mell full of despair the
rafters of roofs bits of garret windows with their figured paper
window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting
the cannon wrecks of chimneys cupboards tables benches howling
topsyturveydom and those thousand poverty stricken things the very
refuse of the mendicant which contain at the same time fury and
nothingness one would have said that it was the tatters of a people
rags of wood of iron of bronze of stone and that the faubourg saint
antoine had thrust it there at its door with a colossal flourish of the
broom making of its misery its barricade blocks resembling headsmans
blocks dislocated chains pieces of woodwork with brackets having
the form of gibbets horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish
amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old
tortures endured by the people the barricade saint antoine converted
everything into a weapon everything that civil war could throw at the
head of society proceeded thence it was not combat it was a paroxysm
the carbines which defended this redoubt among which there were some
blunderbusses sent bits of earthenware bones coat buttons even the
casters from night stands dangerous projectiles on account of
the brass this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an
inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it
was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming
heads crowned it a swarm filled it it had a thorny crest of guns of
sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag
flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of
drums the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving
were to be heard there it was huge and living and like the back of an
electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning the
spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled
that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange
majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish it was a heap of
as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the
revolution what the revolution it that barricade chance hazard
disorder terror misunderstanding the unknown had facing it the
constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people universal suffrage
the nation the republic and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to
immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero
the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance the faubourg
shouldered the redoubt the redoubt took its stand under cover of the
faubourg the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which
the strategy of the african generals dashed itself its caverns its
excrescences its warts its gibbosities grimaced so to speak and
grinned beneath the smoke the mitraille vanished in shapelessness the
bombs plunged into it bullets only succeeded in making holes in it
what was the use of cannonading chaos and the regiments accustomed to
the fiercest visions of war gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of
redoubt a wild beast in its boar like bristling and a mountain by its
a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which
debouches on the boulevard near the chateaudeau if one thrust ones
head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the dallemagne shop
one perceived in the distance beyond the canal in the street which
mounts the slopes of belleville at the culminating point of the rise a
strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort
of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as
though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order
to close itself abruptly this wall was built of paving stones it was
straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid
out by rule and line cement was lacking of course but as in the case
of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture
the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base from distance
to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible
loopholes which resembled black threads these loopholes were separated
from each other by equal spaces the street was deserted as far as the
eye could reach all windows and doors were closed in the background
rose this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the street a
motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible
not a cry not a sound not a breath a sepulchre
the dazzling sun of june inundated this terrible thing with light
it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple
as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was
impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before
this mysterious apparition it was adjusted jointed imbricated
rectilinear symmetrical and funereal science and gloom met there one
felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre
from time to time if some soldier an officer or representative of the
people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle
was heard and the passer by fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the
bullet sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed
shutter in the interstice between two blocks of stone or in the
plaster of a wall for the men in the barricade had made themselves two
small cannons out of two cast iron lengths of gas pipe plugged up at
one end with tow and fire clay there was no waste of useless powder
nearly every shot told there were corpses here and there and pools of
blood on the pavement i remember a white butterfly which went and came
in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were
one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one
understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street
massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms
at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking
column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this
immobility this passivity whence sprang death some crawled flat on
their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge taking care
that their shakos did not project beyond it
the valiant colonel monteynard admired this barricade with a
shudder how that is built he said to a representative not one
paving stone projects beyond its neighbor it is made of porcelain at
that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell
the cowards people said let them show themselves let us see them
the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men
attacked by ten thousand held out for three days on the fourth they
did as at zaatcha as at constantine they pierced the houses they came
over the roofs the barricade was taken not one of the eighty cowards
thought of flight all were killed there with the exception of the
leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently
the saint antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders the barricade
of the temple was silence the difference between these two redoubts
was the difference between the formidable and the sinister one seemed a
admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed
of a wrath and of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the
these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one
cournet the other barthelemy cournet made the saint antoine
barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple each was the image of
cournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face
a crushing fist a bold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible eye
intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the
most formidable of combatants war strife conflict were the very air
he breathed and put him in a good humor he had been an officer in the
navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang
from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the
hurricane on into battle with the exception of the genius there was
in cournet something of danton as with the exception of the divinity
barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street
urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman lay in wait for
him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys he came
later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy
slew cournet it was a funereal duel some time afterwards caught in
the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion
plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating
circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy
was hanged the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to
material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy being
who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began
in france with the galleys and ended in england with the gallows
barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag
chapter ii what is to be done in the abyss if one does not converse
sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection and
june 1848 knew a great deal more about it than june 1832 so the
barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie was only an outline and an embryo
compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched but
the insurgents under the eye of enjolras for marius no longer looked
after anything had made good use of the night the barricade had been
not only repaired but augmented they had raised it two feet bars
of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest all sorts of
rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external
confusion the redoubt had been cleverly made over into a wall on the
the staircase of paving stones which permitted one to mount it like the
the barricade had been put in order the tap room disencumbered the
kitchen appropriated for the ambulance the dressing of the wounded
completed the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been
gathered up bullets run cartridges manufactured lint scraped the
fallen weapons re distributed the interior of the redoubt cleaned the
they laid the dead in a heap in the mondetour lane of which they were
still the masters the pavement was red for a long time at that spot
among the dead there were four national guardsmen of the suburbs
enjolras had advised two hours of sleep advice from enjolras was a
command still only three or four took advantage of it
feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the
these four words hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail could be
the three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish
definitely which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely
they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house
the greater part of the wounded were able and wished to fight still
on a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen which had
been converted into an ambulance there were five men gravely wounded
two of whom were municipal guardsmen the municipal guardsmen were
in the tap room there remained only mabeuf under his black cloth and
this is the hall of the dead said enjolras
in the interior of this hall barely lighted by a candle at one end the
mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar a sort of
vast vague cross resulted from javert erect and mabeuf lying prone
the pole of the omnibus although snapped off by the fusillade was
still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it
enjolras who possessed that quality of a leader of always doing what
he said attached to this staff the bullet ridden and bloody coat of the
no repast had been possible there was neither bread nor meat the fifty
men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of
the wine shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there at a
given moment every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la meduse
they were obliged to resign themselves to hunger they had then reached
the first hours of that spartan day of the 6th of june when in the
barricade saint merry jeanne surrounded by the insurgents who demanded
bread replied to all combatants crying something to eat with why
it is three oclock at four we shall be dead
as they could no longer eat enjolras forbade them to drink he
they had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed
enjolras and combeferre examined them combeferre when he came up again
said its the old stock of father hucheloup who began business as
a grocer it must be real wine observed bossuet its lucky that
grantaire is asleep if he were on foot there would be a good deal of
difficulty in saving those bottles enjolras in spite of all murmurs
placed his veto on the fifteen bottles and in order that no one might
touch them he had them placed under the table on which father mabeuf
about two oclock in the morning they reckoned up their strength there
the day began to dawn the torch which had been replaced in its
cavity in the pavement had just been extinguished the interior of the
barricade that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street
was bathed in shadows and resembled athwart the vague twilight
horror the deck of a disabled ship the combatants as they went
and came moved about there like black forms above that terrible
nesting place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly
outlined at the very top the chimneys stood palely out the sky was of
that charming undecided hue which may be white and may be blue birds
flew about in it with cries of joy the lofty house which formed the
back of the barricade being turned to the east had upon its roof a
rosy reflection the morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of
the dead man at the third story window
i am delighted that the torch has been extinguished said courfeyrac
to feuilly that torch flickering in the wind annoyed me it had the
appearance of being afraid the light of torches resembles the wisdom of
cowards it gives a bad light because it trembles
dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk
joly perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter extracted philosophy from
what is the cat he exclaimed it is a corrective the good god
having made the mouse said hullo i have committed a blunder and
so he made the cat the cat is the erratum of the mouse the mouse plus
the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected
combeferre surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the
dead of jean prouvaire of bahorel of mabeuf and even of cabuc and
charlotte corday sand have all had their moment of agony when it was
too late our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that
even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if
there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the
and such are the windings of the exchange of speech that a moment
later by a transition brought about through jean prouvaires verses
combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgics raux with
cournand cournand with delille pointing out the passages translated
by malfilatre particularly the prodigies of caesars death and at that
caesar said combeferre fell justly cicero was severe towards
caesar and he was right that severity is not diatribe when zoilus
insults homer when maevius insults virgil when vise insults moliere
when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an
old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts
insult great men are always more or less barked at but zoilus and
cicero are two different persons cicero is an arbiter in thought just
as brutus is an arbiter by the sword for my own part i blame that last
justice the blade but antiquity admitted it caesar the violator
of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities
which emanated from the people not rising at the entrance of the
senate committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant regia ac
pene tyrannica he was a great man so much the worse or so much the
better the lesson is but the more exalted his twenty three wounds
touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ caesar is
stabbed by the senators christ is cuffed by lackeys one feels the god
bossuet who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap
oh cydathenaeum oh myrrhinus oh probalinthus oh graces of the
aeantides oh who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a
enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance he had made his way out
through mondetour lane gliding along close to the houses
the insurgents we will remark were full of hope the manner in which
they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to
almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn they waited for it with
a smile they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their
cause moreover succor was evidently on the way to them they
reckoned on it with that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one
of the sources of strength in the french combatant they divided the
day which was at hand into three distinct phases at six oclock in the
morning a regiment which had been labored with would turn at noon
the insurrection of all paris at sunset revolution
they heard the alarm bell of saint merry which had not been silent for
an instant since the night before a proof that the other barricade the
all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of
gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of
enjolras reappeared he returned from his sombre eagle flight into outer
darkness he listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms and
one hand on his mouth then fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of
the whole army of paris is to strike a third of the army is bearing
down upon the barricades in which you now are there is the national
guard in addition i have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the
line and the standard bearers of the sixth legion in one hour you will
be attacked as for the populace it was seething yesterday to day
it is not stirring there is nothing to expect nothing to hope for
neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment you are abandoned
these words fell upon the buzzing of the groups and produced on them
the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm a
moment of indescribable silence ensued in which death might have been
a voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to enjolras
so be it let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet and
let us all remain in it citizens let us offer the protests of corpses
let us show that if the people abandon the republicans the republicans
these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of
individual anxieties it was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation
no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus he was some
unknown blouse wearer a stranger a man forgotten a passing hero that
great anonymous always mingled in human crises and in social geneses
who at a given moment utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word
and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute
in a lightning flash the people and god
this inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the
6th of june 1832 that almost at the very same hour on the barricade
saint merry the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a
matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the
case what matters it whether they come to our assistance or not let
us get ourselves killed here to the very last man
as the reader sees the two barricades though materially isolated were
after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had
given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a
strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal in sense and triumphant
long live death let us all remain here
the position is good the barricade is fine thirty men are enough why
citizens cried enjolras and there was an almost irritated vibration
in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in
useless expenditure of them vain glory is waste if the duty of some is
to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other
enjolras the man principle had over his co religionists that sort of
omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute still great as was
this omnipotence a murmur arose a leader to the very finger tips
enjolras seeing that they murmured insisted he resumed haughtily
let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so
besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk
not on the side of the halles said enjolras the rue mondetour is
free and through the rue des precheurs one can reach the marche des
and there went on another voice you would be captured you would
fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs they will spy
a man passing in blouse and cap whence come you dont you belong to
the barricade and they will look at your hands you smell of powder
enjolras without making any reply touched combeferres shoulder and
they emerged thence a moment later enjolras held in his outstretched
hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside combeferre followed
with this uniform said enjolras you can mingle with the ranks and
escape here is enough for four and he flung on the ground deprived
no wavering took place in his stoical audience combeferre took the
come said he you must have a little pity do you know what the
question is here it is a question of women see here are there
women or are there not are there children or are there not are there
mothers yes or no who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot
of little ones around them let that man of you who has never beheld a
nurses breast raise his hand ah you want to get yourselves killed so
do i i who am speaking to you but i do not want to feel the phantoms
of women wreathing their arms around me die if you will but
dont make others die suicides like that which is on the brink of
accomplishment here are sublime but suicide is narrow and does not
admit of extension and as soon as it touches your neighbors suicide
is murder think of the little blond heads think of the white locks
listen enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the rue
du cygne a lighted casement a candle in a poor window on the fifth
floor and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman
who had the air of having spent the night in watching perhaps she is
the mother of some one of you well let that man go and make haste to
say to his mother here i am mother let him feel at ease the task
here will be performed all the same when one supports ones relatives
by ones toil one has not the right to sacrifice ones self that
is deserting ones family and those who have daughters what are you
thinking of you get yourselves killed you are dead that is well and
tomorrow young girls without bread that is a terrible thing man begs
woman sells ah those charming and gracious beings so gracious and so
sweet who have bonnets of flowers who fill the house with purity who
sing and prattle who are like a living perfume who prove the existence
of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth that jeanne
that lise that mimi those adorable and honest creatures who are your
blessings and your pride ah good god they will suffer hunger what do
you want me to say to you there is a market for human flesh and it
is not with your shadowy hands shuddering around them that you
will prevent them from entering it think of the street think of the
pavement covered with passers by think of the shops past which women
go and come with necks all bare and through the mire these women
too were pure once think of your sisters those of you who have them
misery prostitution the police saint lazare that is what those
beautiful delicate girls those fragile marvels of modesty gentleness
and loveliness fresher than lilacs in the month of may will come to
ah you have got yourselves killed you are no longer on hand that
is well you have wished to release the people from royalty and you
deliver over your daughters to the police friends have a care have
mercy women unhappy women we are not in the habit of bestowing much
thought on them we trust to the women not having received a mans
education we prevent their reading we prevent their thinking we
prevent their occupying themselves with politics will you prevent them
from going to the dead house this evening and recognizing your bodies
let us see those who have families must be tractable and shake hands
with us and take themselves off and leave us here alone to attend to
this affair i know well that courage is required to leave that it is
hard but the harder it is the more meritorious you say i have a
gun i am at the barricade so much the worse i shall remain there so
much the worse is easily said my friends there is a morrow you will
not be here to morrow but your families will and what sufferings see
here is a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple who babbles
prattles chatters who laughs who smells sweet beneath your kiss and
do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned i have seen one
a very small creature no taller than that his father was dead poor
people had taken him in out of charity but they had bread only for
themselves the child was always hungry it was winter he did not cry
you could see him approach the stove in which there was never any fire
and whose pipe you know was of mastic and yellow clay his breathing
was hoarse his face livid his limbs flaccid his belly prominent he
said nothing if you spoke to him he did not answer he is dead he was
taken to the necker hospital where i saw him i was house surgeon in
that hospital now if there are any fathers among you fathers whose
happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their childs tiny hand in
their robust hand let each one of those fathers imagine that this child
is his own that poor brat i remember and i seem to see him now when
he lay nude on the dissecting table how his ribs stood out on his skin
like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery a sort of mud was found
in his stomach there were ashes in his teeth come let us examine
ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart statistics
show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty five per cent
i repeat it is a question of women it concerns mothers it concerns
young girls it concerns little children who is talking to you of
yourselves we know well what you are we know well that you are all
brave parbleu we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and
the glory of giving your life for the great cause we know well that you
feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently and that each
one of you clings to his share in the triumph very well but you are
not alone in this world there are other beings of whom you must think
all dropped their heads with a gloomy air
strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments
combeferre who spoke thus was not an orphan he recalled the mothers
of other men and forgot his own he was about to get himself killed he
marius fasting fevered having emerged in succession from all hope
and having been stranded in grief the most sombre of shipwrecks and
saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near
had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always
a physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that
febrile absorption known to and classified by science and which is
to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure despair also has its
ecstasy marius had reached this point he looked on at everything as
from without as we have said things which passed before him seemed far
away he made out the whole but did not perceive the details he beheld
men going and coming as through a flame he heard voices speaking as at
but this moved him there was in this scene a point which pierced and
roused even him he had but one idea now to die and he did not wish to
be turned aside from it but he reflected in his gloomy somnambulism
that while destroying himself he was not prohibited from saving some
enjolras and combeferre are right said he no unnecessary sacrifice
i join them and you must make haste combeferre has said convincing
things to you there are some among you who have families mothers
sisters wives children let such leave the ranks
married men and the supporters of families step out of the ranks
his authority was great enjolras was certainly the head of the
then touched by combeferres words shaken by enjolras order touched
by marius entreaty these heroic men began to denounce each other it
is true said one young man to a full grown man you are the father
of a family go it is your duty rather retorted the man you have
two sisters whom you maintain and an unprecedented controversy broke
forth each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be
make haste said courfeyrac in another quarter of an hour it will be
citizens pursued enjolras this is the republic and universal
suffrage reigns do you yourselves designate those who are to go
they obeyed after the expiration of a few minutes five were
unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks
well began the five one must stay behind
and then a struggle arose as to who should remain and who should find
reasons for the others not remaining the generous quarrel began afresh
you have a wife who loves you you have your aged mother  you
have neither father nor mother and what is to become of your three
little brothers you are the father of five children you have a
right to live you are only seventeen it is too early for you to die
these great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism
the improbable was simple there these men did not astonish each other
yes said the five choose we will obey you
marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion still
at this idea that of choosing a man for death his blood rushed back
to his heart he would have turned pale had it been possible for him to
he advanced towards the five who smiled upon him and each with his
eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history
and marius stupidly counted them there were still five of them then
at that moment a fifth uniform fell as if from heaven upon the other
marius raised his eyes and recognized m fauchelevent
he had arrived by way of mondetour lane whither by dint of inquiries
made or by instinct or chance thanks to his dress of a national
guardsman he had made his way without difficulty
the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue mondetour had no
occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman and he had
allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street saying to himself
probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner the
moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and
at the moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt no one had noticed
him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms
jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his
coat and flung it on the pile with the rest
he is a man who saves others replied combeferre
you know that we are about to die
jean valjean without replying helped the insurgent whom he was saving
chapter v the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade
the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place had as
enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was
incomplete however so far as the absolute can be so he had too much
of saint just about him and not enough of anacharsis cloots still
his mind in the society of the friends of the a b c had ended by
undergoing a certain polarization from combeferres ideas for some time
past he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma and
had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress
and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution
the transformation of the great french republic into the immense
human republic as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent
situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never
varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is
summed up in the words eighty three enjolras was standing erect on
the staircase of paving stones one elbow resting on the stock of
his gun he was engaged in thought he quivered as at the passage of
prophetic breaths places where death is have these effects of tripods
a sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes which were filled with an
inward look all at once he threw back his head his blond locks fell
back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars they
were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo and
citizens do you picture the future to yourselves the streets of
cities inundated with light green branches on the thresholds nations
sisters men just old men blessing children the past loving the
present thinkers entirely at liberty believers on terms of full
equality for religion heaven god the direct priest human conscience
become an altar no more hatreds the fraternity of the workshop and the
school for sole penalty and recompense fame work for all right for
all peace over all no more bloodshed no more wars happy mothers to
conquer matter is the first step to realize the ideal is the second
reflect on what progress has already accomplished formerly the
first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes
breathing on the waters the dragon which vomited flame the griffin who
was the monster of the air and who flew with the wings of an eagle
and the talons of a tiger fearful beasts which were above man man
nevertheless spread his snares consecrated by intelligence and
finally conquered these monsters we have vanquished the hydra and
it is called the locomotive we are on the point of vanquishing the
griffin we already grasp it and it is called the balloon on the day
when this promethean task shall be accomplished and when man shall have
definitely harnessed to his will the triple chimaera of antiquity the
hydra the dragon and the griffin he will be the master of water fire
and of air and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which
the ancient gods formerly were to him courage and onward citizens
whither are we going to science made government to the force of things
become the sole public force to the natural law having in itself its
sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence to a dawn
of truth corresponding to a dawn of day we are advancing to the union
of peoples we are advancing to the unity of man no more fictions
no more parasites the real governed by the true that is the goal
civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of europe and
later on at the centre of continents in a grand parliament of the
intelligence something similar has already been seen the amphictyons
had two sittings a year one at delphos the seat of the gods the other
at thermopylae the place of heroes europe will have her amphictyons
the globe will have its amphictyons france bears this sublime future in
her breast this is the gestation of the nineteenth century that which
greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by france listen to me
you feuilly valiant artisan man of the people i revere you yes you
clearly behold the future yes you are right you had neither father
nor mother feuilly you adopted humanity for your mother and right
for your father you are about to die that is to say to triumph here
citizens whatever happens to day through our defeat as well as
through our victory it is a revolution that we are about to create
as conflagrations light up a whole city so revolutions illuminate the
whole human race and what is the revolution that we shall cause i have
just told you the revolution of the true from a political point of
view there is but a single principle the sovereignty of man over
himself this sovereignty of myself over myself is called liberty where
two or three of these sovereignties are combined the state begins but
in that association there is no abdication each sovereignty concedes a
certain quantity of itself for the purpose of forming the common right
this quantity is the same for all of us this identity of concession
which each makes to all is called equality common right is nothing
else than the protection of all beaming on the right of each this
protection of all over each is called fraternity the point of
intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society
this intersection being a junction this point is a knot hence what
is called the social bond some say social contract which is the same
thing the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a
bond let us come to an understanding about equality for if liberty
is the summit equality is the base equality citizens is not wholly a
surface vegetation a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks a
proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void legally
speaking it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity
politically it is all votes possessed of the same weight religiously
it is all consciences possessed of the same right equality has an
organ gratuitous and obligatory instruction the right to the alphabet
that is where the beginning must be made the primary school imposed
on all the secondary school offered to all that is the law from an
identical school an identical society will spring yes instruction
light light everything comes from light and to it everything returns
citizens the nineteenth century is great but the twentieth century
will be happy then there will be nothing more like the history of old
we shall no longer as to day have to fear a conquest an invasion
a usurpation a rivalry of nations arms in hand an interruption of
civilization depending on a marriage of kings on a birth in hereditary
tyrannies a partition of peoples by a congress a dismemberment because
of the failure of a dynasty a combat of two religions meeting face
to face like two bucks in the dark on the bridge of the infinite we
shall no longer have to fear famine farming out prostitution arising
from distress misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the
sword and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events
one might almost say there will be no more events we shall be happy
the human race will accomplish its law as the terrestrial globe
accomplishes its law harmony will be re established between the soul
