him back energetically into the hovel these were the three
chimney builders who had flung themselves upon him at the same time
the thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair
at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the
corridor the old man on the bed who seemed under the influence
of wine descended from the pallet and came reeling up with a
one of the chimney builders whose smirched face was lighted up by
the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his daubing
panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille lifted above m leblancs
head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead at the two ends of a
marius could not resist this sight my father he thought forgive
and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol
the shot was on the point of being discharged when thenardiers voice
this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating thenardier
had calmed him there existed in him two men the ferocious man and
the adroit man up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the
presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not
stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and
tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand
dont hurt him he repeated and without suspecting it his first
success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to
paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared
and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting
who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him
from the horrible alternative of allowing ursules father to perish or
a herculean struggle had begun with one blow full in the chest m
leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the
room then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two
more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretches
were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite
millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both
arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the
thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those
beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain
to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m leblanc
disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar
beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds
they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and
there they held him in awe the thenardier woman had not released her
dont you mix yourself up in this affair said thenardier youll
the thenardier obeyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a
now said thenardier search him you other fellows
m leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance
he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six
thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket
no nor watch replied one of the chimney builders
never mind murmured the masked man who carried the big key in the
voice of a ventriloquist hes a tough old fellow
thenardier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes
tie him to the leg of the bed said he
and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the
room by the blow from m leblancs fist and who made no movement he
two of the chimney builders pushed the drunken man into the corner
near the heap of old iron with their feet
babet said thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why
did you bring so many they were not needed
what can you do replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to
be in it this is a bad season theres no business going on
the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital
bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly hewn
m leblanc let them take their own course
the ruffians bound him securely in an upright attitude with his feet
on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remote from
when the last knot had been tied thenardier took a chair and seated
thenardier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments
his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning
marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man
in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a
moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming
metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger
and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on
stand off a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman
monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window you might
have broken your leg now if you will permit me we will converse
quietly in the first place i must communicate to you an observation
which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry
thenardier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped
marius in his agitation m leblanc had barely pronounced a few words
without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six
ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular
mon dieu you might have shouted stop thief a bit and i should not
have thought it improper murder that too is said occasionally
and so far as i am concerned i should not have taken it in bad part
it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find
yourself with persons who dont inspire you with sufficient confidence
you might have done that and no one would have troubled you on that
account you would not even have been gagged and i will tell you why
this room is very private thats its only recommendation but it has
that in its favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produce
about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a
drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would make
a pouf its a handy lodging but in short you did not shout and
it is better so i present you my compliments and i will tell you the
conclusion that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shouts
who comes the police and after the police justice well you have not
made an outcry that is because you dont care to have the police and
the courts come in any more than we do it is because i have long
suspected it you have some interest in hiding something on our side
we have the same interest so we can come to an understanding
as he spoke thus it seemed as though thenardier who kept his eyes
fixed on m leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted
from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner moreover his
language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence
and crafty insolence was reserved and almost choice and in that
rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one
now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood
the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been
carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that
resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter
a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention had
been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful
thenardiers well grounded observation still further obscured for marius
the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom
courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of monsieur leblanc
but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with executioners half
plunged so to speak in a grave which was closing in upon him to the
extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence
of thenardiers wrath as in the presence of his sweetness this man
remained impassive and marius could not refrain from admiring at such a
here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which
did not know the meaning of despair here was one of those men who
command amazement in desperate circumstances extreme as was the crisis
inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony
of the drowning man who opens his horror filled eyes under the water
thenardier rose in an unpretending manner went to the fireplace shoved
aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and
thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner
could plainly see the chisel white hot and spotted here and there with
then thenardier returned to his seat beside m leblanc
i continue said he we can come to an understanding let us arrange
this matter in an amicable way i was wrong to lose my temper just now
i dont know what i was thinking of i went a great deal too far i said
extravagant things for example because you are a millionnaire i told
you that i exacted money a lot of money a deal of money that would
not be reasonable mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses
of your own who has not i dont want to ruin you i am not a greedy
fellow after all i am not one of those people who because they have
the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves
ridiculous why im taking things into consideration and making a
sacrifice on my side i only want two hundred thousand francs
you see that i put not a little water in my wine im very moderate i
dont know the state of your fortune but i do know that you dont stick
at money and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two
hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck
certainly you are reasonable too you havent imagined that i should
take all the trouble i have to day and organized this affair this
evening which has been labor well bestowed in the opinion of these
gentlemen merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink
red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at desnoyers two hundred
thousand francs its surely worth all that this trifle once out of
your pocket i guarantee you that thats the end of the matter and that
you have no further demands to fear you will say to me but i havent
two hundred thousand francs about me oh im not extortionate i dont
demand that i only ask one thing of you have the goodness to write
what i am about to dictate to you
here thenardier paused then he added emphasizing his words and
casting a smile in the direction of the brazier
i warn you that i shall not admit that you dont know how to write
a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile
thenardier pushed the table close to m leblanc and took an inkstand
a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and
in which gleamed the long blade of the knife
he placed the sheet of paper before m leblanc
how do you expect me to write i am bound
thats true excuse me ejaculated thenardier you are quite right
when the prisoners right arm was free thenardier dipped the pen in the
understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our
discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we
shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable
extremities i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you
that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the
letter which you are about to write shall have returned now be so good
the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to thenardier
you address her as thou do you not
parbleu cried thenardier the little one the lark
m leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion
go on nevertheless ejaculated thenardier and he continued to
come immediately i am in absolute need of thee the person who will
deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me i am
m leblanc had written the whole of this
ah erase come with confidence that might lead her to suppose that
everything was not as it should be and that distrust is possible
now pursued thenardier sign it whats your name
the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded
you know well retorted thenardier for the little one i just told
it was evident that thenardier avoided naming the young girl in
question he said the lark he said the little one but he did not
pronounce her name the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret
from his accomplices to mention the name was to deliver the whole
affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was
thenardier with the movement of a cat dashed his hand into his pocket
and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on m leblanc he
looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle
u f thats it urbain fabre well sign it u f
as two hands are required to fold the letter give it to me i will
address it mademoiselle fabre at your house i know that you live
a long distance from here near saint jacquesdu haut pas because you go
to mass there every day but i dont know in what street i see that
you understand your situation as you have not lied about your name you
will not lie about your address write it yourself
the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and
mademoiselle fabre at m urbain fabres rue saint dominique denfer
thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion
heres the letter you know what you have to do there is a carriage at
the door set out at once and return ditto
and addressing the man with the meat axe
since you have taken off your nose screen accompany the mistress you
will get up behind the fiacre you know where you left the team
and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame thenardier
as they set off thenardier thrust his head through the half open door
above all things dont lose the letter remember that you carry two
be easy i have it in my bosom
a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the cracking of a whip was
good growled thenardier theyre going at a fine pace at such a
gallop the bourgeoise will be back inside three quarters of an hour
he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting
only five ruffians now remained in the den with thenardier and the
these men through the black masks or paste which covered their faces
and made of them at fears pleasure charcoal burners negroes or
demons had a stupid and gloomy air and it could be felt that they
perpetrated a crime like a bit of work tranquilly without either wrath
or mercy with a sort of ennui they were crowded together in one corner
the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity a sombre calm had
succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few
the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim
light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those
monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling
no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man
marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
who was this little one whom thenardier had called the lark was she
his ursule the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word
the lark and had replied in the most natural manner in the world
i do not know what you mean on the other hand the two letters u f
were explained they meant urbain fabre and ursule was no longer named
ursule this was what marius perceived most clearly of all
a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which
he was observing and commanding this whole scene there he stood
almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the
abominable things viewed at such close quarters he waited in the hope
of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect
his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
in any case he said if she is the lark i shall see her for the
thenardier woman is to bring her hither that will be the end and then
i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her
nearly half an hour passed in this manner thenardier seemed to be
absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir still marius
fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a
faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner
by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say it to you at once
these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation marius
my wife will be back shortly dont get impatient i think that the
lark really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you
should keep her only listen to me a bit my wife will go and hunt her
up with your letter i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did
so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her
they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind somewhere
outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses
your young lady will be taken to it she will alight from the fiacre
my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come
back here to tell us its done as for the young lady no harm will
be done to her the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be
quiet and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two
hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you if you have me
arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark thats
the prisoner uttered not a syllable after a pause thenardier
its very simple as you see therell be no harm done unless you wish
that there should be harm done im telling you how things stand i warn
he paused the prisoner did not break the silence and thenardier
as soon as my wife returns and says to me the lark is on the way we
will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home you see
terrible images passed through marius mind what that young girl whom
they were abducting was not to be brought back one of those monsters
was to bear her off into the darkness whither and what if it were she
it was clear that it was she marius felt his heart stop beating
what was he to do discharge the pistol place all those scoundrels in
the hands of justice but the horrible man with the meat axe would none
the less be out of reach with the young girl and marius reflected on
thenardiers words of which he perceived the bloody significance if
you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the
now it was not alone by the colonels testament it was by his own
love it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself
this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour
marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the
most heart breaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none
the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the
in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase
the prisoner made a movement in his bonds
he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact
rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes
and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously
the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and
nobody there rue saint dominique no 17 no monsieur urbain fabre
monsieur thenardier that old fellow has duped you you are too good
you see if it had been me id have chopped the beast in four quarters
to begin with and if he had acted ugly id have boiled him alive he
would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where
he keeps his shiners thats the way i should have managed matters
people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider
than women nobody at no 17 its nothing but a big carriage gate no
monsieur fabre in the rue saint dominique and after all that racing
and fee to the coachman and all i spoke to both the porter and the
portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him
she ursule or the lark he no longer knew what to call her was safe
while his exasperated wife vociferated thenardier had seated himself on
for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot
which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery
finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious
a false address what did you expect to gain by that
to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the
same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut the prisoner was
only attached to the bed now by one leg
before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward
he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the
brazier and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier
the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the
extremity of the hovel stared at him in stupefaction as almost free
and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot
the judicial examination to which the ambush in the gorbeau house
eventually gave rise established the fact that a large sou piece cut
and worked in a peculiar fashion was found in the garret when the
police made their descent on it this sou piece was one of those marvels
of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in
the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than
instruments of escape these hideous and delicate products of wonderful
art are to jewellers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry
there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys just as there are villons
in language the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means
sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handled knife
to saw a sou into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without
affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou
in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed
together and unscrewed at will it is a box in this box he hides a
watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized
chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess
merely a sou not at all he possesses liberty it was a large sou of
this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found
under the bed near the window they also found a tiny saw of blue steel
it is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the
moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal
it in his hand and that afterward having his right hand free he
unscrewed it and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him
which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements
as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he
had not cut the bonds of his left leg
the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise
be easy said bigrenaille to thenardier he still holds by one leg
and he cant get away ill answer for that i tied that paw for him
in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak
you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it
when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write
what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not
he stripped up his left sleeve and added
at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel
which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh
the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar
illustration red hot chisel 3b8 20 red hot chisel
marius reeled in utter horror the very ruffians shuddered hardly a
muscle of the old mans face contracted and while the red hot iron
sank into the smoking wound impassive and almost august he fixed on
thenardier his beautiful glance in which there was no hatred and where
with grand and lofty natures the revolts of the flesh and the senses
when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and
make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force
wretches said he have no more fear of me than i have for you
and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window
which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into
the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow
do what you please with me he was disarmed
two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked
man with the ventriloquists voice took up his station in front of him
ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement
at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition
but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy
there is only one thing left to do
it was the husband and wife taking counsel together
thenardier walked slowly towards the table opened the drawer and
took out the knife marius fretted with the handle of his pistol
unprecedented perplexity for the last hour he had had two voices in his
conscience the one enjoining him to respect his fathers testament the
other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued
uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony up to that
moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means
of reconciling these two duties but nothing within the limits of
however the peril was urgent the last bounds of delay had been
reached thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from
marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of
despair all at once a shudder ran through him
at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon
illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper on this
paper he read the following line written that very morning in large
letters by the eldest of the thenardier girls
an idea a flash crossed marius mind this was the expedient of which
he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was
torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim
he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of
paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper
round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of
it was high time thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last
the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster she handed it
pardie ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from
thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle
he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the
line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice
quick the ladder lets leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp
without cutting that mans throat asked the thenardier woman
through the window replied thenardier since ponine has thrown the
stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on
the mask with the ventriloquists voice deposited his huge key on the
floor raised both arms in the air and opened and clenched his fists
this was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on
the ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him in the
twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window and
solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks
the prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him he
as soon as the ladder was arranged thenardier cried
but just as he was about to throw his leg over bigrenaille seized him
not much come now you old dog after us
you are children said thenardier we are losing time the police are
well said the ruffians lets draw lots to see who shall go down
are you mad are you crazy what a pack of boobies you want to waste
time do you draw lots do you by a wet finger by a short straw with
would you like my hat cried a voice on the threshold
he had his hat in his hand and was holding it out to them with a smile
chapter xxi one should always begin by arresting the victims
at nightfall javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself
between the trees of the rue de la barrieredes gobelins which faced
the gorbeau house on the other side of the boulevard he had begun
operations by opening his pockets and dropping into it the two young
girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the
den but he had only caged azelma as for eponine she was not at her
post she had disappeared and he had not been able to seize her then
javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal
agreed upon the comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated
him at last he had grown impatient and sure that there was a nest
there sure of being in luck having recognized many of the ruffians
who had entered he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting
it will be remembered that he had marius pass key
he had arrived just in the nick of time
the terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had
abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight in less than a
second these seven men horrible to behold had grouped themselves in
an attitude of defence one with his meat axe another with his key
another with his bludgeon the rest with shears pincers and hammers
thenardier had his knife in his fist the thenardier woman snatched up
an enormous paving stone which lay in the angle of the window and served
illustration snatched up a paving stone 3b8 21 paving stone
javert put on his hat again and advanced a couple of paces into the
room with arms folded his cane under one arm his sword in its sheath
halt there said he you shall not go out by the window you shall go
through the door its less unhealthy there are seven of you there
are fifteen of us dont lets fall to collaring each other like men of
bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his
blouse and put it in thenardiers hand whispering in the latters
its javert i dont dare fire at that man do you dare
thenardier took the pistol and aimed at javert
javert who was only three paces from him stared intently at him and
thenardier pulled the trigger the pistol missed fire
youre the emperor of the fiends i surrender
and you javert asked the rest of the ruffians
thats right thats good i said so you are nice fellows
i only ask one thing said bigrenaille and that is that i may not
be denied tobacco while i am in confinement
a squad of policemen sword in hand and agents armed with bludgeons and
cudgels rushed in at javerts summons they pinioned the ruffians
this throng of men sparely lighted by the single candle filled the den
come on cried a voice which was not the voice of a man but of which
no one would ever have said it is a womans voice
the thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the
window and it was she who had just given vent to this roar
she had thrown off her shawl but retained her bonnet her husband who
was crouching behind her was almost hidden under the discarded
shawl and she was shielding him with her body as she elevated the
paving stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point
all crowded back towards the corridor a broad open space was cleared in
the thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed
themselves to be pinioned and muttered in hoarse and guttural
javert smiled and advanced across the open space which the thenardier
dont come near me she cried or ill crush you
what a grenadier ejaculated javert youve got a beard like a man
mother but i have claws like a woman
the thenardier dishevelled and terrible set her feet far apart threw
herself backwards and hurled the paving stone at javerts head javert
ducked the stone passed over him struck the wall behind knocked off a
huge piece of plastering and rebounding from angle to angle across the
hovel now luckily almost empty rested at javerts feet
at the same moment javert reached the thenardier couple one of his
big hands descended on the womans shoulder the other on the husbands
the policemen trooped in in force and in a few seconds javerts order
the thenardier female overwhelmed stared at her pinioned hands and
at those of her husband who had dropped to the floor and exclaimed
in the meanwhile the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep
the six pinioned ruffians were standing and still preserved their
spectral mien all three besmeared with black all three masked
and passing them in review with a glance of a frederick ii at a potsdam
parade he said to the three chimney builders
good day bigrenaille good day brujon good day deuxmilliards
then turning to the three masked men he said to the man with the
at that moment he caught sight of the ruffians prisoner who ever
since the entrance of the police had not uttered a word and had held
untie the gentleman said javert and let no one go out
that said he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table
where the candle and the writing materials still remained drew a
stamped paper from his pocket and began to prepare his report
when he had written the first lines which are formulas that never vary
