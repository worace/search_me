the police agent do you know his name
at that moment they heard the report of the pistol
jean valjean re appeared and cried it is done
chapter xx the dead are in the right and the living are not in the
the death agony of the barricade was about to begin
everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a
thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set
in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent
gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing
by squads and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth
of paris the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs
indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace
everywhere the tocsin of saint merry which now had the accents of a
sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with
sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the
for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue
de la chanvrerie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed
in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour
was come when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had
lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when
universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consented
to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the
bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear then the
inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was
the auxiliary of the combatant and the house fraternized with the
improvised fortress which rested on it when the situation was not
ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses
disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was
changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges
were nailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to
a people cannot be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than
it chooses woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand a people does not
let itself go at random then it abandons the insurrection to itself
the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague a house is an
escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall this wall hears
sees and will not it might open and save you no this wall is a judge
it gazes at you and condemns you what dismal things are closed houses
they seem dead they are living life which is as it were suspended
there persists there no one has gone out of them for four and twenty
hours but no one is missing from them in the interior of that rock
people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party
there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing fear
excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with it an
extenuating circumstance sometimes even and this has been actually
seen fear turns to passion fright may change into fury as prudence
does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates there
are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful
smoke what do these people want what have they come there to do
let them get out of the scrape so much the worse for them it is their
fault they are only getting what they deserve it does not concern
us here is our poor street all riddled with balls they are a pack of
rascals above all things dont open the door and the house assumes
the air of a tomb the insurgent is in the death throes in front of
that house he sees the grape shot and naked swords drawing near if
he cries he knows that they are listening to him and that no one will
come there stand walls which might protect him there are men who might
save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels
it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into
revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and
the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits
it it almost always comes too soon then it becomes resigned and
stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph it serves those who
deny it without complaint even excusing them and even disculpates
them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment it is
indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude
yes from the point of view of the human race
no from the point of view of the individual
progress is mans mode of existence the general life of the human race
is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called
progress progress advances it makes the great human and terrestrial
journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting
places where it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it
meditates in the presence of some splendid canaan suddenly unveiled
on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the
poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the
human soul and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken
god is dead perhaps said gerard de nerval one day to the writer of
these lines confounding progress with god and taking the interruption
he who despairs is in the wrong progress infallibly awakes and in
short we may say that it marches on even when it is asleep for it has
increased in size when we behold it erect once more we find it taller
to be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it does
on the stream erect no barriers cast in no boulders obstacles make
water froth and humanity boil hence arise troubles but after these
troubles we recognize the fact that ground has been gained until
order which is nothing else than universal peace has been established
until harmony and unity reign progress will have revolutions as its
what then is progress we have just enunciated it the permanent life
now it sometimes happens that the momentary life of individuals offers
resistance to the eternal life of the human race
let us admit without bitterness that the individual has his distinct
interests and can without forfeiture stipulate for his interest and
defend it the present has its pardonable dose of egotism momentary
life has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to
the future the generation which is passing in its turn over the earth
is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations its equal
after all who will have their turn later on i exist murmurs that
some one whose name is all i am young and in love i am old and i
wish to repose i am the father of a family i toil i prosper i am
successful in business i have houses to lease i have money in the
government funds i am happy i have a wife and children i have all
this i desire to live leave me in peace hence at certain hours a
profound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race
utopia moreover we must admit quits its radiant sphere when it makes
war it the truth of to morrow borrows its mode of procedure battle
from the lie of yesterday it the future behaves like the past it
pure idea becomes a deed of violence it complicates its heroism with
a violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer a
violence of occasion and expedient contrary to principle and for which
it is fatally punished the utopia insurrection fights with the old
military code in its fist it shoots spies it executes traitors it
suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness it makes
use of death a serious matter it seems as though utopia had no longer
any faith in radiance its irresistible and incorruptible force it
strikes with the sword now no sword is simple every blade has two
edges he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other
having made this reservation and made it with all severity it is
impossible for us not to admire whether they succeed or not those the
glorious combatants of the future the confessors of utopia even when
they miscarry they are worthy of veneration and it is perhaps in
failure that they possess the most majesty victory when it is in
accord with progress merits the applause of the people but a heroic
defeat merits their tender compassion the one is magnificent the other
sublime for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success john brown is
greater than washington and pisacane is greater than garibaldi
it certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the
we are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future when they
revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad every barricade seems
a crime their theories are incriminated their aim suspected their
ulterior motive is feared their conscience denounced they are
reproached with raising erecting and heaping up against the reigning
social state a mass of miseries of griefs of iniquities of wrongs
of despairs and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow
in order therein to embattle themselves and to combat people shout
to them you are tearing up the pavements of hell they might reply
that is because our barricade is made of good intentions
the best thing assuredly is the pacific solution in short let us
agree that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is
a good will which renders society uneasy but it depends on society
to save itself it is to its own good will that we make our appeal
no violent remedy is necessary to study evil amiably to prove its
existence then to cure it it is to this that we invite it
however that may be even when fallen above all when fallen these men
who at every point of the universe with their eyes fixed on france are
striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal
are august they give their life a free offering to progress they
accomplish the will of providence they perform a religious act at the
appointed hour with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answers
to his cue in obedience to the divine stage manager they enter the
tomb and this hopeless combat this stoical disappearance they accept
in order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences the
magnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the 14th of july
1789 these soldiers are priests the french revolution is an act of
moreover there are and it is proper to add this distinction to the
distinctions already pointed out in another chapter there are accepted
revolutions revolutions which are called revolutions there are refused
an insurrection which breaks out is an idea which is passing its
examination before the people if the people lets fall a black ball the
idea is dried fruit the insurrection is a mere skirmish
waging war at every summons and every time that utopia desires it is
not the thing for the peoples nations have not always and at every hour
they are positive a priori insurrection is repugnant to them in the
first place because it often results in a catastrophe in the second
place because it always has an abstraction as its point of departure
because and this is a noble thing it is always for the ideal and for
the ideal alone that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice
themselves an insurrection is an enthusiasm enthusiasm may wax wroth
hence the appeal to arms but every insurrection which aims at a
government or a regime aims higher thus for instance and we
insist upon it what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832 and in
particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chanvrerie were
combating was not precisely louis philippe the majority of them
when talking freely did justice to this king who stood midway between
monarchy and revolution no one hated him but they attacked the younger
branch of the divine right in louis philippe as they had attacked its
elder branch in charles x and that which they wished to overturn in
overturning royalty in france was as we have explained the usurpation
of man over man and of privilege over right in the entire universe
paris without a king has as result the world without despots this is
the manner in which they reasoned their aim was distant no doubt
vague perhaps and it retreated in the face of their efforts but it was
thus it is and we sacrifice ourselves for these visions which are
almost always illusions for the sacrificed but illusions with which
after all the whole of human certainty is mingled we throw ourselves
into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are
about to do who knows we may succeed we are few in number we have a
whole army arrayed against us but we are defending right the natural
law the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication
is possible justice and truth and in case of need we die like the
three hundred spartans we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas
and we march straight before us and once pledged we do not draw
back and we rush onwards with head held low cherishing as our hope an
unprecedented victory revolution completed progress set free again
the aggrandizement of the human race universal deliverance and in the
these passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck
and we have just explained why the crowd is restive in the presence of
the impulses of paladins heavy masses the multitudes which are fragile
because of their very weight fear adventures and there is a touch of
moreover and we must not forget this interests which are not very
friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way sometimes the
the grandeur and beauty of france lies in this that she takes less from
the stomach than other nations she more easily knots the rope about her
loins she is the first awake the last asleep she marches forwards
this arises from the fact that she is an artist
the ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic the same as the
beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true artistic peoples are
also consistent peoples to love beauty is to see the light that is why
the torch of europe that is to say of civilization was first borne by
greece who passed it on to italy who handed it on to france divine
it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of
its progress the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity
of imagination only a civilizing people should remain a manly people
corinth yes sybaris no whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a
bastard he must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso but he must be
artistic in the matter of civilization he must not refine but he must
sublime on this condition one gives to the human race the pattern of
the modern ideal has its type in art and its means is science it is
through science that it will realize that august vision of the poets
the socially beautiful eden will be reconstructed by ab at the point
which civilization has now reached the exact is a necessary element
of the splendid and the artistic sentiment is not only served but
completed by the scientific organ dreams must be calculated art which
is the conqueror should have for support science which is the walker
the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance the
modern spirit is the genius of greece with the genius of india as its
races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to
guide civilization genuflection before the idol or before money wastes
away the muscles which walk and the will which advances hieratic or
mercantile absorption lessens a peoples power of radiance lowers its
horizon by lowering its level and deprives it of that intelligence
at once both human and divine of the universal goal which makes
missionaries of nations babylon has no ideal carthage has no ideal
athens and rome have and keep throughout all the nocturnal darkness of
france is in the same quality of race as greece and italy she is
athenian in the matter of beauty and roman in her greatness moreover
she is good she gives herself oftener than is the case with other
races is she in the humor for self devotion and sacrifice only this
humor seizes upon her and again abandons her and therein lies the
great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk or who walk
on when she desires to halt france has her relapses into materialism
and at certain instants the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain
have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and are of the
dimensions of a missouri or a south carolina what is to be done in
such a case the giantess plays at being a dwarf immense france has her
to this there is nothing to say peoples like planets possess the
right to an eclipse and all is well provided that the light
returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night dawn and
resurrection are synonymous the reappearance of the light is identical
let us state these facts calmly death on the barricade or the tomb in
exile is an acceptable occasion for devotion the real name of
devotion is disinterestedness let the abandoned allow themselves to
be abandoned let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled and let us
confine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far
when they do retreat one must not push too far in descent under pretext
matter exists the minute exists interest exists the stomach exists
but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom the life of the moment has
its rights we admit but permanent life has its rights also alas the
fact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall this can be seen in
history more frequently than is desirable a nation is great it tastes
the ideal then it bites the mire and finds it good and if it be asked
how it happens that it has abandoned socrates for falstaff it replies
one word more before returning to our subject the conflict
a battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else
than a convulsion towards the ideal progress trammelled is sickly and
is subject to these tragic epilepsies with that malady of progress
civil war we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage this
is one of the fatal phases at once act and entracte of that drama
whose pivot is a social condemnation and whose veritable title is
the cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought and
at the point of this drama which we have now reached the idea which it
contains having still more than one trial to undergo it is perhaps
permitted to us if not to lift the veil from it to at least allow its
the book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is from
one end to the other as a whole and in detail whatever may be its
intermittences exceptions and faults the march from evil to good from
the unjust to the just from night to day from appetite to conscience
from rottenness to life from hell to heaven from nothingness to god
point of departure matter point of arrival the soul the hydra at the
all at once the drum beat the charge
the attack was a hurricane on the evening before in the darkness
the barricade had been approached silently as by a boa now in broad
daylight in that widening street surprise was decidedly impossible
rude force had moreover been unmasked the cannon had begun the
roar the army hurled itself on the barricade fury now became skill
a powerful detachment of infantry of the line broken at regular
intervals by the national guard and the municipal guard on foot
and supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen
debauched into the street at a run with drums beating trumpets
braying bayonets levelled the sappers at their head and
imperturbable under the projectiles charged straight for the barricade
with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall
the insurgents fired impetuously the barricade once scaled had a mane
of lightning flashes the assault was so furious that for one moment
it was inundated with assailants but it shook off the soldiers as the
lion shakes off the dogs and it was only covered with besiegers as
the cliff is covered with foam to re appear a moment later beetling
the column forced to retreat remained massed in the street
unprotected but terrible and replied to the redoubt with a terrible
discharge of musketry any one who has seen fireworks will recall the
sheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet let
the reader picture to himself this bouquet no longer vertical but
horizontal bearing a bullet buck shot or a biscaien at the tip of each
one of its jets of flame and picking off dead men one after another
from its clusters of lightning the barricade was underneath it
on both sides the resolution was equal the bravery exhibited there
was almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity
this was the epoch when a national guardsman fought like a zouave
the troop wished to make an end of it insurrection was desirous of
fighting the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and
in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy in this fray each
one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour the street was
the barricade had enjolras at one of its extremities and marius at the
other enjolras who carried the whole barricade in his head reserved
and sheltered himself three soldiers fell one after the other under
his embrasure without having even seen him marius fought unprotected
he made himself a target he stood with more than half his body above
the breastworks there is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious
man who takes the bit in his teeth there is no man more terrible in
action than a dreamer marius was formidable and pensive in battle he
was as in a dream one would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in
the insurgents cartridges were giving out but not their sarcasms in
this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood they laughed
what have you done with your hat bossuet asked him
they have finally taken it away from me with cannon balls
can any one understand exclaimed feuilly bitterly those men and
he cited names well known names even celebrated names some belonging
to the old army who had promised to join us and taken an oath to aid
us and who had pledged their honor to it and who are our generals and
and combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile
there are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the
the interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that
one would have said that there had been a snowstorm
the assailants had numbers in their favor the insurgents had position
they were at the top of a wall and they thundered point blank upon
the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in
the escarpment this barricade constructed as it was and admirably
buttressed was really one of those situations where a handful of men
hold a legion in check nevertheless the attacking column constantly
recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets drew inexorably
nearer and now little by little step by step but surely the army
closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine press
one assault followed another the horror of the situation kept
then there burst forth on that heap of paving stones in that rue de la
chanvrerie a battle worthy of a wall of troy these haggard ragged
exhausted men who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours who
had not slept who had but a few more rounds to fire who were fumbling
in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges nearly all
of whom were wounded with head or arm bandaged with black and
blood stained linen with holes in their clothes from which the blood
trickled and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords
became titans the barricade was ten times attacked approached
in order to form an idea of this struggle it is necessary to imagine
fire set to a throng of terrible courages and then to gaze at the
conflagration it was not a combat it was the interior of a furnace
there mouths breathed the flame there countenances were extraordinary
the human form seemed impossible there the combatants flamed forth
there and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red
the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we
renounce all attempts at depicting the epic alone has the right to fill
one would have pronounced this that hell of brahmanism the most
redoubtable of the seventeen abysses which the veda calls the forest of
they fought hand to hand foot to foot with pistol shots with blows of
the sword with their fists at a distance close at hand from above
from below from everywhere from the roofs of the houses from the
windows of the wine shop from the cellar windows whither some had
the facade of corinthe half demolished was hideous the window
tattooed with grape shot had lost glass and frame and was nothing now
but a shapeless hole tumultuously blocked with paving stones
bossuet was killed feuilly was killed courfeyrac was killed
combeferre transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at
the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier had only time to
cast a glance to heaven when he expired
marius still fighting was so riddled with wounds particularly in the
head that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood and one would
have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief
enjolras alone was not struck when he had no longer any weapon he
reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm
or other into his fist all he had left was the stumps of four swords

breathe upon them with a breath of duty place them face to face in the
carrefour boucherat or in the blind alley planche mibray and let the
one fight for his flag and the other for his ideal and let both of
them imagine that they are fighting for their country the struggle will
be colossal and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones
in conflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanity
is striving will equal the shadow cast by megaryon king of lycia
tiger filled crushing in his embrace the immense body of ajax equal to
when there were no longer any of the leaders left alive except enjolras
and marius at the two extremities of the barricade the centre which
had so long sustained courfeyrac joly bossuet feuilly and combeferre
gave way the cannon though it had not effected a practicable breach
had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt there the
summit of the wall had disappeared before the balls and had crumbled
away and the rubbish which had fallen now inside now outside had
as it accumulated formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two
sides of the barrier one on the inside the other on the outside the
exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack
a final assault was there attempted and this assault succeeded the
mass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run came up with
irresistible force and the serried front of battle of the attacking
column made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the
battlements this time it was decisive the group of insurgents who
then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them many
finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns did not
wish to die this is a moment when the instinct of self preservation
emits howls when the beast re appears in men they were hemmed in by
the lofty six story house which formed the background of their redoubt
this house might prove their salvation the building was barricaded and
walled as it were from top to bottom before the troops of the line
had reached the interior of the redoubt there was time for a door to
open and shut the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for
that and the door of that house suddenly opened a crack and closed
again instantly was life for these despairing men behind this house
there were streets possible flight space they set to knocking at that
door with the butts of their guns and with kicks shouting calling
entreating wringing their hands no one opened from the little window
on the third floor the head of the dead man gazed down upon them
but enjolras and marius and the seven or eight rallied about them
sprang forward and protected them enjolras had shouted to the soldiers
dont advance and as an officer had not obeyed enjolras had killed
the officer he was now in the little inner court of the redoubt with
his back planted against the corinthe building a sword in one hand
a rifle in the other holding open the door of the wine shop which he
barred against assailants he shouted to the desperate men there is
but one door open this one and shielding them with his body and
facing an entire battalion alone he made them pass in behind him all
precipitated themselves thither enjolras executing with his rifle
which he now used like a cane what single stick players call a covered
rose round his head levelled the bayonets around and in front of him
and was the last to enter and then ensued a horrible moment when the
soldiers tried to make their way in and the insurgents strove to bar
them out the door was slammed with such violence that as it fell back
into its frame it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been
clinging to it cut off and glued to the post
marius remained outside a shot had just broken his collar bone he
felt that he was fainting and falling at that moment with eyes already
shut he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him and the swoon
in which his senses vanished hardly allowed him time for the thought
mingled with a last memory of cosette i am taken prisoner i shall be
enjolras not seeing marius among those who had taken refuge in the
wine shop had the same idea but they had reached a moment when each
man has not the time to meditate on his own death enjolras fixed the
bar across the door and bolted it and double locked it with key and
chain while those outside were battering furiously at it the soldiers
with the butts of their muskets the sappers with their axes the
assailants were grouped about that door the siege of the wine shop was
the soldiers we will observe were full of wrath
the death of the artillery sergeant had enraged them and then a still
more melancholy circumstance during the few hours which had preceded
the attack it had been reported among them that the insurgents were
mutilating their prisoners and that there was the headless body of
a soldier in the wine shop this sort of fatal rumor is the usual
accompaniment of civil wars and it was a false report of this kind
which later on produced the catastrophe of the rue transnonain
when the door was barricaded enjolras said to the others
then he approached the table on which lay mabeuf and gavroche beneath
the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible one large
the other small and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the
cold folds of the shroud a hand projected from beneath the winding
sheet and hung near the floor it was that of the old man
enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand just as he had kissed
these were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of
let us abridge the tale the barricade had fought like a gate of thebes
the wine shop fought like a house of saragossa these resistances are
dogged no quarter no flag of truce possible men are willing to die
when suchet says capitulate palafox replies after the war with
cannon the war with knives nothing was lacking in the capture by
assault of the hucheloup wine shop neither paving stones raining from
the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers
by crushing them horribly nor shots fired from the attic windows and
the cellar nor the fury of attack nor finally when the door yielded
the frenzied madness of extermination the assailants rushing into the
wine shop their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been
beaten in and flung on the ground found not a single combatant there
the spiral staircase hewn asunder with the axe lay in the middle of
the tap room a few wounded men were just breathing their last every
one who was not killed was on the first floor and from there through
the hole in the ceiling which had formed the entrance of the stairs
a terrific fire burst forth it was the last of their cartridges when
they were exhausted when these formidable men on the point of death had
no longer either powder or ball each grasped in his hands two of the
bottles which enjolras had reserved and of which we have spoken and
held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs
we relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred the
besieged man alas converts everything into a weapon greek fire did
not disgrace archimedes boiling pitch did not disgrace bayard all war
is a thing of terror and there is no choice in it the musketry of the
besiegers though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below
upwards was deadly the rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily
surrounded by heads of the slain whence dripped long red and smoking
streams the uproar was indescribable a close and burning smoke almost
produced night over this combat words are lacking to express horror
when it has reached this pitch there were no longer men in this
conflict which was now infernal they were no longer giants matched
with colossi it resembled milton and dante rather than homer demons
at length by dint of mounting on each others backs aiding themselves
with the skeleton of the staircase climbing up the walls clinging to
the ceiling slashing away at the very brink of the trap door the last
one who offered resistance a score of assailants soldiers national
guardsmen municipal guardsmen in utter confusion the majority
disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded
by blood furious rendered savage made an irruption into the apartment
on the first floor there they found only one man still on his feet
enjolras without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand
now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head
of those who were entering he had placed the billiard table between his
assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room
and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a
weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an
he is the leader it was he who slew the artillery man it is well that
he has placed himself there let him remain there let us shoot him down
and flinging away his bit of gun barrel and folding his arms he
the audacity of a fine death always affects men as soon as enjolras
folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased in
the room and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral
solemnity the menacing majesty of enjolras disarmed and motionless
appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man haughty bloody
and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an
invulnerable being seemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to
constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully his beauty at
that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh
and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed
as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded it was of him
possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of
war there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo a national
guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras lowered his gun saying it
seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower
twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras and
do you wish to have your eyes bandaged
was it you who killed the artillery sergeant
grantaire had waked up a few moments before
grantaire it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the
preceding evening in the upper room of the wine shop seated on a chair
he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk the
hideous potion of absinthe porter and alcohol had thrown him into a
lethargy his table being small and not suitable for the barricade
he had been left in possession of it he was still in the same posture
with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms
surrounded by glasses beer jugs and bottles his was the overwhelming
slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech nothing had had any
effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the cannon balls nor the
grape shot which had made its way through the window into the room where
he was nor the tremendous uproar of the assault he merely replied to
the cannonade now and then by a snore he seemed to be waiting there
for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking many corpses
were strewn around him and at the first glance there was nothing to
distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death
noise does not rouse a drunken man silence awakens him the fall
of everything around him only augmented grantaires prostration the
crumbling of all things was his lullaby the sort of halt which the
tumult underwent in the presence of enjolras was a shock to this heavy
slumber it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which
suddenly comes to a dead stop the persons dozing within it wake up
grantaire rose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed
a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn
away one beholds at a single glance and as a whole all that it has
concealed all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard
who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last
twenty four hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly
informed ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration
of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is
dissipated and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity
relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the
billiard table the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on enjolras had not
even noticed grantaire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his
order take aim when all at once they heard a strong voice shout
long live the republic im one of them
grantaire had risen the immense gleam of the whole combat which he
had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant
he repeated long live the republic crossed the room with a firm
stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside enjolras
finish both of us at one blow said he
and turning gently to enjolras he said to him
this smile was not ended when the report resounded
enjolras pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall
as though the balls had nailed him there only his head was bowed
grantaire fell at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt
a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last remaining
insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house they fired
into the attic through a wooden lattice they fought under the very
roof they flung bodies some of them still alive out through the
windows two light infantrymen who tried to lift the shattered omnibus
were slain by two shots fired from the attic a man in a blouse was
flung down from it with a bayonet wound in the abdomen and breathed
his last on the ground a soldier and an insurgent slipped together
on the sloping slates of the roof and as they would not release each
other they fell clasped in a ferocious embrace a similar conflict
went on in the cellar shouts shots a fierce trampling then silence
the soldiers began to search the houses round about and to pursue the
the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt
at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean
jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose
himself in it had it not been for him no one in that supreme phase
of agony would have thought of the wounded thanks to him everywhere
present in the carnage like a providence those who fell were picked
up transported to the tap room and cared for in the intervals he
reappeared on the barricade but nothing which could resemble a blow
an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands he held his
peace and lent succor moreover he had received only a few scratches
the bullets would have none of him if suicide formed part of what he
had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that spot he had
not succeeded but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide an
jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see
marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter when
a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the agility of
a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off
the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violently
concentrated upon enjolras and upon the door of the wine shop that
no one saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting marius in his arms
traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the
the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the
street it afforded shelter from the bullets the grape shot and all
eyes and a few square feet of space there is sometimes a chamber
which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration and in the midst of
raging seas beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley
of shoals a tranquil nook it was in this sort of fold in the interior
trapezium of the barricade that eponine had breathed her last
there jean valjean halted let marius slide to the ground placed his
back against the wall and cast his eyes about him
for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a
shelter but how was he to escape from this massacre he recalled the
anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before
and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult
then to day it was impossible he had before him that deaf and
implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited
only by a dead man leaning out of his window he had on his right the
rather low barricade which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie
to pass this obstacle seemed easy but beyond the crest of the barrier a
line of bayonets was visible the troops of the line were posted on the
watch behind that barricade it was evident that to pass the barricade
was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon and that any head which
should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of
stones would serve as a target for sixty shots on his left he had the
field of battle death lurked round the corner of that wall
only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament
and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient
to come to some decision fighting was going on a few paces away
fortunately all were raging around a single point the door of the
wine shop but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier
to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was
jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at
one side of him then he looked at the ground with the violence of the
last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce
by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began
to assume form and outline at his feet as though it had been a power
of glance which made the thing desired unfold a few paces distant he
perceived at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and
watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of paving stones
which partly concealed it an iron grating placed flat and on a level
with the soil this grating made of stout transverse bars was about
two feet square the frame of paving stones which supported it had been
torn up and it was as it were unfastened
through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture something like
the flue of a chimney or the pipe of a cistern jean valjean darted
forward his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who
was as inert as a dead body upon his shoulders to descend with this
burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that
sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon
which the loosened stones rolled down afresh fall into its place behind
him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the
surface all this was executed like that which one does in dreams with
the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle this took only a
jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a
the impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the
wall into the convent recurred to him only what he was carrying to day
was not cosette it was marius he could barely hear the formidable
tumult in the wine shop taken by assault like a vague murmur overhead
chapter i the land impoverished by the sea
paris casts twenty five millions yearly into the water and this without
metaphor how and in what manner day and night with what object with
no object with what intention with no intention why for no
reason by means of what organ by means of its intestine what is its
twenty five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the
valuations of special science have set upon it
science after having long groped about now knows that the most
fecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure
the chinese let us confess it to our shame knew it before us not
a chinese peasant it is eckberg who says this goes to town without
bringing back with him at the two extremities of his bamboo pole two
full buckets of what we designate as filth thanks to human dung the
earth in china is still as young as in the days of abraham chinese
wheat yields a hundred fold of the seed there is no guano comparable
