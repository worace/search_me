stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit
of clothes showing them how the patriot barsad was a hired spy and
traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas which he certainly did look
rather like how the virtuous servant cly was his friend and partner
and was worthy to be how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family
affairs in france he being of french extraction did require his making
those passages across the channel though what those affairs were a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him
even for his life to disclose how the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together with the exception of that
reference to george washington which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke
how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears and therefore mr attorney general had made the most of it
how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the
state trials of this country were full but there my lord interposed
with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions
mr stryver then called his few witnesses and mr cruncher had next to
attend while mr attorney general turned the whole suit of clothes mr
stryver had fitted on the jury inside out showing how barsad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the
prisoner a hundred times worse lastly came my lord himself turning
the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave clothes for the prisoner
and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again
mr carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court
changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement
while his learned friend mr stryver massing his papers before him
whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury while all the spectators moved more or less and
grouped themselves anew while even my lord himself arose from his seat
and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish this one man
sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his
hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him
a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness
when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the
lookers on taking note of him now said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike mr cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour and added id hold half a guinea
that he dont get no law work to do dont look like the sort of one
yet this mr carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in for now when miss manettes head dropped upon
her fathers breast he was the first to see it and to say audibly
officer look to that young lady help the gentleman to take her out
there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much
sympathy with her father it had evidently been a great distress to
him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled he had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud
ever since as he passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a
they were not agreed and wished to retire my lord perhaps with george
washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward
and retired himself the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted it began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while the spectators dropped off to get
refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat
mr lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out
now reappeared and beckoned to jerry who in the slackened interest
jerry if you wish to take something to eat you can but keep in the
way you will be sure to hear when the jury come in dont be a moment
behind them for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank you
are the quickest messenger i know and will get to temple bar long
jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling mr carton came up
at the moment and touched mr lorry on the arm
she is greatly distressed but her father is comforting her and she
feels the better for being out of court
ill tell the prisoner so it wont do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you to be seen speaking to him publicly you know
mr lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind and mr carton made his way to the outside of the bar
the way out of court lay in that direction and jerry followed him all
you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness miss manette she
will do very well you have seen the worst of her agitation
i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it could you tell her so
yes i could i will if you ask it
mr cartons manner was so careless as to be almost insolent he stood
half turned from the prisoner lounging with his elbow against the bar
i do ask it accept my cordial thanks
what said carton still only half turned towards him do you expect
its the wisest thing to expect and the likeliest but i think their
loitering on the way out of court not being allowed jerry heard no
more but left them so like each other in feature so unlike each other
in manner standing side by side both reflected in the glass above
an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief and rascal crowded
passages below even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale
the hoarse messenger uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection had dropped into a doze when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court carried him along
jerry jerry mr lorry was already calling at the door when he got
here sir its a fight to get back again here i am sir
mr lorry handed him a paper through the throng quick have you got
hastily written on the paper was the word acquitted
if you had sent the message recalled to life again muttered
jerry as he turned i should have known what you meant this time
he had no opportunity of saying or so much as thinking anything else
until he was clear of the old bailey for the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue flies were dispersing in
from the dimly lighted passages of the court the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day was straining off when
doctor manette lucie manette his daughter mr lorry the solicitor
for the defence and its counsel mr stryver stood gathered round mr
charles darnay just released congratulating him on his escape from
it would have been difficult by a far brighter light to recognise
in doctor manette intellectual of face and upright of bearing the
shoemaker of the garret in paris yet no one could have looked at him
twice without looking again even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully without any apparent
reason while one external cause and that a reference to his long
lingering agony would always as on the trial evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul it was also in its nature to arise of
itself and to draw a gloom over him as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun when the substance was three
only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his
misery and to a present beyond his misery and the sound of her voice
the light of her face the touch of her hand had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always not absolutely always for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed but they were few
mr darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully and had turned
to mr stryver whom he warmly thanked mr stryver a man of little
more than thirty but looking twenty years older than he was stout
loud red bluff and free from any drawback of delicacy had a pushing
way of shouldering himself morally and physically into companies and
conversations that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life
he still had his wig and gown on and he said squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr lorry clean
out of the group i am glad to have brought you off with honour mr
darnay it was an infamous prosecution grossly infamous but not the
you have laid me under an obligation to you for life in two senses
i have done my best for you mr darnay and my best is as good as
it clearly being incumbent on some one to say much better mr lorry
said it perhaps not quite disinterestedly but with the interested
you think so said mr stryver well you have been present all day
and you ought to know you are a man of business too
and as such quoth mr lorry whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it as such i will appeal to doctor manette to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes miss lucie looks ill mr
darnay has had a terrible day we are worn out
speak for yourself mr lorry said stryver i have a nights work to
i speak for myself answered mr lorry and for mr darnay and for
miss lucie and miss lucie do you not think i may speak for us all
he asked her the question pointedly and with a glance at her father
his face had become frozen as it were in a very curious look at
darnay an intent look deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust
not even unmixed with fear with this strange expression on him his
my father said lucie softly laying her hand on his
he slowly shook the shadow off and turned to her
the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed under the
impression which he himself had originated that he would not be
released that night the lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle
and the dismal place was deserted until to morrow mornings interest of
gallows pillory whipping post and branding iron should repeople it
walking between her father and mr darnay lucie manette passed into
the open air a hackney coach was called and the father and daughter
mr stryver had left them in the passages to shoulder his way back
to the robing room another person who had not joined the group or
interchanged a word with any one of them but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest had silently strolled
out after the rest and had looked on until the coach drove away he now
stepped up to where mr lorry and mr darnay stood upon the pavement
so mr lorry men of business may speak to mr darnay now
nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr cartons part in the days
proceedings nobody had known of it he was unrobed and was none the
if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind when the
business mind is divided between good natured impulse and business
mr lorry reddened and said warmly you have mentioned that before
sir we men of business who serve a house are not our own masters we
have to think of the house more than ourselves
i know i know rejoined mr carton carelessly dont be
nettled mr lorry you are as good as another i have no doubt better
and indeed sir pursued mr lorry not minding him i really dont
know what you have to do with the matter if youll excuse me as very
much your elder for saying so i really dont know that it is your
business bless you i have no business said mr carton
it is a pity you have not sir
if you had pursued mr lorry perhaps you would attend to it
lord love you no i shouldnt said mr carton
well sir cried mr lorry thoroughly heated by his indifference
business is a very good thing and a very respectable thing and sir
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments mr
darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance mr darnay good night god bless you sir
i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
perhaps a little angry with himself as well as with the barrister mr
lorry bustled into the chair and was carried off to tellsons carton
who smelt of port wine and did not appear to be quite sober laughed
this is a strange chance that throws you and me together this must
be a strange night to you standing alone here with your counterpart on
i hardly seem yet returned charles darnay to belong to this world
i dont wonder at it its not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another you speak faintly
then why the devil dont you dine i dined myself while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to this or
some other let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at
drawing his arm through his own he took him down ludgate hill to
fleet street and so up a covered way into a tavern here they were
shown into a little room where charles darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine while carton sat
opposite to him at the same table with his separate bottle of port
before him and his fully half insolent manner upon him
do you feel yet that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again mr
i am frightfully confused regarding time and place but i am so far
he said it bitterly and filled up his glass again which was a large
as to me the greatest desire i have is to forget that i belong to it
it has no good in it for me except wine like this nor i for it so we
are not much alike in that particular indeed i begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular you and i
confused by the emotion of the day and feeling his being there with
this double of coarse deportment to be like a dream charles darnay was
at a loss how to answer finally answered not at all
now your dinner is done carton presently said why dont you call a
health mr darnay why dont you give your toast
why its on the tip of your tongue it ought to be it must be ill
looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall where it shivered to
pieces then rang the bell and ordered in another
thats a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark mr darnay
a slight frown and a laconic yes were the answer
thats a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by how does it
feel is it worth being tried for ones life to be the object of such
she was mightily pleased to have your message when i gave it her not
that she showed she was pleased but i suppose she was
the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this
disagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him in the
strait of the day he turned the dialogue to that point and thanked him
i neither want any thanks nor merit any was the careless rejoinder
it was nothing to do in the first place and i dont know why i did
it in the second mr darnay let me ask you a question
willingly and a small return for your good offices
really mr carton returned the other oddly disconcerted i have
you have acted as if you do but i dont think you do
i dont think i do said carton i begin to have a very good
nevertheless pursued darnay rising to ring the bell there is
nothing in that i hope to prevent my calling the reckoning and our
carton rejoining nothing in life darnay rang do you call the whole
reckoning said carton on his answering in the affirmative then
bring me another pint of this same wine drawer and come and wake me at
the bill being paid charles darnay rose and wished him good night
without returning the wish carton rose too with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner and said a last word mr darnay you think
i think you have been drinking mr carton
since i must say so i know it
then you shall likewise know why i am a disappointed drudge sir i
care for no man on earth and no man on earth cares for me
much to be regretted you might have used your talents better
may be so mr darnay may be not dont let your sober face elate you
however you dont know what it may come to good night
when he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went to a
glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely in it
do you particularly like the man he muttered at his own image why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you there is nothing
in you to like you know that ah confound you what a change you have
made in yourself a good reason for taking to a man that he shows you
what you have fallen away from and what you might have been change
places with him and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was and commiserated by that agitated face as he was come on and
have it out in plain words you hate the fellow
he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation drank it all in a few
minutes and fell asleep on his arms with his hair straggling over the
table and a long winding sheet in the candle dripping down upon him
those were drinking days and most men drank hard so very great is
the improvement time has brought about in such habits that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman would seem in these days a ridiculous exaggeration
the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities neither was mr
stryver already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice behind his compeers in this particular any more than in the
a favourite at the old bailey and eke at the sessions mr stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite
specially to their longing arms and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the lord chief justice in the court of kings bench the
florid countenance of mr stryver might be daily seen bursting out of
the bed of wigs like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden full of flaring companions
it had once been noted at the bar that while mr stryver was a glib
man and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments
but a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this the more
business he got the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney
carton he always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning
sydney carton idlest and most unpromising of men was stryvers great
ally what the two drank together between hilary term and michaelmas
might have floated a kings ship stryver never had a case in hand
anywhere but carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring
at the ceiling of the court they went the same circuit and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings like a dissipated cat at last it began to get about
among such as were interested in the matter that although sydney carton
would never be a lion he was an amazingly good jackal and that he
rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity
ten oclock sir said the man at the tavern whom he had charged to
what do you mean ten oclock at night
yes sir your honour told me to call you
after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes
he got up tossed his hat on and walked out he turned into the temple
and having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of kings
bench walk and paper buildings turned into the stryver chambers
the stryver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gone
home and the stryver principal opened the door he had his slippers on
and a loose bed gown and his throat was bare for his greater ease he
had that rather wild strained seared marking about the eyes which
may be observed in all free livers of his class from the portrait of
jeffries downward and which can be traced under various disguises of
art through the portraits of every drinking age
you are a little late memory said stryver
about the usual time it may be a quarter of an hour later
they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers
where there was a blazing fire a kettle steamed upon the hob and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone with plenty of wine upon
it and brandy and rum and sugar and lemons
you have had your bottle i perceive sydney
two to night i think i have been dining with the days client or
that was a rare point sydney that you brought to bear upon the
identification how did you come by it when did it strike you
i thought he was rather a handsome fellow and i thought i should have
been much the same sort of fellow if i had had any luck
mr stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch
you and your luck sydney get to work get to work
sullenly enough the jackal loosened his dress went into an adjoining
room and came back with a large jug of cold water a basin and a towel
or two steeping the towels in the water and partially wringing them
out he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold sat down
at the table and said now i am ready
not much boiling down to be done to night memory said mr stryver
the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking table while the jackal sat at his own paper bestrewn table
proper on the other side of it with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand both resorted to the drinking table without stint but each in
a different way the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband looking at the fire or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document the jackal with knitted brows and intent face
so deep in his task that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass which often groped about for a minute or
more before it found the glass for his lips two or three times the
matter in hand became so knotty that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up and steep his towels anew from these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion and
proceeded to offer it to him the lion took it with care and caution
made his selections from it and his remarks upon it and the jackal
assisted both when the repast was fully discussed the lion put his
hands in his waistband again and lay down to meditate the jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle and a fresh application
to his head and applied himself to the collection of a second meal
this was administered to the lion in the same manner and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning
and now we have done sydney fill a bumper of punch said mr
the jackal removed the towels from his head which had been steaming
you were very sound sydney in the matter of those crown witnesses
i dont gainsay it what has roughened your temper put some punch to
with a deprecatory grunt the jackal again complied
the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school said stryver nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past the
old seesaw sydney up one minute and down the next now in spirits and
ah returned the other sighing yes the same sydney with the same
luck even then i did exercises for other boys and seldom did my own
god knows it was my way i suppose
he sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
carton said his friend squaring himself at him with a bullying air
as if the fire grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney
carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it your way
is and always was a lame way you summon no energy and purpose look
oh botheration returned sydney with a lighter and more
how have i done what i have done said stryver how do i do what i
partly through paying me to help you i suppose but its not worth
your while to apostrophise me or the air about it what you want to
do you do you were always in the front rank and i was always behind
i had to get into the front rank i was not born there was i
i was not present at the ceremony but my opinion is you were said
carton at this he laughed again and they both laughed
before shrewsbury and at shrewsbury and ever since shrewsbury
pursued carton you have fallen into your rank and i have fallen into
mine even when we were fellow students in the student quarter of paris
picking up french and french law and other french crumbs that we
didnt get much good of you were always somewhere and i was always
upon my soul i am not sure that it was not yours you were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing to that restless degree
that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose its a gloomy
thing however to talk about ones own past with the day breaking
turn me in some other direction before i go
well then pledge me to the pretty witness said stryver holding up
his glass are you turned in a pleasant direction
pretty witness he muttered looking down into his glass i have had
enough of witnesses to day and to night whos your pretty witness
why man alive she was the admiration of the whole court
rot the admiration of the whole court who made the old bailey a judge
of beauty she was a golden haired doll
do you know sydney said mr stryver looking at him with sharp eyes
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face do you know i rather
thought at the time that you sympathised with the golden haired doll
and were quick to see what happened to the golden haired doll
quick to see what happened if a girl doll or no doll swoons within a
yard or two of a mans nose he can see it without a perspective glass
i pledge you but i deny the beauty and now ill have no more drink
when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle to light
him down the stairs the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows when he got out of the house the air was cold and sad the
dull sky overcast the river dark and dim the whole scene like a
lifeless desert and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast as if the desert sand had risen far away and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city
waste forces within him and a desert all around this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace and saw for a moment lying in the
wilderness before him a mirage of honourable ambition self denial and
perseverance in the fair city of this vision there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening waters of hope that sparkled in his sight
a moment and it was gone climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed and its
sadly sadly the sun rose it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions incapable of their directed exercise
incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible of the blight
on him and resigning himself to let it eat him away
the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street corner not
far from soho square on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason and carried
it as to the public interest and memory far out to sea mr jarvis
lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived
on his way to dine with the doctor after several relapses into
business absorption mr lorry had become the doctors friend and the
quiet street corner was the sunny part of his life
on this certain fine sunday mr lorry walked towards soho early in
the afternoon for three reasons of habit firstly because on fine
sundays he often walked out before dinner with the doctor and lucie
secondly because on unfavourable sundays he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend talking reading looking out of window and
generally getting through the day thirdly because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew how the ways of the
doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not to be
found in london there was no way through it and the front windows of
the doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it there were few buildings then
north of the oxford road and forest trees flourished and wild flowers
grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanished fields as a
consequence country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement and there was many a good south wall not far off on which
the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day but when the streets grew hot the corner was in shadow
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness it was a cool spot staid but cheerful a wonderful
place for echoes and a very harbour from the raging streets
there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage and
there was the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house where
several callings purported to be pursued by day but whereof little was
audible any day and which was shunned by all of them at night in
a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree
rustled its green leaves church organs claimed to be made and silver
to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall as if
he had beaten himself precious and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors very little of these trades or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up stairs or of a dim coach trimming maker asserted to have
a counting house below was ever heard or seen occasionally a stray
workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered
about there or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard or a
thump from the golden giant these however were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane tree behind
the house and the echoes in the corner before it had their own way
doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him
his scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and
these things were within mr jarvis lorrys knowledge thoughts and
notice when he rang the door bell of the tranquil house in the corner
possibly at home but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pross as to admission or denial of the
as i am at home myself said mr lorry ill go upstairs
although the doctors daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics simple as the furniture was it was set off
by so many little adornments of no value but for their taste and fancy
that its effect was delightful the disposition of everything in the
rooms from the largest object to the least the arrangement of colours
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles by
delicate hands clear eyes and good sense were at once so pleasant in
themselves and so expressive of their originator that as mr lorry
stood looking about him the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
there were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all mr lorry smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him walked from one to another the first was
the best room and in it were lucies birds and flowers and books
and desk and work table and box of water colours the second was
the doctors consulting room used also as the dining room the third
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane tree in the yard was the
doctors bedroom and there in a corner stood the disused shoemakers
bench and tray of tools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine shop in the suburb of saint antoine in paris
i wonder said mr lorry pausing in his looking about that he keeps
and why wonder at that was the abrupt inquiry that made him start
it proceeded from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose
acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover and
pooh youd have thought said miss pross and mr lorry left off
how do you do inquired that lady then sharply and yet as if to
i am pretty well i thank you answered mr lorry with meekness how
ah indeed said miss pross i am very much put out about my
for gracious sake say something else besides indeed or youll
fidget me to death said miss pross whose character dissociated from
really then said mr lorry as an amendment
really is bad enough returned miss pross but better yes i am
i dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird to
come here looking after her said miss pross
it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her
time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned
dear me said mr lorry as the safest remark he could think of
i have lived with the darling or the darling has lived with me and
paid me for it which she certainly should never have done you may take
your affidavit if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing since she was ten years old and its really very hard
not seeing with precision what was very hard mr lorry shook his head
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet
are always turning up said miss pross when you began it 
didnt you who brought her father to life
oh if that was beginning it  said mr lorry
it wasnt ending it i suppose i say when you began it it was hard
enough not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is no imputation on
him for it was not to be expected that anybody should be under any
circumstances but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have forgiven
him to take ladybirds affections away from me
mr lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous but he also knew her by
this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one of those
unselfish creatures found only among women who will for pure love and
admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost
it to beauty that they never had to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives he knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint he had such an exalted
respect for it that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind we all make such arrangements more or less he stationed miss
pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by nature and art who had balances at tellsons
there never was nor will be but one man worthy of ladybird said
miss pross and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made a
here again mr lorrys inquiries into miss prosss personal history had
established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed as a stake to
speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore with
no touch of compunction miss prosss fidelity of belief in solomon
deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious
matter with mr lorry and had its weight in his good opinion of her
as we happen to be alone for the moment and are both people of
business he said when they had got back to the drawing room and had
sat down there in friendly relations let me ask you does the doctor
in talking with lucie never refer to the shoemaking time yet
and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him
ah returned miss pross shaking her head but i dont say he dont
do you believe that he thinks of it much
do you imagine  mr lorry had begun when miss pross took him up
never imagine anything have no imagination at all
i stand corrected do you suppose you go so far as to suppose
do you suppose mr lorry went on with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye as it looked kindly at her that doctor manette has any
theory of his own preserved through all those years relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed perhaps even to the name of his
i dont suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me
now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because i am a
mere dull man of business and you are a woman of business
rather wishing his modest adjective away mr lorry replied no no
no surely not to return to business is it not remarkable that doctor
manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is should never touch upon that question i will not say with me
though he had business relations with me many years ago and we are now
intimate i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached and who is so devotedly attached to him believe me miss
pross i dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of
well to the best of my understanding and bads the best youll tell
me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid
its plain enough i should think why he may be its a dreadful
remembrance besides that his loss of himself grew out of it not
knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again that alone wouldnt make the
