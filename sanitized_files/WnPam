of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money
old prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasili in
november 1805 announcing that he and his son would be paying him a
visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i shall
think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same
time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasili my son anatole is
accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will allow him
personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he
it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are
coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little
a fortnight after the letter prince vasilis servants came one evening
in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day
old bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasilis
character but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and
alexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and now
from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess
he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned
him on the day of prince vasilis arrival prince bolkonski was
particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad
temper because prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at prince vasilis visit he was in a
bad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architect
not to go to the prince with his report
do you hear how hes walking said tikhon drawing the architects
attention to the sound of the princes footsteps stepping flat on his
however at nine oclock the prince in his velvet coat with a sable
collar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the day
before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the
habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still
visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince went
through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings
can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling
his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to the
the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor
the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be thanked
thought the overseer the storm has blown over
it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i heard
your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor
the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him
what a minister what minister who gave orders he said in his
shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess my
daughter but for a minister for me there are no ministers
you thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more
rapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackguards ill
teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would have
hit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided the
but although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before
him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to
shout blackguards throw the snow back on the road did not lift
his stick again but hurried into the house
before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew that
the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle
bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the same
as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast eyes
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thought
if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with
him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has
the prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snorted
and the other one is not here theyve been telling tales he thought
referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room
she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright
smile so she wont come down it is natural in her state
his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung
it away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the little
princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear
i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne heaven
in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear and
with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize
because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince
reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for
her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald
hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent whole
days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her
so we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle
bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers his
excellency prince vasili kuragin and his son i understand she said
hm his excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the
service said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i dont
understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i dont
want him he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell today
eh afraid of the minister as that idiot alpatych called him this
though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of
a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the
conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and
after the soup the prince became more genial
after dinner he went to see his daughter in law the little princess
was sitting at a small table chattering with masha her maid she grew
she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheeks
had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down
yes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the princes
he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood with
yes your excellency forgive me for heavens sake it was only my
all right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his
unnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and then
prince vasili arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by coachmen
and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of the
lodges over the road purposely laden with snow
prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them
anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a
table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent mindedly fixed his
large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round
of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him and
he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well
and amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much money
he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his
fathers room with the good humored and victorious air natural to him
prince vasilis two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round
with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered as if to say yes thats how i want you to look
i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if
continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned
enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious
if he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole i cant bear
in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that
the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had
been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room
why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never
happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter
the drawing room even if i like him i cant now be myself with him
the mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror the little
princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from masha the
ladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers son
was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty
the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him
like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices
had reached her from the corridor went into princess marys room
you know theyve come marie said the little princess waddling in
she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning
but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch
had been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered her
what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began
theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all
the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be
dressed princess marys self esteem was wounded by the fact that the
arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her
companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise
to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would
prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes
grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive
martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to
mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried
to make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could
think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect
sincerity and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress
no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking
sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon
dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may
be at stake but this one is too light its not becoming
it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary
that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little
princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that
however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it
would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to
which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged
on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her
looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale blue scarf the
little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the
dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her
with her head bent first on one side and then on the other
no it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no mary
really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little gray
everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said to the
maid bring the princess her gray dress and youll see mademoiselle
bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste
but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained
sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the
mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst
come dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one more
the little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princess
well now well arrange something quite simple and becoming she said
the three voices hers mademoiselle bouriennes and katies who was
laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping of
her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist
at least change your coiffure said the little princess didnt i
tell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne
marys is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least not
leave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to me
mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
that princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual
but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they
both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess
mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they
knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to
you will change it wont you said lise and as princess mary gave no
princess mary was left alone she did not comply with lises request
she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her
glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and
pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive
being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different
happy world of his own she fancied a child her own such as she had
seen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughter at her own
breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought
please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came the
she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and
before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her
eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a
lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful
doubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a man
be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of
happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing
was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling from
others and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she said
how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am i
to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thy
will and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the
answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be
not anxious or envious mans future and thy own fate must remain hidden
from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be
gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill
his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the
fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and
having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and
coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what
could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whose
care not a hair of mans head can fall
when princess mary came down prince vasili and his son were already in
the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle
bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels
the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess
indicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess mary saw
them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vasilis face serious
for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and
the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on
the visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and
pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but
him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and
handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasili
approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her
hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she
remembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still could
not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she
touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful light
brown hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck
by his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his
uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one
foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the
princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all
anatole was not quick witted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but
he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and
imperturbable self possession if a man lacking in self confidence
remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the
impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the
effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly
examined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in
this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence
inconvenient let him talk but i dont want to he seemed to say
besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which
particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even love a
supercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was as if he said
to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you
youd be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think this
when he met women even probably he did not for in general he thought
very little but his looks and manner gave that impression the princess
felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare
expect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation was
general and animated thanks to princess lises voice and little downy
lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasili with that
playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in
the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves
there are some semi private long established jokes and amusing
reminiscences though no such reminiscences really exist just as none
existed in this case prince vasili readily adopted her tone and the
little princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these
amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle
bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself
pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences
here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in french
to prince vasili its not as at annettes  receptions where you
always ran away you remember cette chere annette
ah but you wont talk politics to me like annette
why is it you were never at annettes the little princess asked
anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brother
hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger at
him i have even heard of your doings in paris
and didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning to his son
and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and
he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself was
pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh she
is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary
when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the
opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections
she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had
left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the
frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her
about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either
not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that
little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when were
the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering
what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are
prince vasili and that son of his to me prince vasili is a shallow
braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to
himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about
which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever
bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the
prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without
princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him
and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain
theres lise married to andrew a better husband one would think could
hardly be found nowadays but is she contented with her lot and who
would marry marie for love plain and awkward theyll take her for her
connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and even
the happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while dressing and yet
the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer
prince vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of
proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer
his birth and position in society were not bad well ive nothing
against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her
that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloud
he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly
round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress
mademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and the loneliness of his
daughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a fool he
thought looking irritably at her she is shameless and he ignores
well how dye do how dye do glad to see you
friendship laughs at distance began prince vasili in his usual rapid
self confident familiar tone here is my second son please love and
fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and kiss
anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
prince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and began
questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen
attentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princess
and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating
prince vasilis last words then rising he suddenly went up to his
is it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh said he
fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for the
visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are
never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent
it was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with a
you must do as you please said prince bolkonski bowing to his
daughter in law but she need not make a fool of herself shes plain
and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was
on the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said
now you young prince whats your name said prince bolkonski
turning to anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted
now the fun begins thought anatole sitting down with a smile beside
well my dear boy i hear youve been educated abroad not taught to
read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me my
dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the old man
no i have been transferred to the line said anatole hardly able to
ah thats a good thing so my dear boy you wish to serve the tsar
and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow must serve well are
no prince our regiment has gone to the front but i am attached
what is it i am attached to papa said anatole turning to his father
a splendid soldier splendid what am i attached to ha ha ha
laughed prince bolkonski and anatole laughed still louder suddenly
and so youve had him educated abroad prince vasili havent you
i have done my best for him and i can assure you the education there
yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed the lads
a fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now he took prince
vasilis arm and led him to his study as soon as they were alone
together prince vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old
well do you think i shall prevent her that i cant part from her
said the old prince angrily what an idea im ready for it tomorrow
only let me tell you i want to know my son in law better you know my
principles everything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow in your
presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay and ill
see the old prince snorted let her marry its all the same to me
he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son
i will tell you frankly said prince vasili in the tone of a crafty
man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen sighted a
companion you know you see right through people anatole is no
genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son or
as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
without male society on anatoles appearance all the three women of
prince bolkonskis household felt that their life had not been real till
then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately
increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in
darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance
princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the
handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
all her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly and
magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and
but am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try to be
reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already
but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do
and princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new
guest poor girl shes devilish ugly thought anatole
mademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by anatoles
arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young woman
without any definite position without relations or even a country did
not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski to reading
aloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoiselle
bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed
ungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her
off and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew
a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she
liked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had been
seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared and
reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle
bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
story to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince had
appeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear
and he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle
bouriennes head at the very time she was talking to anatole about
paris it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a
moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar
to her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible
the little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any
although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man
tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the
spectacle of his power over these three women besides that he was
beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne
that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions
after tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was
asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spirits
came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoiselle
bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but anatoles
expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her but
to the movements of mademoiselle bouriennes little foot which he was
then touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bourienne
was also looking at princess mary and in her lovely eyes there was a
look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess
how she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now and how
happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband can it be
possible she thought not daring to look at his face but still
in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole
kissed princess marys hand she did not know how she found the courage
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissed
mademoiselle bouriennes hand this was not etiquette but then he did
everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle bourienne
flushed and gave the princess a frightened look
what delicacy thought the princess is it possible that amelie
mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her and not
value her pure affection and devotion to me she went up to her and
kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand
no no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and
smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room
they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed all kept awake a long time that night
is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes kind
that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she had
seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemed
to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark
corner and this someone was he the devil and he was also this man
with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips
she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room
mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere
the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made
she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was
awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the time
when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy
and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated
i should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and her
voice quivered like that of a child about to cry
the old prince did not sleep either tikhon half asleep heard him
pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had
been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed
because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he
loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider
the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but
instead of that he only excited himself more and more
the first man that turns up she forgets her father and everything
else runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice it
fr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had eyes only for
bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not
pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but
the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne
princess marys self esteem would be wounded and his point not to be
parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this
thought he called tikhon and began to undress
what devil brought them here thought he while tikhon was putting the
nightshirt over his dried up old body and gray haired chest i never
invited them they came to disturb my life and there is not much of it
devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the
tikhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud and
therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
tikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his
masters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince
they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency
no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet
into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he
went to the couch on which he slept
though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance
up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary
went to her fathers room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne and
princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation it
seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it she
read this in tikhons face and in that of prince vasilis valet who
made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water
the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his
daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking
expression of her fathers his face wore that expression when his dry
hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her
repeating in a low voice the same words several times over
he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously
i have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an
unnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasili has not
come and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince bolkonski
referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyes
last night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know my
how am i to understand you mon pere said the princess growing pale
how understand me cried her father angrily prince vasili finds you
to his taste as a daughter in law and makes a proposal to you on his
pupils behalf thats how its to be understood how understand
i do not know what you think father whispered the princess
i i what of me leave me out of the question im not going to get
married what about you thats what i want to know
the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to
submit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if i
had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the old
thats admirable he shouted he will take you with your dowry and
take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain shell be the wife while
the prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on his
daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears
now then now then im only joking he said remember this
princess i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
choose i give you freedom only remember that your lifes happiness
theres no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry you or
anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it over
and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no i know
you will pray over it well pray if you like but you had better think
it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted when the
princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the study
her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had said
about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but
still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was
going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing
anything when suddenly the well known whispering of mademoiselle
bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw
anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with
a horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess
mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle
whos that why wait a moment anatoles face seemed to say princess
mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it at last
mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to
princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
an hour later tikhon came to call princess mary to the old prince he
added that prince vasili was also there when tikhon came to her
princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping
mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the
princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle bouriennes
no princess i have lost your affection forever said mademoiselle
why i love you more than ever said princess mary and i will try to
but you despise me you who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion oh only my poor mother
i quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile calm
yourself my dear i will go to my father she said and went out
prince vasili with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in
his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as
if stirred to his hearts core and himself regretting and laughing at
his own sensibility when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a
ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both hands
then sighing he added my sons fate is in your hands decide my
dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a daughter
he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye
fr fr snorted prince bolkonski the prince is making a
proposition to you in his pupils i mean his sons name do you wish
or not to be prince anatole kuragins wife reply yes or no he
shouted and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also
yes my opinion and only my opinion added prince bolkonski turning
to prince vasili and answering his imploring look yes or no
my desire is never to leave you father never to separate my life from
yours i dont wish to marry she answered positively glancing at
prince vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes
humbug nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolkonski
frowning and taking his daughters hand he did not kiss her but only
bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so
my dear i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never never
forget but my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so
prince what i have said is all there is in my heart i thank you for
the honor but i shall never be your sons wife
well so thats finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have seen
you very glad go back to your rooms princess go said the old
prince very very glad to have seen you repeated he embracing
my vocation is a different one thought princess mary my vocation is
to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of love and
self sacrifice and cost what it may i will arrange poor amelies
happiness she loves him so passionately and so passionately repents i
will do all i can to arrange the match between them if he is not rich i
will give her the means i will ask my father and andrew i shall be so
happy when she is his wife she is so unfortunate a stranger alone
helpless and oh god how passionately she must love him if she could
so far forget herself perhaps i might have done the same thought
it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas not till midwinter
was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons
handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the
anna mikhaylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house
on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same
anna mikhaylovna though her circumstances had improved was still
my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to
nikolenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy
the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how tell the
anna mikhaylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped
the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her own
eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till
teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with gods help
at dinner anna mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and
about nikolenka twice asked when the last letter had been received from
him though she knew that already and remarked that they might very
likely be getting a letter from him that day each time that these hints
began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count
and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the
conversation to insignificant matters natasha who of the whole
family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning
of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
father and anna mikhaylovna that it had something to do with her
brother and that anna mikhaylovna was preparing them for it bold as
she was natasha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
relating to nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
chair regardless of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed
head long after anna mikhaylovna and dashing at her flung herself on
her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room
auntie darling do tell me what it is
no dearest sweet one honey i wont give up i know you know
a letter from nikolenka im sure of it exclaimed natasha reading
