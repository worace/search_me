but for gods sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma
i will i will only tell me you wont then i will go and tell at
anna mikhaylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter
on condition that she should tell no one
no on my true word of honor said natasha crossing herself i wont
tell anyone and she ran off at once to sonya
nikolenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful triumph
nicholas was all sonya said instantly turning white
natasha seeing the impression the news of her brothers wound produced
on sonya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news
she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry
a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he
there now its true that all you women are crybabies remarked petya
pacing the room with large resolute strides now im very glad very
glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so you are all
no but she said that it was all over and that hes now an officer
thank god said sonya crossing herself but perhaps she deceived
petya paced the room in silence for a time
if id been in nikolenkas place i would have killed even more of those
frenchmen he said what nasty brutes they are id have killed so
many that thered have been a heap of them
hold your tongue petya what a goose you are
im not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said petya
do you remember him natasha suddenly asked after a moments silence
no sonya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly
remember everything said natasha with an expressive gesture
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning i remember
nikolenka too i remember him well she said but i dont remember
what you dont remember boris asked sonya in surprise
its not that i dont remember i know what he is like but not as i
remember nikolenka him i just shut my eyes and remember but boris
no she shut her eyes no theres nothing at all
oh natasha said sonya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her
friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to
say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was
out of the question i am in love with your brother once for all and
whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as
natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said
nothing she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such
love as sonya was speaking of but natasha had not yet felt anything
like it she believed it could be but did not understand it
sonya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and
whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already an
officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself
and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on
i dont know i think if he writes i will write too she said
and you wont feel ashamed to write to him
and i should be ashamed to write to boris im not going to
well i dont know its awkward and would make me ashamed
and i know why shed be ashamed said petya offended by natashas
previous remark its because she was in love with that fat one in
spectacles that was how petya described his namesake the new count
bezukhov and now shes in love with that singer he meant natashas
not more stupid than you madam said the nine year old petya with
the countess had been prepared by anna mikhaylovnas hints at dinner on
retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a
miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears
kept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter came on
dont come in she said to the old count who was following her come
later and she went in closing the door behind her
the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened
at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna
mikhaylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence
then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps
anna mikhaylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression of
a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the
countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips
when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his
bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait
and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away
the bald head vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the room and
the reading of the letter began after a brief description of the
campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his
promotion nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothers hands
asking for their blessing and that he kissed vera natasha and petya
besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schoss
and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear sonya whom he
loved and thought of just the same as ever when she heard this sonya
blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks
turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at
full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and
smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was crying
why are you crying mamma asked vera from all he says one should be
this was quite true but the count the countess and natasha looked at
her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought the
nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were
considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she did
not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses and
dmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter
each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
proofs of nikolenkas virtues how strange how extraordinary how
joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had
first learned to say pear and then granny that this son should now
be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warrior
doing some kind of mans work of his own without help or guidance the
universal experience of ages showing that children do grow
imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the
countess her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages had
seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty years
before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to
speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this
what a style how charmingly he describes said she reading the
descriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word about
himself not a word about some denisov or other though he himself
i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about his
sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has remembered
everybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only so
for more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of
letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out
while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of
the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikhaylovna
practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army
authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
and her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand
duke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostovs
supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address
and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards
there was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regiment
which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was
decided to send the letters and money by the grand dukes courier to
boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the letters were from
the old count the countess petya vera natasha and sonya and
finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
things the old count sent to his son
on the twelfth of november kutuzovs active army in camp before
olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors the
russian and the austrian the guards just arrived from russia spent
the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight
to the review reaching the field at olmutz by ten oclock
that day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris telling him that
the ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmutz
and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him
rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops after
their active service were stationed near olmutz and the camp swarmed
with well provisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of
tempting wares the pavlograds held feast after feast celebrating
awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to
olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently
opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses rostov who had just
celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought denisovs horse
bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and the sutlers on
receiving boris letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmutz dined
there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the guards
camp to find his old playmate rostov had not yet had time to get his
uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a soldiers
cross equally shabby cadets riding breeches lined with worn leather
and an officers saber with a sword knot the don horse he was riding
was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign and he wore a
crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head as he
rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress boris and all his
comrades of the guards by his appearance that of a fighting hussar who
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading
their cleanliness and discipline they had come by easy stages their
knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided
excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments
had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand
dukes orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on
which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their
proper posts boris had been quartered and had marched all the way
with berg who was already in command of a company berg who had
obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of
his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
matters very satisfactorily boris during the campaign had made the
acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a
letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become
acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped to obtain
a post on the commander in chiefs staff berg and boris having rested
after yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a
round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess berg
held a smoking pipe between his knees boris in the accurate way
characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen with
his delicate white fingers while awaiting bergs move and watched his
opponents face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
well try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing his
here he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh you
petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian
nurses french at which he and boris used to laugh long ago
boris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady and
replace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace his
friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youth
that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner
different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas
wished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch
him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did but
notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way and
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young
men take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes in
the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them
oh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete not
like us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swagger and
with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his own mud
bespattered breeches the german landlady hearing rostovs loud voice
eh is she pretty he asked with a wink
why do you shout so youll frighten them said boris i did not
expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday by
bolkonski an adjutant of kutuzovs whos a friend of mine i did not
think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you been
without answering rostov shook the soldiers cross of st george
fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm
indeed yes yes said boris with a smile and we too have had a
splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rode
with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every
advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls i
cant tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to all our
and the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his
hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures
and advantages of service under members of the imperial family
oh you guards said rostov i say send for some wine
he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent
yes and i have some money and a letter to give you he added
rostov took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both
arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines he
glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the
well theyve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy purse
that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our pay i
i say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get a letter from
home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything
over with and i happen to be there ill go at once to be out of your
way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and
immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his
face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added
dont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to an
oh dont mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up
and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
go across to our hosts they invited you added boris
berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having
assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been
noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter
oh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them such a
fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly well
have you sent gabriel for some wine all right lets have some
in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
to bagration which the old countess at anna mikhaylovnas advice had
obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take
it to its destination and make use of it
what nonsense much i need it said rostov throwing the letter under
why have you thrown that away asked boris
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it
why what the devil said boris picking it up and reading the
address this letter would be of great use to you
i want nothing and i wont be anyones adjutant
you are still the same dreamer i see remarked boris shaking his
and youre still the same diplomatist but thats not the point
well as you see so far everythings all right but i confess i should
much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front
because when once a man starts on military service he should try to
make as successful a career of it as possible
oh thats it said rostov evidently thinking of something else
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently
trying in vain to find the answer to some question
shouldnt we now send for berg asked boris he would drink with you
well send for him and how do you get on with that german asked
he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered boris
again rostov looked intently into boris eyes and sighed berg returned
and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers
became animated the guardsmen told rostov of their march and how they
had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of the
sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories
of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the
subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of
the grand dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he
had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of
the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a
pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a
violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichs
favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company
would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i
was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army
orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lords
prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and so
my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showed
how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would
have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self
complacency than his did well he stormed at me as the saying is
stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but rather
of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to
siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the right
so i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb he
shouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the next
day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day thats what
keeping ones head means thats the way count said berg lighting
but boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and
skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about it and
as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schon
grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally
do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they
have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as
it really was rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account
have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to tell
everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and
inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his
hearers who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
just such a story they would either not have believed him or still
worse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since what
generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as
it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of
will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth
and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story
of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like
a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his
saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he
in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew
whom boris was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to
help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and
being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day
before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent with
papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on boris hoping to
find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting
his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of man
he gave boris a pleasant smile frowned as with half closed eyes he
looked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on
the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company
rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere
stranger glancing however at boris he saw that he too seemed ashamed
in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the
contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view
regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent
boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without
we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to
say more in the presence of a stranger
berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was
rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give
no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed
as to your business prince andrew continued addressing boris we
will talk of it later and he looked round at rostov come to me
after the review and we will do what is possible
and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostov
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were
talking of the schon grabern affair were you there
i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aide
bolkonski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him with a
slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now
yes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown
furious now at boris now at bolkonski yes many stories but our
stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire our
stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the
of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and
a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mans
self possession mingled at that moment in rostovs soul
i am not talking about you he said i dont know you and frankly i
dont want to i am speaking of the staff in general
and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet
authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that
it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient self respect
but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two
we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and
besides drubetskoy who says he is an old friend of yours is not at
all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however
he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont
forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all
insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter
drop well then on friday after the review i shall expect you
drubetskoy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them
only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought to
have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he
ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home
should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried
him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
the day after rostov had been to see boris a review was held of the
austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and
those who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors the
russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the archduke
inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men
from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up
on the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets
moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying
formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of
infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs
and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided
uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan
or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the
smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the
generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and
wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded
officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed
till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
smooth felt that no small matter was happening but an important and
solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet
at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
oclock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drawn up on
the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry
in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry
a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops the
three parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutuzovs fighting
army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front those
recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the line and
the austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines under one
like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper theyre coming theyre
coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation
from the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seen
approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it
looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting eyes
front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by
others from various sides and all became silent
in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this was
the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and the
trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it
seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army
itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst into
music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor
alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the
first regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and
joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
rostov standing in the front lines of kutuzovs army which the tsar
approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in
that army a feeling of self forgetfulness a proud consciousness of
might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he
himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water
commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could
not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word
hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after
another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then
hurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah growing
ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar
till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility
seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
already passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two men the
emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that
the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse
guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his
pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyones
rostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had
recognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twenty
paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness and
ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every
movement of the tsars seemed to him enchanting
stopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in french
seeing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in
some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsar
called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him
oh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought
the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen i
thank you with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like a
voice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar
you have earned the st georges standards and will be worthy of them
oh to die to die for him thought rostov
the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the
rostov too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all his
might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if
the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided
how can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but then even this
indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything else
that hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars foot in the narrow
pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he
moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides de camp
farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at
last only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suites
among the gentlemen of the suite rostov noticed bolkonski sitting his
horse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel of
yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
not to challenge bolkonski of course not he now thought is it
worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such
love such rapture and such self sacrifice what do any of our quarrels
and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now
when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a
ceremonial march past him and rostov on bedouin recently purchased
from denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadron that is alone
before he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman spurred
bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his
tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the emperors eye upon
him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful
action as if flying through the air without touching the ground
rostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but
blissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed it
my god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also
kutuzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about
the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte
and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the essen corps
but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his
every word and movement was described with ecstasy
they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the
enemy under the emperors command commanded by the emperor himself they
could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought
rostov and most of the officers after the review
all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
the day after the review boris in his best uniform and with his
comrade bergs best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkonski
wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best
post he could preferably that of adjutant to some important personage
a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is all
very well for rostov whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a
time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyones
lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and
must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he
he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance of
the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
and the two emperors were living with their suites households and
courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world
he knew no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all these
exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military men
seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the
guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be
aware of his existence at the quarters of the commander in chief
kutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even the
orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great
many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was
heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it next
day november 15 after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering the
house occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in and
boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing
but in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds a
table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the door was
sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another the
red stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his head
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was
playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on the
clavichord sang the tune bolkonski was not there none of these
gentlemen changed his position on seeing boris the one who was writing
and whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski was
on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
reception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went to
the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals
when he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with
that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if it
were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening
to an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost
on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple face
very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the
general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris prince
andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
at that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised that
in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was
another more important subordination which made this tight laced
purple faced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for
his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more than
ever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written
code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having
been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general
who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the
guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand
i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about
with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions
when germans start being accurate theres no end to it
boris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as
something generally known but it was the first time he had heard
well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have been
yes i was thinking for some reason boris could not help blushing
of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince
kuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards wont
be in action he added as if in apology
all right all right well talk it over replied prince andrew only
let me report this gentlemans business and i shall be at your
while prince andrew went to report about the purple faced general that
gentleman evidently not sharing boris conception of the advantages of
the unwritten code of subordination looked so fixedly at the
presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away and
waited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commander in
you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said prince
andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was
its no use your going to the commander in chief he would say a lot of
pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards
the unwritten code thought boris but nothing more would come of it
there will soon be a battalion of us aides de camp and adjutants but
this is what well do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an
excellent fellow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it the
fact is that now kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing
everything is now centered round the emperor so we will go to
dolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him
about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find
a place for you somewhere nearer the sun
prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of
this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for
himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
which attracted him he very readily took up boris cause and went with
it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz
that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary
to the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg it
had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte
the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by boris
arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was
still under the spell of the days council at which the party of the
young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised
waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely
silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the
advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council the
coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no
longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantages
were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to
napoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the
emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where
the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the
austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the
austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where
the french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and
shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened
dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned
from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory
that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protege but prince
dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to boris
and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in
his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french
ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that the
one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear
fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having been
unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude
what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for
every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my
dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been
devised this combination of austrian precision with russian valor what
so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonski
and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has
decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him
is that so and what did he say inquired bolkonski
what can he say tra di ri di ra and so on merely to gain time i
tell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was most amusing
he continued with a sudden good natured laugh was that we could not
think how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not as
emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte
but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general
thats just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you know
bilibin hes a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him as
all the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the address
to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement
francais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction good wasnt it
yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski
oh yes very much my brother knows him hes dined with him the
present emperor more than once in paris and tells me he never met a
more cunning or subtle diplomatist you know a combination of french
adroitness and italian play acting do you know the tale about him and
count markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handle him
you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful
and the talkative dolgorukov turning now to boris now to prince
andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassador
purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at
markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markov
immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching
delightful said bolkonski but i have come to you prince as a
petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before prince
andrew could finish an aide de camp came in to summon dolgorukov to the
oh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly and
pressing the hands of prince andrew and boris you know i should be
very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
good natured sincere and animated levity but you see another
boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he
was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny
obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out
into the corridor and met coming out of the door of the emperors room
by which dolgorukov had entered a short man in civilian clothes with a
