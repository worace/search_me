yes answered the old spinster it is a disease
it is a malady that one gets without knowing how
fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the
that evening she went out and was seen to turn her steps in the
direction of the rue de paris where the inns are situated
the next morning when marguerite entered fantines room before
daylight for they always worked together and in this manner used only
one candle for the two she found fantine seated on her bed pale and
frozen she had not lain down her cap had fallen on her knees
her candle had burned all night and was almost entirely consumed
marguerite halted on the threshold petrified at this tremendous
lord the candle is all burned out something has happened
then she looked at fantine who turned toward her her head bereft of its
fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night
jesus said marguerite what is the matter with you fantine
nothing replied fantine quite the contrary my child will not die
of that frightful malady for lack of succor i am content
so saying she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were
ah jesus god cried marguerite why it is a fortune where did you
at the same time she smiled the candle illuminated her countenance it
was a bloody smile a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips and
she had a black hole in her mouth
after all it was a ruse of the thenardiers to obtain money cosette was
fantine threw her mirror out of the window she had long since quitted
her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten
it next the roof one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle
with the floor and knocks you on the head every instant the poor
occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his
destiny only by bending over more and more
she had no longer a bed a rag which she called her coverlet a mattress
on the floor and a seatless chair still remained a little rosebush
which she had had dried up forgotten in one corner in the other
corner was a butter pot to hold water which froze in winter and in
which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these
circles of ice she had lost her shame she lost her coquetry a final
sign she went out with dirty caps whether from lack of time or from
indifference she no longer mended her linen as the heels wore out
she dragged her stockings down into her shoes this was evident from the
perpendicular wrinkles she patched her bodice which was old and worn
out with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement the
people to whom she was indebted made scenes and gave her no peace
she found them in the street she found them again on her staircase she
passed many a night weeping and thinking her eyes were very bright
and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the
left shoulder blade she coughed a great deal she deeply hated father
madeleine but made no complaint she sewed seventeen hours a day but
a contractor for the work of prisons who made the prisoners work at a
discount suddenly made prices fall which reduced the daily earnings
of working women to nine sous seventeen hours of toil and nine sous a
day her creditors were more pitiless than ever the second hand dealer
who had taken back nearly all his furniture said to her incessantly
when will you pay me you hussy what did they want of her good god
she felt that she was being hunted and something of the wild beast
developed in her about the same time thenardier wrote to her that he
had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a
hundred francs at once otherwise he would turn little cosette out of
doors convalescent as she was from her heavy illness into the cold and
the streets and that she might do what she liked with herself and die
if she chose a hundred francs thought fantine but in what trade
can one earn a hundred sous a day
come said she let us sell what is left
the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town
what is this history of fantine it is society purchasing a slave
from hunger cold isolation destitution a dolorous bargain a soul
for a morsel of bread misery offers society accepts
the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization but it does
not as yet permeate it it is said that slavery has disappeared from
european civilization this is a mistake it still exists but it weighs
only upon the woman and it is called prostitution
it weighs upon the woman that is to say upon grace weakness beauty
maternity this is not one of the least of mans disgraces
at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached nothing
is left to fantine of that which she had formerly been
she has become marble in becoming mire whoever touches her feels cold
she passes she endures you she ignores you she is the severe and
dishonored figure life and the social order have said their last word
for her all has happened to her that will happen to her she has
everything lost everything mourned everything she is resigned with
that resignation which resembles indifference as death resembles sleep
she no longer avoids anything let all the clouds fall upon her and all
the ocean sweep over her what matters it to her she is a sponge that
at least she believes it to be so but it is an error to imagine that
fate can be exhausted and that one has reached the bottom of anything
alas what are all these fates driven on pell mell whither are they
he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow
there is in all small towns and there was at m sur m in particular
a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred
francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred
thousand francs a year in paris these are beings of the great neuter
species impotent men parasites cyphers who have a little land a
little folly a little wit who would be rustics in a drawing room and
who think themselves gentlemen in the dram shop who say my fields
my peasants my woods who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that
they are persons of taste quarrel with the officers of the garrison
to prove that they are men of war hunt smoke yawn drink smell of
tobacco play billiards stare at travellers as they descend from the
diligence live at the cafe dine at the inn have a dog which eats the
bones under the table and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table
who stick at a sou exaggerate the fashions admire tragedy despise
women wear out their old boots copy london through paris and paris
through the medium of pont a mousson grow old as dullards never work
serve no use and do no great harm
m felix tholomyes had he remained in his own province and never beheld
paris would have been one of these men
if they were richer one would say they are dandies if they were
poorer one would say they are idlers they are simply men without
employment among these unemployed there are bores the bored dreamers
at that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar a big cravat a
watch with trinkets three vests of different colors worn one on top of
the other the red and blue inside of a short waisted olive coat with
a codfish tail a double row of silver buttons set close to each other
and running up to the shoulder and a pair of trousers of a lighter
shade of olive ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite but
always uneven number of lines varying from one to eleven a limit
which was never exceeded add to this high shoes with little irons
on the heels a tall hat with a narrow brim hair worn in a tuft an
enormous cane and conversation set off by puns of potier over all
spurs and a mustache at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois
the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of
it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with
the king of spain of bolivar against morillo narrow brimmed hats were
royalist and were called morillos liberals wore hats with wide brims
eight or ten months then after that which is related in the preceding
pages towards the first of january 1823 on a snowy evening one of
these dandies one of these unemployed a right thinker for he wore
a morillo and was moreover warmly enveloped in one of those large
cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather was
amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a
ball dress with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair in front of
the officers cafe this dandy was smoking for he was decidedly
each time that the woman passed in front of him he bestowed on her
together with a puff from his cigar some apostrophe which he considered
witty and mirthful such as how ugly you are will you get out of my
sight you have no teeth etc etc this gentleman was known as m
bamatabois the woman a melancholy decorated spectre which went and
came through the snow made him no reply did not even glance at him
and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence and with a sombre
regularity which brought her every five minutes within reach of this
sarcasm like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods the
small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger and taking
advantage of a moment when her back was turned he crept up behind her
with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh bent down picked up a
handful of snow from the pavement and thrust it abruptly into her back
between her bare shoulders the woman uttered a roar whirled round
gave a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her
nails in his face with the most frightful words which could fall from
the guard room into the gutter these insults poured forth in a voice
roughened by brandy did indeed proceed in hideous wise from a mouth
which lacked its two front teeth it was fantine
at the noise thus produced the officers ran out in throngs from the
cafe passers by collected and a large and merry circle hooting and
applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings
whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman the
man struggling his hat on the ground the woman striking out with feet
and fists bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth livid with wrath
suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd
seized the woman by her satin bodice which was covered with mud and
the woman raised her head her furious voice suddenly died away her
eyes were glassy she turned pale instead of livid and she trembled
with a quiver of terror she had recognized javert
the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape
chapter xiii the solution of some questions connected with the
javert thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out
with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the
extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him she
yielded mechanically neither he nor she uttered a word the cloud of
spectators followed jesting in a paroxysm of delight supreme misery
on arriving at the police station which was a low room warmed by a
stove with a glazed and grated door opening on the street and guarded
by a detachment javert opened the door entered with fantine and shut
the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who
raised themselves on tiptoe and craned their necks in front of the
thick glass of the station house in their effort to see curiosity is a
sort of gluttony to see is to devour
on entering fantine fell down in a corner motionless and mute
the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table javert
seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began
this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion
of the police the latter do what they please punish them as seems
good to them and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which
they entitle their industry and their liberty javert was impassive his
grave face betrayed no emotion whatever nevertheless he was seriously
and deeply preoccupied it was one of those moments when he was
exercising without control but subject to all the scruples of a severe
conscience his redoubtable discretionary power at that moment he was
conscious that his police agents stool was a tribunal he was entering
judgment he judged and condemned he summoned all the ideas which could
possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing
the more he examined the deed of this woman the more shocked he felt
it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime
he had just beheld yonder in the street society in the person of a
freeholder and an elector insulted and attacked by a creature who was
outside all pales a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a
citizen he had seen that he javert he wrote in silence
when he had finished he signed the paper folded it and said to the
sergeant of the guard as he handed it to him take three men and
then turning to fantine you are to have six months of it the
six months six months of prison she exclaimed six months in which
to earn seven sous a day but what will become of cosette my daughter
my daughter but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs do
she dragged herself across the damp floor among the muddy boots of all
those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides
monsieur javert said she i beseech your mercy i assure you that
i was not in the wrong if you had seen the beginning you would have
seen i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame that
gentleman the bourgeois whom i do not know put snow in my back has
any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along
peaceably and doing no harm to any one i am rather ill as you see
and then he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time
you are ugly you have no teeth i know well that i have no longer
those teeth i did nothing i said to myself the gentleman is amusing
himself i was honest with him i did not speak to him it was at that
moment that he put the snow down my back monsieur javert good monsieur
inspector is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you
that this is quite true perhaps i did wrong to get angry you know that
one is not master of ones self at the first moment one gives way to
vivacity and then when some one puts something cold down your
back just when you are not expecting it i did wrong to spoil that
gentlemans hat why did he go away i would ask his pardon oh my god
it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon do me the favor
to day for this once monsieur javert hold you do not know that in
prison one can earn only seven sous a day it is not the governments
fault but seven sous is ones earnings and just fancy i must pay
one hundred francs or my little girl will be sent to me oh my god
i cannot have her with me what i do is so vile oh my cosette oh my
little angel of the holy virgin what will become of her poor creature
i will tell you it is the thenardiers inn keepers peasants and such
people are unreasonable they want money dont put me in prison you
see there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to
get along as best she may in the very heart of the winter and you must
have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert if she were older
she might earn her living but it cannot be done at that age i am not a
bad woman at bottom it is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made
me what i am if i have drunk brandy it was out of misery i do not
love it but it benumbs the senses when i was happy it was only
necessary to glance into my closets and it would have been evident that
i was not a coquettish and untidy woman i had linen a great deal of
she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with sobs blinded with tears
her neck bare wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short cough
stammering softly with a voice of agony great sorrow is a divine and
terrible ray which transfigures the unhappy at that moment fantine had
become beautiful once more from time to time she paused and tenderly
kissed the police agents coat she would have softened a heart of
granite but a heart of wood cannot be softened
come said javert i have heard you out have you entirely finished
you will get six months now march the eternal father in person could
at these solemn words the eternal father in person could do nothing
more she understood that her fate was sealed she sank down
a few moments earlier a man had entered but no one had paid any heed
to him he shut the door leaned his back against it and listened to
at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate
woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said
javert raised his eyes and recognized m madeleine he removed his hat
and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness
the words mr mayor produced a curious effect upon fantine she rose
to her feet with one bound like a spectre springing from the earth
thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up to m
madeleine before any one could prevent her and gazing intently at him
ah so it is you who are m le maire
then she burst into a laugh and spit in his face
javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad he experienced at
that moment blow upon blow and almost simultaneously the most violent
emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life to see a woman of
the town spit in the mayors face was a thing so monstrous that in his
most daring flights of fancy he would have regarded it as a sacrilege
to believe it possible on the other hand at the very bottom of his
thought he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was and as
to what this mayor might be and then he with horror caught a glimpse
of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack but
when he beheld that mayor that magistrate calmly wipe his face and
say set this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication
of amazement thought and word failed him equally the sum total of
possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case he remained mute
the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantine she raised
her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stove like a person who
is reeling nevertheless she glanced about her and began to speak in a
at liberty i am to be allowed to go i am not to go to prison for six
months who said that it is not possible that any one could have said
that i did not hear aright it cannot have been that monster of a
mayor was it you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be
set free oh see here i will tell you about it and you will let me
go that monster of a mayor that old blackguard of a mayor is the
cause of all just imagine monsieur javert he turned me out all
because of a pack of rascally women who gossip in the workroom if that
is not a horror what is to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her
work honestly then i could no longer earn enough and all this misery
followed in the first place there is one improvement which these
gentlemen of the police ought to make and that is to prevent prison
contractors from wronging poor people i will explain it to you you
see you are earning twelve sous at shirt making the price falls to
nine sous and it is not enough to live on then one has to become
whatever one can as for me i had my little cosette and i was actually
forced to become a bad woman now you understand how it is that that
blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief after that i stamped on
that gentlemans hat in front of the officers cafe but he had spoiled
my whole dress with snow we women have but one silk dress for evening
wear you see that i did not do wrong deliberately truly monsieur
javert and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i
and who are much happier o monsieur javert it was you who gave orders
that i am to be set free was it not make inquiries speak to my
landlord i am paying my rent now they will tell you that i am
perfectly honest ah my god i beg your pardon i have unintentionally
touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke
m madeleine listened to her with profound attention while she was
speaking he fumbled in his waistcoat drew out his purse and opened
it it was empty he put it back in his pocket he said to fantine how
fantine who was looking at javert only turned towards him
say you fellows did you see how i spit in his face ah you old
wretch of a mayor you came here to frighten me but im not afraid of
you i am afraid of monsieur javert i am afraid of my good monsieur
so saying she turned to the inspector again
and yet you see mr inspector it is necessary to be just i
understand that you are just mr inspector in fact it is perfectly
simple a man amuses himself by putting snow down a womans back and
that makes the officers laugh one must divert themselves in some way
and we well we are here for them to amuse themselves with of course
and then you you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order
you lead off the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you
are a good man you say that i am to be set at liberty it is for
the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my
supporting my child only dont do it again you hussy oh i wont
do it again monsieur javert they may do whatever they please to me
now i will not stir but to day you see i cried because it hurt me
i was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all and then as i
told you i am not well i have a cough i seem to have a burning ball
in my stomach and the doctor tells me take care of yourself here
feel give me your hand dont be afraid it is here
she no longer wept her voice was caressing she placed javerts coarse
hand on her delicate white throat and looked smilingly at him
all at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments dropped the
folds of her skirt which had been pushed up as she dragged herself
along almost to the height of her knee and stepped towards the door
saying to the soldiers in a low voice and with a friendly nod
children monsieur linspecteur has said that i am to be released and
she laid her hand on the latch of the door one step more and she would
javert up to that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes
fixed on the ground cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue
which is waiting to be put away somewhere
the sound of the latch roused him he raised his head with an expression
of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in
proportion as the authority rests on a low level ferocious in the wild
beast atrocious in the man of no estate
sergeant he cried dont you see that that jade is walking off who
fantine trembled at the sound of javerts voice and let go of the latch
as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen at the sound
of madeleines voice she turned around and from that moment forth she
uttered no word nor dared so much as to breathe freely but her glance
strayed from madeleine to javert and from javert to madeleine in turn
it was evident that javert must have been exasperated beyond measure
before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he
had done after the mayors suggestion that fantine should be set at
liberty had he reached the point of forgetting the mayors presence
had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any
authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must
certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending
it or in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the
past two hours did he say to himself that it was necessary to recur to
supreme resolutions that it was indispensable that the small should
be made great that the police spy should transform himself into a
magistrate that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice and
that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government
society in its entirety was personified in him javert
however that may be when m madeleine uttered that word i as we
have just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the
mayor pale cold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body
agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and
say to him with downcast eyes but a firm voice
inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and conciliating tone
listen you are an honest man and i feel no hesitation in explaining
matters to you here is the true state of the case i was passing
through the square just as you were leading this woman away there were
still groups of people standing about and i made inquiries and learned
everything it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have
this wretch has just insulted monsieur le maire
that concerns me said m madeleine my own insult belongs to me i
think i can do what i please about it
i beg monsieur le maires pardon the insult is not to him but to the
inspector javert replied m madeleine the highest law is
conscience i have heard this woman i know what i am doing
and i mr mayor do not know what i see
i am obeying my duty my duty demands that this woman shall serve six
heed this well she will not serve a single day
at this decisive word javert ventured to fix a searching look on the
mayor and to say but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly
i am sorry to oppose monsieur le maire it is for the first time in my
life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my
authority i confine myself since monsieur le maire desires it to the
question of the gentleman i was present this woman flung herself
on monsieur bamatabnois who is an elector and the proprietor of that
handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade
three stories high and entirely of cut stone such things as there are
in the world in any case monsieur le maire this is a question of
police regulations in the streets and concerns me and i shall detain
then m madeleine folded his arms and said in a severe voice which no
the matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal
police according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and
sixty six of the code of criminal examination i am the judge i order
that this woman shall be set at liberty
i refer you to article eighty one of the law of the 13th of december
javert received the blow erect full in the face in his breast like
a russian soldier he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left
fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he
nevertheless she also was the prey to a strange confusion she had just
seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers she had
seen two men who held in their hands her liberty her life her soul
her child in combat before her very eyes one of these men was drawing
her towards darkness the other was leading her back towards the light
in this conflict viewed through the exaggerations of terror these two
men had appeared to her like two giants the one spoke like her demon
the other like her good angel the angel had conquered the demon and
strange to say that which made her shudder from head to foot was
the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man whom she
abhorred that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all
her woes that madeleine and at the very moment when she had insulted
him in so hideous a fashion he had saved her had she then been
mistaken must she change her whole soul she did not know she
trembled she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and
at every word uttered by m madeleine she felt the frightful shades of
hatred crumble and melt within her and something warm and ineffable
indescribable which was both joy confidence and love dawn in her
when javert had taken his departure m madeleine turned to her and said
to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to
weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking
i have heard you i knew nothing about what you have mentioned i
believe that it is true and i feel that it is true i was even ignorant
of the fact that you had left my shop why did you not apply to me but
here i will pay your debts i will send for your child or you shall go
to her you shall live here in paris or where you please i undertake
the care of your child and yourself you shall not work any longer if
you do not like i will give all the money you require you shall be
honest and happy once more and listen i declare to you that if all
is as you say and i do not doubt it you have never ceased to be
virtuous and holy in the sight of god oh poor woman
this was more than fantine could bear to have cosette to leave this
life of infamy to live free rich happy respectable with cosette to
see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of
her misery she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her and
could only give vent to two or three sobs oh oh oh
her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m madeleine and
before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her
m madeleine had fantine removed to that infirmary which he had
established in his own house he confided her to the sisters who put
her to bed a burning fever had come on she passed a part of the night
in delirium and raving at length however she fell asleep
on the morrow towards midday fantine awoke she heard some one
breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and saw m
madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head his
gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication she followed its
direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to
thenceforth m madeleine was transfigured in fantines eyes he seemed
to her to be clothed in light he was absorbed in a sort of prayer she
gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him at last
m madeleine had been there for an hour he had been waiting for fantine
to awake he took her hand felt of her pulse and replied
well i have slept she replied i think that i am better it is
he answered responding to the first question which she had put to him
i was praying to the martyr there on high
and he added in his own mind for the martyr here below
m madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries
he knew all now he knew fantines history in all its heart rending
you have suffered much poor mother oh do not complain you now have
the dowry of the elect it is thus that men are transformed into angels
it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise
you see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of
he sighed deeply but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which
that same night javert wrote a letter the next morning be posted it
himself at the office of m sur m it was addressed to paris and the
superscription ran to monsieur chabouillet secretary of monsieur le
prefet of police as the affair in the station house had been bruited
about the post mistress and some other persons who saw the letter
before it was sent off and who recognized javerts handwriting on the
cover thought that he was sending in his resignation
m madeleine made haste to write to the thenardiers fantine owed
them one hundred and twenty francs he sent them three hundred francs
telling them to pay themselves from that sum and to fetch the child
instantly to m sur m where her sick mother required her presence
this dazzled thenardier the devil said the man to his wife dont
lets allow the child to go this lark is going to turn into a milch
cow i see through it some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother
he replied with a very well drawn up bill for five hundred and some odd
francs in this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three
hundred francs one for the doctor the other for the apothecary
who had attended and physicked eponine and azelma through two long
illnesses cosette as we have already said had not been ill it was
only a question of a trifling substitution of names at the foot of the
memorandum thenardier wrote received on account three hundred francs
m madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote
christi said thenardier lets not give up the child
in the meantime fantine did not recover she still remained in the
the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman with
repugnance those who have seen the bas reliefs of rheims will recall
the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the
foolish virgins the ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is
one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters
felt it with the double force contributed by religion but in a few days
fantine disarmed them she said all kinds of humble and gentle things
and the mother in her provoked tenderness one day the sisters heard
her say amid her fever i have been a sinner but when i have my child
beside me it will be a sign that god has pardoned me while i was
leading a bad life i should not have liked to have my cosette with me
i could not have borne her sad astonished eyes it was for her sake
that i did evil and that is why god pardons me i shall feel the
benediction of the good god when cosette is here i shall gaze at her
it will do me good to see that innocent creature she knows nothing at
all she is an angel you see my sisters at that age the wings have
m madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him
to morrow perhaps she may arrive at any moment i am expecting her
oh she said how happy i am going to be
we have just said that she did not recover her health on the contrary
her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week that
handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder blades had
brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration as a consequence of
which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years
was violently developed at last at that time people were beginning to
follow the fine laennecs fine suggestions in the study and treatment of
chest maladies the doctor sounded fantines chest and shook his head
has she not a child which she desires to see said the doctor
he said that your child was to be brought speedily that that would
oh she rejoined he is right but what do those thenardiers mean
by keeping my cosette from me oh she is coming at last i behold
in the meantime thenardier did not let go of the child and gave a
hundred insufficient reasons for it cosette was not quite well enough
to take a journey in the winter and then there still remained some
petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood and they were collecting
i shall send some one to fetch cosette said father madeleine if
he wrote the following letter to fantines dictation and made her sign
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect
in the meantime a serious incident occurred carve as we will the
mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny
one morning m madeleine was in his study occupied in arranging in
advance some pressing matters connected with the mayors office in case
he should decide to take the trip to montfermeil when he was informed
that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him
madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing
this name javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the
police station and m madeleine had not seen him
m madeleine had retained his seat near the fire pen in hand his eyes
fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which
contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of
police regulations he did not disturb himself on javerts account he
could not help thinking of poor fantine and it suited him to be glacial
javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor whose back was turned
to him the mayor did not look at him but went on annotating this
javert advanced two or three paces into the study and halted without
if any physiognomist who had been familiar with javert and who had
made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization
this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the
corporal this spy who was incapable of a lie this unspotted police
agent if any physiognomist had known his secret and long cherished
aversion for m madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject of
fantine and had examined javert at that moment he would have said to
himself what has taken place it was evident to any one acquainted
with that clear upright sincere honest austere and ferocious
conscience that javert had but just gone through some great interior
struggle javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his
countenance like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt
changes of opinion his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and
startling on entering he bowed to m madeleine with a look in which
there was neither rancor anger nor distrust he halted a few paces in
the rear of the mayors arm chair and there he stood perfectly erect
in an attitude almost of discipline with the cold ingenuous roughness
of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient he
waited without uttering a word without making a movement in genuine
humility and tranquil resignation calm serious hat in hand with
eyes cast down and an expression which was half way between that of a
soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence
of his judge until it should please the mayor to turn round all the
sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed
to him had disappeared that face as impenetrable and simple as
granite no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy
depression his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an
at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round
well what is it what is the matter javert
javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas
then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not
this is the matter mr mayor a culpable act has been committed
an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the
gravest manner towards a magistrate i have come to bring the fact to
your knowledge as it is my duty to do
and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent
m madeleine sat erect in his arm chair javert went on with a severe
mr mayor i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to
m madeleine opened his mouth in amazement javert interrupted him
you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does
not suffice handing in ones resignation is honorable i have failed in
my duty i ought to be punished i must be turned out
mr mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly be so
come now why exclaimed m madeleine what nonsense is this
what is the meaning of this what culpable act have you been guilty of
towards me what have you done to me what are your wrongs with regard
to me you accuse yourself you wish to be superseded 
turned out so it be then that is well i do not understand
javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resumed still
mr mayor six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman
i was furious and i informed against you
m madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than
as a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police
javert who had not raised his eyes went on
i thought it was so i had had an idea for a long time a resemblance
inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles the strength
of your loins the adventure with old fauchelevant your skill in
marksmanship your leg which you drag a little i hardly know what
all absurdities but at all events i took you for a certain jean
a certain what did you say the name was
jean valjean he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty
years ago when i was adjutant guard of convicts at toulon on leaving
the galleys this jean valjean as it appears robbed a bishop then he
committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public highway
on the person of a little savoyard he disappeared eight years ago no
one knows how and he has been sought i fancied in short i did this
thing wrath impelled me i denounced you at the prefecture
