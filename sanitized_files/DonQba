and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure but if
beauty be accompanied by want and penury then the ravens and the kites
and other birds of prey assail it and she who stands firm against such
attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband remember o
prudent basilio added don quixote it was the opinion of a certain
sage i know not whom that there was not more than one good woman in the
whole world and his advice was that each one should think and believe
that this one good woman was his own wife and in this way he would live
happy i myself am not married nor so far has it ever entered my
thoughts to be so nevertheless i would venture to give advice to anyone
who might ask it as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as
he would be content to marry the first thing i would recommend him
would be to look to good name rather than to wealth for a good woman
does not win a good name merely by being good but by letting it be seen
that she is so and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a
womans honour than secret depravity if you take a good woman into your
house it will be an easy matter to keep her good and even to make her
still better but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to
mend her for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to
another i do not say it is impossible but i look upon it as difficult
sancho listening to all this said to himself this master of mine
when i say anything that has weight and substance says i might take a
pulpit in hand and go about the world preaching fine sermons but i say
of him that when he begins stringing maxims together and giving advice
not only might he take a pulpit in hand but two on each finger and go
into the market places to his hearts content devil take you for a
knight errant what a lot of things you know i used to think in my heart
that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry but there
is nothing he wont have a finger in
sancho muttered this somewhat aloud and his master overheard him and
im not saying anything or muttering anything said sancho i was only
saying to myself that i wish i had heard what your worship has said just
now before i married perhaps id say now the ox thats loose licks
she is not very bad replied sancho but she is not very good at
least she is not as good as i could wish
thou dost wrong sancho said don quixote to speak ill of thy wife
for after all she is the mother of thy children we are quits
returned sancho for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into her
head especially when she is jealous and satan himself could not put up
in fine they remained three days with the newly married couple by whom
they were entertained and treated like kings don quixote begged the
fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of
montesinos as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own
eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country
were true the licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own a
famous scholar and one very much given to reading books of chivalry who
would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very
cave and would show him the lakes of ruidera which were likewise famous
all over la mancha and even all over spain and he assured him he would
find him entertaining for he was a youth who could write books good
enough to be printed and dedicated to princes the cousin arrived at
last leading an ass in foal with a pack saddle covered with a
parti coloured carpet or sackcloth sancho saddled rocinante got dapple
ready and stocked his alforjas along with which went those of the
cousin likewise well filled and so commending themselves to god and
bidding farewell to all they set out taking the road for the famous
on the way don quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his
pursuits avocations and studies were to which he replied that he was
by profession a humanist and that his pursuits and studies were making
books for the press all of great utility and no less entertainment to
the nation one was called the book of liveries in which he described
seven hundred and three liveries with their colours mottoes and
ciphers from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any they
fancied for festivals and revels without having to go a begging for them
from anyone or puzzling their brains as the saying is to have them
appropriate to their objects and purposes for said he i give the
jealous the rejected the forgotten the absent what will suit them
and fit them without fail i have another book too which i shall call
metamorphoses or the spanish ovid one of rare and original invention
for imitating ovid in burlesque style i show in it who the giralda of
seville and the angel of the magdalena were what the sewer of
vecinguerra at cordova was what the bulls of guisando the sierra
morena the leganitos and lavapies fountains at madrid not forgetting
those of the piojo of the cano dorado and of the priora and all with
their allegories metaphors and changes so that they are amusing
interesting and instructive all at once another book i have which i
call the supplement to polydore vergil which treats of the invention
of things and is a work of great erudition and research for i establish
and elucidate elegantly some things of great importance which polydore
omitted to mention he forgot to tell us who was the first man in the
world that had a cold in his head and who was the first to try
salivation for the french disease but i give it accurately set forth
and quote more than five and twenty authors in proof of it so you may
perceive i have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be of
sancho who had been very attentive to the cousins words said to him
tell me senor and god give you luck in printing your books can you
tell me for of course you know as you know everything who was the
first man that scratched his head for to my thinking it must have been
so it must replied the cousin for there is no doubt but adam had a
head and hair and being the first man in the world he would have
so i think said sancho but now tell me who was the first tumbler in
really brother answered the cousin i could not at this moment say
positively without having investigated it i will look it up when i go
back to where i have my books and will satisfy you the next time we
meet for this will not be the last time
look here senor said sancho dont give yourself any trouble about
it for i have just this minute hit upon what i asked you the first
tumbler in the world you must know was lucifer when they cast or
pitched him out of heaven for he came tumbling into the bottomless pit
you are right friend said the cousin and said don quixote sancho
that question and answer are not thine own thou hast heard them from
hold your peace senor said sancho faith if i take to asking
questions and answering ill go on from this till to morrow morning
nay to ask foolish things and answer nonsense i neednt go looking for
thou hast said more than thou art aware of sancho said don quixote
for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving
things that after they are known and proved are not worth a farthing to
in this and other pleasant conversation the day went by and that night
they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to
the cave of montesinos so the cousin told don quixote adding that if
he was bent upon entering it it would be requisite for him to provide
himself with ropes so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths
don quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant
to see where it went to so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope
and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave the mouth
of which is spacious and wide but full of thorn and wild fig bushes and
brambles and briars so thick and matted that they completely close it up
on coming within sight of it the cousin sancho and don quixote
dismounted and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly
with the ropes and as they were girding and swathing him sancho said to
him mind what you are about master mine dont go burying yourself
alive or putting yourself where youll be like a bottle put to cool in a
well its no affair or business of your worships to become the explorer
of this which must be worse than a moorish dungeon
tie me and hold thy peace said don quixote for an emprise like this
friend sancho was reserved for me and said the guide i beg of you
senor don quixote to observe carefully and examine with a hundred eyes
everything that is within there perhaps there may be some things for me
the drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough said
when he had said this and finished the tying which was not over the
armour but only over the doublet don quixote observed it was careless
of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle bell to be tied
on the rope close to me the sound of which would show that i was still
descending and alive but as that is out of the question now in gods
hand be it to guide me and forthwith he fell on his knees and in a low
voice offered up a prayer to heaven imploring god to aid him and grant
him success in this to all appearance perilous and untried adventure and
then exclaimed aloud o mistress of my actions and movements
illustrious and peerless dulcinea del toboso if so be the prayers and
supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears by thy
incomparable beauty i entreat thee to listen to them for they but ask
thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that i stand in such
need of them i am about to precipitate to sink to plunge myself into
the abyss that is here before me only to let the world know that while
thou dost favour me there is no impossibility i will not attempt and
accomplish with these words he approached the cavern and perceived
that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance except
by sheer force or cleaving a passage so drawing his sword he began to
demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave at the noise
of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so thick
and so fast that they knocked don quixote down and if he had been as
much of a believer in augury as he was a catholic christian he would have
taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place he
got up however and as there came no more crows or night birds like the
bats that flew out at the same time with the crows the cousin and sancho
giving him rope he lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern
and as he entered it sancho sent his blessing after him making a
thousand crosses over him and saying god and the pena de francia and
the trinity of gaeta guide thee flower and cream of knights errant
there thou goest thou dare devil of the earth heart of steel arm of
brass once more god guide thee and send thee back safe sound and
unhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the
darkness thou art seeking there and the cousin offered up almost the
don quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope and they
gave it out little by little and by the time the calls which came out
of the cave as out of a pipe ceased to be heard they had let down the
hundred fathoms of rope they were inclined to pull don quixote up again
as they could give him no more rope however they waited about half an
hour at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again
with great ease and without feeling any weight which made them fancy don
quixote was remaining below and persuaded that it was so sancho wept
bitterly and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question
when however they had come to as it seemed rather more than eighty
fathoms they felt a weight at which they were greatly delighted and at
last at ten fathoms more they saw don quixote distinctly and sancho
called out to him saying welcome back senor for we had begun to
think you were going to stop there to found a family but don quixote
answered not a word and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had
his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep
they stretched him on the ground and untied him but still he did not
awake however they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled
him about so that after some time he came to himself stretching himself
just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep and looking
about him he said god forgive you friends ye have taken me away from
the sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human
being enjoyed or beheld now indeed do i know that all the pleasures of
this life pass away like a shadow and a dream or fade like the flower of
the field o ill fated montesinos o sore wounded durandarte o unhappy
belerma o tearful guadiana and ye o hapless daughters of ruidera who
show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes
the cousin and sancho panza listened with deep attention to the words of
don quixote who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up
from his very bowels they begged of him to explain himself and tell
them what he had seen in that hell down there
hell do you call it said don quixote call it by no such name for it
does not deserve it as ye shall soon see
he then begged them to give him something to eat as he was very hungry
they spread the cousins sackcloth on the grass and put the stores of
the alforjas into requisition and all three sitting down lovingly and
sociably they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in one and when
the sackcloth was removed don quixote of la mancha said let no one
rise and attend to me my sons both of you
of the wonderful things the incomparable don quixote said he saw in the
profound cave of montesinos the impossibility and magnitude of which
it was about four in the afternoon when the sun veiled in clouds with
subdued light and tempered beams enabled don quixote to relate without
heat or inconvenience what he had seen in the cave of montesinos to his
two illustrious hearers and he began as follows
a matter of some twelve or fourteen times a mans height down in this
pit on the right hand side there is a recess or space roomy enough to
contain a large cart with its mules a little light reaches it through
some chinks or crevices communicating with it and open to the surface of
the earth this recess or space i perceived when i was already growing
weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope
travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or
knowledge of where i was going so i resolved to enter it and rest myself
for a while i called out telling you not to let out more rope until i
bade you but you cannot have heard me i then gathered in the rope you
were sending me and making a coil or pile of it i seated myself upon it
ruminating and considering what i was to do to lower myself to the
bottom having no one to hold me up and as i was thus deep in thought
and perplexity suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell
upon me and when i least expected it i know not how i awoke and found
myself in the midst of the most beautiful delightful meadow that nature
could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive i opened my
eyes i rubbed them and found i was not asleep but thoroughly awake
nevertheless i felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was
i myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom but touch
feeling the collected thoughts that passed through my mind all
convinced me that i was the same then and there that i am this moment
next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle
with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal and through
two great doors that opened wide therein i saw coming forth and
advancing towards me a venerable old man clad in a long gown of
mulberry coloured serge that trailed upon the ground on his shoulders
and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood and covering his head a
black milanese bonnet and his snow white beard fell below his girdle he
carried no arms whatever nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than
fair sized filberts each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg
his bearing his gait his dignity and imposing presence held me
spellbound and wondering he approached me and the first thing he did
was to embrace me closely and then he said to me for a long time now
o valiant knight don quixote of la mancha we who are here enchanted in
these solitudes have been hoping to see thee that thou mayest make known
to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave called the
cave of montesinos which thou hast entered an achievement reserved for
thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt come with
me illustrious sir and i will show thee the marvels hidden within this
transparent castle whereof i am the alcaide and perpetual warden for i
am montesinos himself from whom the cave takes its name
the instant he told me he was montesinos i asked him if the story they
told in the world above here was true that he had taken out the heart of
his great friend durandarte from his breast with a little dagger and
carried it to the lady belerma as his friend when at the point of death
had commanded him he said in reply that they spoke the truth in every
respect except as to the dagger for it was not a dagger nor little but
that poniard must have been made by ramon de hoces the sevillian said
i do not know said don quixote it could not have been by that
poniard maker however because ramon de hoces was a man of yesterday
and the affair of roncesvalles where this mishap occurred was long ago
but the question is of no great importance nor does it affect or make
any alteration in the truth or substance of the story
that is true said the cousin continue senor don quixote for i am
listening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world
and with no less do i tell the tale said don quixote and so to
proceed the venerable montesinos led me into the palace of crystal
where in a lower chamber strangely cool and entirely of alabaster was
an elaborately wrought marble tomb upon which i beheld stretched at
full length a knight not of bronze or marble or jasper as are seen
on other tombs but of actual flesh and bone his right hand which
seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy a sign of great strength in its
owner lay on the side of his heart but before i could put any question
to montesinos he seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement said to me
this is my friend durandarte flower and mirror of the true lovers and
valiant knights of his time he is held enchanted here as i myself and
many others are by that french enchanter merlin who they say was the
devils son but my belief is not that he was the devils son but that
he knew as the saying is a point more than the devil how or why he
enchanted us no one knows but time will tell and i suspect that time
is not far off what i marvel at is that i know it to be as sure as that
it is now day that durandarte ended his life in my arms and that after
his death i took out his heart with my own hands and indeed it must
have weighed more than two pounds for according to naturalists he who
has a large heart is more largely endowed with valour than he who has a
small one then as this is the case and as the knight did really die
how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time as if he were
as he said this the wretched durandarte cried out in a loud voice
on hearing which the venerable montesinos fell on his knees before the
unhappy knight and with tearful eyes exclaimed long since senor
durandarte my beloved cousin long since have i done what you bade me on
that sad day when i lost you i took out your heart as well as i could
not leaving an atom of it in your breast i wiped it with a lace
handkerchief and i took the road to france with it having first laid
you in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my
hands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels
and more by token o cousin of my soul at the first village i came to
after leaving roncesvalles i sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to
keep it sweet and bring it if not fresh at least pickled into the
presence of the lady belerma whom together with you myself guadiana
your squire the duenna ruidera and her seven daughters and two nieces
and many more of your friends and acquaintances the sage merlin has been
keeping enchanted here these many years and although more than five
hundred have gone by not one of us has died ruidera and her daughters
and nieces alone are missing and these because of the tears they shed
merlin out of the compassion he seems to have felt for them changed
into so many lakes which to this day in the world of the living and in
the province of la mancha are called the lakes of ruidera the seven
daughters belong to the kings of spain and the two nieces to the knights
of a very holy order called the order of st john guadiana your squire
likewise bewailing your fate was changed into a river of his own name
but when he came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven so
great was his grief at finding he was leaving you that he plunged into
the bowels of the earth however as he cannot help following his natural
course he from time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and
the world the lakes aforesaid send him their waters and with these and
others that come to him he makes a grand and imposing entrance into
portugal but for all that go where he may he shows his melancholy and
sadness and takes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish only coarse
and tasteless sorts very different from those of the golden tagus all
this that i tell you now o cousin mine i have told you many times
before and as you make no answer i fear that either you believe me not
or do not hear me whereat i feel god knows what grief i have now news
to give you which if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings will
not in any wise increase them know that you have here before you open
your eyes and you will see that great knight of whom the sage merlin has
prophesied such great things that don quixote of la mancha i mean who
has again and to better purpose than in past times revived in these
days knight errantry long since forgotten and by whose intervention and
aid it may be we shall be disenchanted for great deeds are reserved for
and if that may not be said the wretched durandarte in a low and
feeble voice if that may not be then my cousin i say patience and
shuffle and turning over on his side he relapsed into his former
and now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation accompanied by
deep sighs and bitter sobs i looked round and through the crystal wall
i saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of fair
damsels all clad in mourning and with white turbans of turkish fashion
on their heads behind in the rear of these there came a lady for so
from her dignity she seemed to be also clad in black with a white veil
so long and ample that it swept the ground her turban was twice as large
as the largest of any of the others her eyebrows met her nose was
rather flat her mouth was large but with ruddy lips and her teeth of
which at times she allowed a glimpse were seen to be sparse and ill set
though as white as peeled almonds she carried in her hands a fine cloth
and in it as well as i could make out a heart that had been mummied so
parched and dried was it montesinos told me that all those forming the
procession were the attendants of durandarte and belerma who were
enchanted there with their master and mistress and that the last she
who carried the heart in the cloth was the lady belerma who with her
damsels four days in the week went in procession singing or rather
weeping dirges over the body and miserable heart of his cousin and that
if she appeared to me somewhat ill favoured or not so beautiful as fame
reported her it was because of the bad nights and worse days that she
passed in that enchantment as i could see by the great dark circles
round her eyes and her sickly complexion her sallowness and the rings
round her eyes said he are not caused by the periodical ailment usual
with women for it is many months and even years since she has had any
but by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in
her hand perpetually and which recalls and brings back to her memory the
sad fate of her lost lover were it not for this hardly would the great
dulcinea del toboso so celebrated in all these parts and even in the
world come up to her for beauty grace and gaiety
hold hard said i at this tell your story as you ought senor don
montesinos for you know very well that all comparisons are odious and
there is no occasion to compare one person with another the peerless
dulcinea del toboso is what she is and the lady dona belerma is what she
is and has been and thats enough to which he made answer forgive
me senor don quixote i own i was wrong and spoke unadvisedly in saying
that the lady dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady belerma for it
were enough for me to have learned by what means i know not that you
are her knight to make me bite my tongue out before i compared her to
anything save heaven itself after this apology which the great
montesinos made me my heart recovered itself from the shock i had
received in hearing my lady compared with belerma
still i wonder said sancho that your worship did not get upon the
old fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks and pluck his beard
until you didnt leave a hair in it
nay sancho my friend said don quixote it would not have been right
in me to do that for we are all bound to pay respect to the aged even
though they be not knights but especially to those who are and who are
enchanted i only know i gave him as good as he brought in the many other
i cannot understand senor don quixote remarked the cousin here how
it is that your worship in such a short space of time as you have been
below there could have seen so many things and said and answered so
how long is it since i went down asked don quixote
that cannot be returned don quixote because night overtook me while
i was there and day came and it was night again and day again three
times so that by my reckoning i have been three days in those remote
my master must be right replied sancho for as everything that has
happened to him is by enchantment maybe what seems to us an hour would
and did your worship eat anything all that time senor asked the
i never touched a morsel answered don quixote nor did i feel hunger
and do the enchanted eat said the cousin
they neither eat said don quixote nor are they subject to the
greater excrements though it is thought that their nails beards and
and do the enchanted sleep now senor asked sancho
certainly not replied don quixote at least during those three days
i was with them not one of them closed an eye nor did i either
the proverb tell me what company thou keepest and ill tell thee what
thou art is to the point here said sancho your worship keeps
company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching what
wonder is it then that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with
them but forgive me senor if i say that of all this you have told us
now may god take me i was just going to say the devil if i believe a
what said the cousin has senor don quixote then been lying why
even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together such
i dont believe my master lies said sancho
if not what dost thou believe asked don quixote
i believe replied sancho that this merlin or those enchanters who
enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with
down there stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole
you have been treating us to and all that is still to come
all that might be sancho replied don quixote but it is not so for
everything that i have told you i saw with my own eyes and touched with
my own hands but what will you say when i tell you now how among the
countless other marvellous things montesinos showed me of which at
leisure and at the proper time i will give thee an account in the course
of our journey for they would not be all in place here he showed me
three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the
pleasant fields there and the instant i beheld them i knew one to be the
peerless dulcinea del toboso and the other two those same country girls
that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from el toboso i
asked montesinos if he knew them and he told me he did not but he
thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction for it was
only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those
meadows but i was not to be surprised at that because there were a
great many other ladies there of times past and present enchanted in
various strange shapes and among them he had recognised queen guinevere
and her dame quintanona she who poured out the wine for lancelot when he
when sancho panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of
his senses or die with laughter for as he knew the real truth about
the pretended enchantment of dulcinea in which he himself had been the
enchanter and concocter of all the evidence he made up his mind at last
that beyond all doubt his master was out of his wits and stark mad so
he said to him it was an evil hour a worse season and a sorrowful
day when your worship dear master mine went down to the other world
and an unlucky moment when you met with senor montesinos who has sent
you back to us like this you were well enough here above in your full
senses such as god had given you delivering maxims and giving advice at
every turn and not as you are now talking the greatest nonsense that
as i know thee sancho said don quixote i heed not thy words
nor i your worships said sancho whether you beat me or kill me for
those i have spoken and will speak if you dont correct and mend your
own but tell me while we are still at peace how or by what did you
recognise the lady our mistress and if you spoke to her what did you
i recognised her said don quixote by her wearing the same garments
she wore when thou didst point her out to me i spoke to her but she did
not utter a word in reply on the contrary she turned her back on me and
took to flight at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have
overtaken her i wished to follow her and would have done so had not
montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless
particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for
me to quit the cavern he told me moreover that in course of time he
would let me know how he and belerma and durandarte and all who were
there were to be disenchanted but of all i saw and observed down there
what gave me most pain was that while montesinos was speaking to me one
of the two companions of the hapless dulcinea approached me on one
without my having seen her coming and with tears in her eyes said to me
in a low agitated voice my lady dulcinea del toboso kisses your
worships hands and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her
know how you are and being in great need she also entreats your
worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen
reals or as much as you may have about you on this new dimity petticoat
that i have here and she promises to repay them very speedily i was
amazed and taken aback by such a message and turning to senor montesinos
i asked him is it possible senor montesinos that persons of
distinction under enchantment can be in need to which he replied
believe me senor don quixote that which is called need is to be met
with everywhere and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone and
does not spare even the enchanted and as the lady dulcinea del toboso
sends to beg those six reals and the pledge is to all appearance a good
one there is nothing for it but to give them to her for no doubt she
must be in some great strait i will take no pledge of her i replied
nor yet can i give her what she asks for all i have is four reals
which i gave they were those which thou sancho gavest me the other day
to bestow in alms upon the poor i met along the road and i said tell
your mistress my dear that i am grieved to the heart because of her
distresses and wish i was a fucar to remedy them and that i would have
her know that i cannot be and ought not be in health while deprived of
the happiness of seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation and
that i implore her as earnestly as i can to allow herself to be seen and
addressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight tell her too
that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that i have
made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the marquis of
mantua made to avenge his nephew baldwin when he found him at the point
of death in the heart of the mountains which was not to eat bread off a
tablecloth and other trifling matters which he added until he had
avenged him and i will make the same to take no rest and to roam the
seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the infante don pedro of
portugal ever roamed them until i have disenchanted her all that and
more you owe my lady the damsels answer to me and taking the four
reals instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper springing two full
o blessed god exclaimed sancho aloud at this is it possible that
such things can be in the world and that enchanters and enchantments can
have such power in it as to have changed my masters right senses into a
craze so full of absurdity o senor senor for gods sake consider
yourself have a care for your honour and give no credit to this silly
stuff that has left you scant and short of wits
thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me sancho said don
quixote and not being experienced in the things of the world
everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible
but time will pass as i said before and i will tell thee some of the
things i saw down there which will make thee believe what i have related
now the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question
wherein are related a thousand trifling matters as trivial as they are
necessary to the right understanding of this great history
he who translated this great history from the original written by its
first author cide hamete benengeli says that on coming to the chapter
giving the adventures of the cave of montesinos he found written on the
margin of it in hametes own hand these exact words
i cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in
the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant don
quixote and for this reason that all the adventures that have occurred
up to the present have been possible and probable but as for this one of
the cave i see no way of accepting it as true as it passes all
reasonable bounds for me to believe that don quixote could lie he being
the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time is
impossible he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death
with arrows on the other hand i reflect that he related and told the
story with all the circumstances detailed and that he could not in so
short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities
if then this adventure seems apocryphal it is no fault of mine and
so without affirming its falsehood or its truth i write it down decide
for thyself in thy wisdom reader for i am not bound nor is it in my
power to do more though certain it is they say that at the time of his
death he retracted and said he had invented it thinking it matched and
tallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories and then he
the cousin was amazed as well at sanchos boldness as at the patience of
his master and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose
from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady dulcinea even
enchanted as she was because otherwise the words and language sancho had
addressed to him deserved a thrashing for indeed he seemed to him to
have been rather impudent to his master to whom he now observed i
senor don quixote of la mancha look upon the time i have spent in
travelling with your worship as very well employed for i have gained
four things in the course of it the first is that i have made your
acquaintance which i consider great good fortune the second that i
have learned what the cave of montesinos contains together with the
transformations of guadiana and of the lakes of ruidera which will be of
use to me for the spanish ovid that i have in hand the third to have
discovered the antiquity of cards that they were in use at least in the
time of charlemagne as may be inferred from the words you say durandarte
uttered when at the end of that long spell while montesinos was talking
to him he woke up and said patience and shuffle this phrase and
expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted but only
before he had become so in france and in the time of the aforesaid
emperor charlemagne and this demonstration is just the thing for me for
that other book i am writing the supplement to polydore vergil on the
invention of antiquities for i believe he never thought of inserting
that of cards in his book as i mean to do in mine and it will be a
matter of great importance particularly when i can cite so grave and
veracious an authority as senor durandarte and the fourth thing is that
i have ascertained the source of the river guadiana heretofore unknown
you are right said don quixote but i should like to know if by
gods favour they grant you a licence to print those books of yours which
i doubt to whom do you mean dedicate them
there are lords and grandees in spain to whom they can be dedicated
not many said don quixote not that they are unworthy of it but
because they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of
making the return that seems due to the authors labour and courtesy one
prince i know who makes up for all the rest and more how much more if i
ventured to say perhaps i should stir up envy in many a noble breast
but let this stand over for some more convenient time and let us go and
look for some place to shelter ourselves in to night
not far from this said the cousin there is a hermitage where there
lives a hermit who they say was a soldier and who has the reputation of
being a good christian and a very intelligent and charitable man close
to the hermitage he has a small house which he built at his own cost but
though small it is large enough for the reception of guests
has this hermit any hens do you think asked sancho
few hermits are without them said don quixote for those we see
now a days are not like the hermits of the egyptian deserts who were clad
in palm leaves and lived on the roots of the earth but do not think
that by praising these i am disparaging the others all i mean to say is
that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to the
asceticism and austerity of former times but it does not follow from
this that they are not all worthy at least i think them so and at the
worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open
at this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on
foot proceeding at a rapid pace and beating a mule loaded with lances
and halberds when he came up to them he saluted them and passed on
without stopping don quixote called to him stay good fellow you seem
to be making more haste than suits that mule
i cannot stop senor answered the man for the arms you see i carry
here are to be used tomorrow so i must not delay god be with you but
if you want to know what i am carrying them for i mean to lodge to night
at the inn that is beyond the hermitage and if you be going the same
road you will find me there and i will tell you some curious things
once more god be with you and he urged on his mule at such a pace that
don quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things were that he
meant to tell them and as he was somewhat inquisitive and always
tortured by his anxiety to learn something new he decided to set out at
once and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the
hermitage where the cousin would have had them halt accordingly they
mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn which they
reached a little before nightfall on the road the cousin proposed they
should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup the instant sancho heard
this he steered his dapple towards it and don quixote and the cousin did
the same but it seems sanchos bad luck so ordered it that the hermit
was not at home for so a sub hermit they found in the hermitage told
them they called for some of the best she replied that her master had
none but that if they liked cheap water she would give it with great
if i found any in water said sancho there are wells along the road
where i could have had enough of it ah camachos wedding and plentiful
house of don diego how often do i miss you
leaving the hermitage they pushed on towards the inn and a little
farther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at
no great speed so that they overtook him he carried a sword over his
shoulder and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently
probably his breeches or pantaloons and his cloak and a shirt or two
for he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in
places and had his shirt out his stockings were of silk and his shoes
square toed as they wear them at court his age might have been eighteen
or nineteen he was of a merry countenance and to all appearance of an
active habit and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the
wearisomeness of the road as they came up with him he was just finishing
one which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus
the first to address him was don quixote who said you travel very
airily sir gallant whither bound may we ask if it is your pleasure to
to which the youth replied the heat and my poverty are the reason of my
travelling so airily and it is to the wars that i am bound
how poverty asked don quixote the heat one can understand
senor replied the youth in this bundle i carry velvet pantaloons to
match this jacket if i wear them out on the road i shall not be able to
make a decent appearance in them in the city and i have not the
wherewithal to buy others and so for this reason as well as to keep
myself cool i am making my way in this fashion to overtake some
companies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off in which i shall
enlist and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with after
that to the place of embarkation which they say will be carthagena i
would rather have the king for a master and serve him in the wars than
and did you get any bounty now asked the cousin
if i had been in the service of some grandee of spain or personage of
distinction replied the youth i should have been safe to get it for
that is the advantage of serving good masters that out of the servants
hall men come to be ancients or captains or get a good pension but i
to my misfortune always served place hunters and adventurers whose keep
and wages were so miserable and scanty that half went in paying for the
starching of ones collars it would be a miracle indeed if a page
volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty
and tell me for heavens sake asked don quixote is it possible my
friend that all the time you served you never got any livery
they gave me two replied the page but just as when one quits a
religious community before making profession they strip him of the dress
of the order and give him back his own clothes so did my masters return
me mine for as soon as the business on which they came to court was
finished they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely
what spilorceria as an italian would say said don quixote but for
all that consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an
object as you have for there is nothing on earth more honourable or
profitable than serving first of all god and then ones king and
natural lord particularly in the profession of arms by which if not
more wealth at least more honour is to be won than by letters as i have
said many a time for though letters may have founded more great houses
than arms still those founded by arms have i know not what superiority
over those founded by letters and a certain splendour belonging to them
that distinguishes them above all and bear in mind what i am now about
to say to you for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of
trouble it is not to let your mind dwell on the adverse chances that
may befall you for the worst of all is death and if it be a good death
the best of all is to die they asked julius caesar the valiant roman
emperor what was the best death he answered that which is unexpected
which comes suddenly and unforeseen and though he answered like a pagan
and one without the knowledge of the true god yet as far as sparing our
feelings is concerned he was right for suppose you are killed in the
first engagement or skirmish whether by a cannon ball or blown up by
mine what matters it it is only dying and all is over and according
to terence a soldier shows better dead in battle than alive and safe in
flight and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to
his captains and those in command over him and remember my son that it
is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet and that
if old age should come upon you in this honourable calling though you
may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame it will not come upon
you without honour and that such as poverty cannot lessen especially
now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and
disabled soldiers for it is not right to deal with them after the
fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they
are old and useless and turning them out of their houses under the
pretence of making them free make them slaves to hunger from which they
cannot expect to be released except by death but for the present i wont
say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as the inn and sup
with me there and to morrow you shall pursue your journey and god give
you as good speed as your intentions deserve
the page did not accept the invitation to mount though he did that to
supper at the inn and here they say sancho said to himself god be with
you for a master is it possible that a man who can say things so many
and so good as he has said just now can say that he saw the impossible
absurdities he reports about the cave of montesinos well well we shall
and now just as night was falling they reached the inn and it was not
without satisfaction that sancho perceived his master took it for a real
inn and not for a castle as usual the instant they entered don quixote
asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds and was
told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule which was what sancho
and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts giving the best manger
and the best place in the stable to rocinante
wherein is set down the braying adventure and the droll one of the
puppet showman together with the memorable divinations of the divining
don quixotes bread would not bake as the common saying is until he had
heard and learned the curious things promised by the man who carried the
arms he went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was and having
found him bade him say now at any rate what he had to say in answer to
the question he had asked him on the road the tale of my wonders must
be taken more leisurely and not standing said the man let me finish
foddering my beast good sir and then ill tell you things that will
dont wait for that said don quixote ill help you in everything
and so he did sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger a
degree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with a
good grace what he had asked so seating himself on a bench with don
quixote beside him and the cousin the page sancho panza and the
landlord for a senate and an audience he began his story in this way
you must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn
it so happened that one of the regidors by the tricks and roguery of a
servant girl of his its too long a tale to tell lost an ass and
though he did all he possibly could to find it it was all to no purpose
a fortnight might have gone by so the story goes since the ass had been
missing when as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the plaza
another regidor of the same town said to him pay me for good news
gossip your ass has turned up that i will and well gossip said
the other but tell us where has he turned up in the forest said
the finder i saw him this morning without pack saddle or harness of any
sort and so lean that it went to ones heart to see him i tried to
drive him before me and bring him to you but he is already so wild and
shy that when i went near him he made off into the thickest part of the
forest if you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him
let me put up this she ass at my house and ill be back at once you
will be doing me a great kindness said the owner of the ass and ill
try to pay it back in the same coin it is with all these circumstances
and in the very same way i am telling it now that those who know all
about the matter tell the story well then the two regidors set off on
foot arm in arm for the forest and coming to the place where they
hoped to find the ass they could not find him nor was he to be seen
anywhere about search as they might seeing then that there was no
sign of him the regidor who had seen him said to the other look here
gossip a plan has occurred to me by which beyond a doubt we shall
manage to discover the animal even if he is stowed away in the bowels of
the earth not to say the forest here it is i can bray to perfection
and if you can ever so little the things as good as done ever so
little did you say gossip said the other by god ill not give in to
anybody not even to the asses themselves well soon see said the
second regidor for my plan is that you should go one side of the
forest and i the other so as to go all round about it and every now
and then you will bray and i will bray and it cannot be but that the ass
will hear us and answer us if he is in the forest to which the owner
of the ass replied its an excellent plan i declare gossip and
worthy of your great genius and the two separating as agreed it so
fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment and each deceived
by the braying of the other ran to look fancying the ass had turned up
at last when they came in sight of one another said the loser is it
possible gossip that it was not my ass that brayed no it was i
said the other well then i can tell you gossip said the asss
owner that between you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as
far as braying goes for i never in all my life saw or heard anything
more natural those praises and compliments belong to you more justly
than to me gossip said the inventor of the plan for by the god that
made me you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most
finished brayer in the world the tone you have got is deep your voice
is well kept up as to time and pitch and your finishing notes come thick
and fast in fact i own myself beaten and yield the palm to you and
give in to you in this rare accomplishment well then said the owner
ill set a higher value on myself for the future and consider that i
know something as i have an excellence of some sort for though i always
thought i brayed well i never supposed i came up to the pitch of
perfection you say and i say too said the second that there are
rare gifts going to loss in the world and that they are ill bestowed
upon those who dont know how to make use of them ours said the
owner of the ass unless it is in cases like this we have now in hand
cannot be of any service to us and even in this god grant they may be of
some use so saying they separated and took to their braying once more
but every instant they were deceiving one another and coming to meet one
another again until they arranged by way of countersign so as to know
that it was they and not the ass to give two brays one after the other
in this way doubling the brays at every step they made the complete
circuit of the forest but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even
the sign of one how could the poor ill starred brute have answered
when in the thickest part of the forest they found him devoured by
wolves as soon as he saw him his owner said i was wondering he did not
answer for if he wasnt dead hed have brayed when he heard us or hed
have been no ass but for the sake of having heard you bray to such
perfection gossip i count the trouble i have taken to look for him well
bestowed even though i have found him dead its in a good hand
gossip said the other if the abbot sings well the acolyte is not
much behind him so they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their
village where they told their friends neighbours and acquaintances
what had befallen them in their search for the ass each crying up the
others perfection in braying the whole story came to be known and
spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood and the devil
who never sleeps with his love for sowing dissensions and scattering
discord everywhere blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of
nothing contrived to make the people of the other towns fall to braying
whenever they saw anyone from our village as if to throw the braying of
our regidors in our teeth then the boys took to it which was the same
thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of
hell and braying spread from one town to another in such a way that the
men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known
from whites and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the
scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the
scoffers and neither king nor rook fear nor shame can mend matters
to morrow or the day after i believe the men of my town that is of
the braying town are going to take the field against another village two
leagues away from ours one of those that persecute us most and that we
may turn out well prepared i have bought these lances and halberds you
have seen these are the curious things i told you i had to tell and if
you dont think them so i have got no others and with this the worthy
just at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirely
clad in chamois leather hose breeches and doublet who said in a loud
voice senor host have you room heres the divining ape and the show
ods body said the landlord why its master pedro were in for a
grand night i forgot to mention that the said master pedro had his left
eye and nearly half his cheek covered with a patch of green taffety
showing that something ailed all that side your worship is welcome
master pedro continued the landlord but where are the ape and the
show for i dont see them they are close at hand said he in the
chamois leather but i came on first to know if there was any room
id make the duke of alva himself clear out to make room for master
pedro said the landlord bring in the ape and the show theres
company in the inn to night that will pay to see that and the cleverness
of the ape so be it by all means said the man with the patch ill
lower the price and be well satisfied if i only pay my expenses and now
ill go back and hurry on the cart with the ape and the show and with
don quixote at once asked the landlord what this master pedro was and
what was the show and what was the ape he had with him which the
