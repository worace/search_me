such a favour as that which you by the sight of your great beauty have
granted me but fortune which is never weary of persecuting the good
has chosen to place me upon this bed where i lie so bruised and broken
that though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is
impossible besides to this impossibility another yet greater is to be
added which is the faith that i have pledged to the peerless dulcinea
del toboso sole lady of my most secret thoughts and were it not that
this stood in the way i should not be so insensible a knight as to miss
the happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me
maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by
don quixote and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to
her she strove without speaking to free herself the worthy carrier
whose unholy thoughts kept him awake was aware of his doxy the moment
she entered the door and was listening attentively to all don quixote
said and jealous that the asturian should have broken her word with him
for another drew nearer to don quixotes bed and stood still to see what
would come of this talk which he could not understand but when he
perceived the wench struggling to get free and don quixote striving to
hold her not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a
terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all
his mouth in blood and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and
with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot
the bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet unable to
support the additional weight of the carrier came to the ground and at
the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that
it must be some brawl of maritornes because after calling loudly to her
he got no answer with this suspicion he got up and lighting a lamp
hastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance the wench
seeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was
terrible frightened and panic stricken made for the bed of sancho panza
who still slept and crouching upon it made a ball of herself
the innkeeper came in exclaiming where art thou strumpet of course
this is some of thy work at this sancho awoke and feeling this mass
almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute
fisticuffs all round of which a certain share fell upon maritornes who
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside paid back so many in
return to sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself he then
finding himself so handled by whom he knew not raising himself up as
well as he could grappled with maritornes and he and she between them
began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world the carrier
however perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared
with his ladylove quitting don quixote ran to bring her the help she
needed and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention
for his was to chastise the lass as he believed that beyond a doubt she
alone was the cause of all the harmony and so as the saying is cat to
rat rat to rope rope to stick the carrier pounded sancho sancho the
lass she him and the innkeeper her and all worked away so briskly that
they did not give themselves a moments rest and the best of it was that
the innkeepers lamp went out and as they were left in the dark they all
laid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a
sound spot left where a hand could light
it so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero
of what they call the old holy brotherhood of toledo who also hearing
the extraordinary noise of the conflict seized his staff and the tin
case with his warrants and made his way in the dark into the room
crying hold in the name of the jurisdiction hold in the name of the
the first that he came upon was the pummelled don quixote who lay
stretched senseless on his back upon his broken down bed and his hand
falling on the beard as he felt about he continued to cry help for the
jurisdiction but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not
move or stir he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room
were his murderers and with this suspicion he raised his voice still
higher calling out shut the inn gate see that no one goes out they
have killed a man here this cry startled them all and each dropped the
contest at the point at which the voice reached him the innkeeper
retreated to his room the carrier to his pack saddles the lass to her
crib the unlucky don quixote and sancho alone were unable to move from
where they were the cuadrillero on this let go don quixotes beard and
went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits
but not finding one as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the
lantern on retreating to his room he was compelled to have recourse to
the hearth where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp
in which are contained the innumerable troubles which the brave don
quixote and his good squire sancho panza endured in the inn which to his
by this time don quixote had recovered from his swoon and in the same
tone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when he
lay stretched in the vale of the stakes he began calling to him now
sancho my friend art thou asleep sleepest thou friend sancho
how can i sleep curses on it returned sancho discontentedly and
bitterly when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this
thou mayest well believe that answered don quixote because either i
know little or this castle is enchanted for thou must know but this
that i am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyones
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till
the end of your worships days and god grant i may be able to let it out
do i do thee such injuries sancho said don quixote that thou
it is not for that replied sancho but because i hate keeping things
long and i dont want them to grow rotten with me from over keeping
at any rate said don quixote i have more confidence in thy affection
and good nature and so i would have thee know that this night there
befell me one of the strangest adventures that i could describe and to
relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the
daughter of the lord of this castle came to me and that she is the most
elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world what
i could tell thee of the charms of her person of her lively wit of
other secret matters which to preserve the fealty i owe to my lady
dulcinea del toboso i shall pass over unnoticed and in silence i will
only tell thee that either fate being envious of so great a boon placed
in my hands by good fortune or perhaps and this is more probable this
castle being as i have already said enchanted at the time when i was
engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her there came
without my seeing or knowing whence it came a hand attached to some arm
of some huge giant that planted such a cuff on my jaws that i have them
all bathed in blood and then pummelled me in such a way that i am in a
worse plight than yesterday when the carriers on account of rocinantes
misbehaviour inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of whence
conjecture that there must be some enchanted moor guarding the treasure
of this damsels beauty and that it is not for me
not for me either said sancho for more than four hundred moors have
so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy bread
to it but tell me senor what do you call this excellent and rare
adventure that has left us as we are left now though your worship was
not so badly off having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke
of but i what did i have except the heaviest whacks i think i had in
all my life unlucky me and the mother that bore me for i am not a
knight errant and never expect to be one and of all the mishaps the
then thou hast been thrashed too said don quixote
didnt i say so worse luck to my line said sancho
be not distressed friend said don quixote for i will now make the
precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an
by this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp and came
in to see the man that he thought had been killed and as sancho caught
sight of him at the door seeing him coming in his shirt with a cloth on
his head and a lamp in his hand and a very forbidding countenance he
said to his master senor can it be that this is the enchanted moor
coming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left
it cannot be the moor answered don quixote for those under
enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
if they dont let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said
sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point
mine could speak too said don quixote but that is not a sufficient
reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted moor
the officer came up and finding them engaged in such a peaceful
conversation stood amazed though don quixote to be sure still lay on
his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters the officer
turned to him and said well how goes it good man
i would speak more politely if i were you replied don quixote is it
the way of this country to address knights errant in that style you
the cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a
sorry looking individual lost his temper and raising the lamp full of
oil smote don quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a
badly broken pate then all being in darkness he went out and sancho
panza said that is certainly the enchanted moor senor and he keeps
the treasure for others and for us only the cuffs and lamp whacks
that is the truth answered don quixote and there is no use in
troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or
vexed at them for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no
one on whom to avenge ourselves do what we may rise sancho if thou
canst and call the alcaide of this fortress and get him to give me a
little oil wine salt and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam for
indeed i believe i have great need of it now because i am losing much
blood from the wound that phantom gave me
sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the innkeeper
in the dark and meeting the officer who was looking to see what had
become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us the
favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and wine
for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights errant on earth who
lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted moor that is in
when the officer heard him talk in this way he took him for a man out of
his senses and as day was now beginning to break he opened the inn
gate and calling the host he told him what this good man wanted the
host furnished him with what he required and sancho brought it to don
quixote who with his hand to his head was bewailing the pain of the
blow of the lamp which had done him no more harm than raising a couple
of rather large lumps and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that
flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm to be brief he
took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and
boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to
perfection he then asked for some vial to pour it into and as there was
not one in the inn he decided on putting it into a tin oil bottle or
flask of which the host made him a free gift and over the flask he
repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave marias
salves and credos accompanying each word with a cross by way of
benediction at all which there were present sancho the innkeeper and
the cuadrillero for the carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending
this being accomplished he felt anxious to make trial himself on the
spot of the virtue of this precious balsam as he considered it and so
he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and
remained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled but scarcely had he
done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left
in his stomach and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a
profuse sweat on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave
him alone they did so and he lay sleeping more than three hours at the
end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease
from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured and verily believed
he had hit upon the balsam of fierabras and that with this remedy he
might thenceforward without any fear face any kind of destruction
battle or combat however perilous it might be
sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as
miraculous begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin which
was no small quantity don quixote consented and he taking it with both
hands in good faith and with a better will gulped down and drained off
very little less than his master but the fact is that the stomach of
poor sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master and
so before vomiting he was seized with such gripings and retchings and
such sweats and faintness that verily and truly be believed his last
hour had come and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the
balsam and the thief that had given it to him
don quixote seeing him in this state said it is my belief sancho that
this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight for i am persuaded
this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so
if your worship knew that returned sancho woe betide me and all my
kindred why did you let me taste it
at this moment the draught took effect and the poor squire began to
discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had
thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for
nothing afterwards he sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and
convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had
come this tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours at the end of
which he was left not like his master but so weak and exhausted that he
could not stand don quixote however who as has been said felt
himself relieved and well was eager to take his departure at once in
quest of adventures as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered
there was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his
help and protection all the more when he had the security and confidence
his balsam afforded him and so urged by this impulse he saddled
rocinante himself and put the pack saddle on his squires beast whom
likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass after which he mounted his
horse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that
stood there to serve him by way of a lance all that were in the inn
who were more than twenty persons stood watching him the innkeepers
daughter was likewise observing him and he too never took his eyes off
her and from time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from
the depths of his bowels but they all thought it must be from the pain
he felt in his ribs at any rate they who had seen him plastered the
as soon as they were both mounted at the gate of the inn he called to
the host and said in a very grave and measured voice many and great are
the favours senor alcaide that i have received in this castle of yours
and i remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them
all the days of my life if i can repay them in avenging you of any
arrogant foe who may have wronged you know that my calling is no other
than to aid the weak to avenge those who suffer wrong and to chastise
perfidy search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you
need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood
which i have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the
the innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness sir knight i do not
want your worship to avenge me of any wrong because when any is done me
i can take what vengeance seems good to me the only thing i want is that
you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night as well
for the straw and barley for your two beasts as for supper and beds
then this is an inn said don quixote
and a very respectable one said the innkeeper
i have been under a mistake all this time answered don quixote for
in truth i thought it was a castle and not a bad one but since it
appears that it is not a castle but an inn all that can be done now is
that you should excuse the payment for i cannot contravene the rule of
knights errant of whom i know as a fact and up to the present i have
read nothing to the contrary that they never paid for lodging or
anything else in the inn where they might be for any hospitality that
might be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the
insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day
in summer and in winter on foot and on horseback in hunger and thirst
cold and heat exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the
i have little to do with that replied the innkeeper pay me what you
owe me and let us have no more talk of chivalry for all i care about is
you are a stupid scurvy innkeeper said don quixote and putting spurs
to rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn
before anyone could stop him and pushed on some distance without looking
to see if his squire was following him
the innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of
sancho who said that as his master would not pay neither would he
because being as he was squire to a knight errant the same rule and
reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying
anything in inns and hostelries at this the innkeeper waxed very wroth
and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he would not
like to which sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his master
had received he would not pay a rap though it cost him his life for the
excellent and ancient usage of knights errant was not going to be
violated by him nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into
the world ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a
the ill luck of the unfortunate sancho so ordered it that among the
company in the inn there were four woolcarders from segovia three
needle makers from the colt of cordova and two lodgers from the fair of
seville lively fellows tender hearted fond of a joke and playful
who almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse made up to
sancho and dismounted him from his ass while one of them went in for the
blanket of the hosts bed but on flinging him into it they looked up
and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower what they required for
their work they decided upon going out into the yard which was bounded
by the sky and there putting sancho in the middle of the blanket they
began to raise him high making sport with him as they would with a dog
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the
ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded
that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it
was his squire who uttered them wheeling about he came up to the inn
with a laborious gallop and finding it shut went round it to see if he
could find some way of getting in but as soon as he came to the wall of
the yard which was not very high he discovered the game that was being
played with his squire he saw him rising and falling in the air with
such grace and nimbleness that had his rage allowed him it is my belief
he would have laughed he tried to climb from his horse on to the top of
the wall but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even
dismount and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such
maledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing sancho as
it would be impossible to write down accurately they however did not
stay their laughter or their work for this nor did the flying sancho
cease his lamentations mingled now with threats now with entreaties but
all to little purpose or none at all until from pure weariness they
left off they then brought him his ass and mounting him on top of it
they put his jacket round him and the compassionate maritornes seeing
him so exhausted thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water and
that it might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well sancho took
it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of
his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drink it not my
son for it will kill thee see here i have the blessed balsam and he
held up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt
at these words sancho turned his eyes asquint and in a still louder
voice said can it be your worship has forgotten that i am not a knight
or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels i have left after
last night keep your liquor in the name of all the devils and leave me
to myself and at one and the same instant he left off talking and began
drinking but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did not
care to go on with it and begged maritornes to fetch him some wine
which she did with right good will and paid for it with her own money
for indeed they say of her that though she was in that line of life
there was some faint and distant resemblance to a christian about her
when sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass and the gate
of the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having
paid nothing and carried his point though it had been at the expense of
his usual sureties his shoulders it is true that the innkeeper detained
his alforjas in payment of what was owing to him but sancho took his
departure in such a flurry that he never missed them the innkeeper as
soon as he saw him off wanted to bar the gate close but the blanketers
would not agree to it for they were fellows who would not have cared two
farthings for don quixote even had he been really one of the
in which is related the discourse sancho panza held with his master don
sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his
beast when don quixote saw the state he was in he said i have now come
to the conclusion good sancho that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt
enchanted because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with
thee what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world and i
hold this confirmed by having noticed that when i was by the wall of the
yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy it was out of my power to
mount upon it nor could i even dismount from rocinante because they no
doubt had me enchanted for i swear to thee by the faith of what i am
that if i had been able to climb up or dismount i would have avenged
thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered
their freak for ever even though in so doing i knew that i contravened
the laws of chivalry which as i have often told thee do not permit a
knight to lay hands on him who is not one save in case of urgent and
great necessity in defence of his own life and person
i would have avenged myself too if i could said sancho whether i had
been dubbed knight or not but i could not though for my part i am
persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or
enchanted men as your worship says but men of flesh and bone like
ourselves and they all had their names for i heard them name them when
they were tossing me and one was called pedro martinez and another
tenorio hernandez and the innkeeper i heard was called juan palomeque
the left handed so that senor your not being able to leap over the
wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else
besides enchantments and what i make out clearly from all this is that
these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such
misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot and that
the best and wisest thing according to my small wits would be for us to
return home now that it is harvest time and attend to our business and
give over wandering from zeca to mecca and from pail to bucket as the
how little thou knowest about chivalry sancho replied don quixote
hold thy peace and have patience the day will come when thou shalt see
with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the
pursuit of this calling nay tell me what greater pleasure can there be
in the world or what delight can equal that of winning a battle and
triumphing over ones enemy none beyond all doubt
very likely answered sancho though i do not know it all i know is
that since we have been knights errant or since your worship has been
one for i have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number
we have never won any battle except the one with the biscayan and even
out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the
less and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more
cudgellings cuffs and more cuffs i getting the blanketing over and
above and falling in with enchanted persons on whom i cannot avenge
myself so as to know what the delight as your worship calls it of
that is what vexes me and what ought to vex thee sancho replied don
quixote but henceforward i will endeavour to have at hand some sword
made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him
who carries it and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me
that which belonged to amadis when he was called the knight of the
burning sword which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the
world possessed for besides having the said virtue it cut like a
razor and there was no armour however strong and enchanted it might be
such is my luck said sancho that even if that happened and your
worship found some such sword it would like the balsam turn out
serviceable and good for dubbed knights only and as for the squires
fear not that sancho said don quixote heaven will deal better by
thus talking don quixote and his squire were going along when on the
road they were following don quixote perceived approaching them a large
and thick cloud of dust on seeing which he turned to sancho and said
this is the day sancho on which will be seen the boon my fortune is
reserving for me this i say is the day on which as much as on any
other shall be displayed the might of my arm and on which i shall do
deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come
seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder well then all that is
churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that
according to that there must be two said sancho for on this opposite
side also there rises just such another cloud of dust
don quixote turned to look and found that it was true and rejoicing
exceedingly he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and
encounter in the midst of that broad plain for at all times and seasons
his fancy was full of the battles enchantments adventures crazy feats
loves and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry and
everything he said thought or did had reference to such things now the
cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming
along the same road in opposite directions which because of the dust
did not become visible until they drew near but don quixote asserted so
positively that they were armies that sancho was led to believe it and
say well and what are we to do senor
what said don quixote give aid and assistance to the weak and those
who need it and thou must know sancho that this which comes opposite
to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor alifanfaron lord of the
great isle of trapobana this other that marches behind me is that of his
enemy the king of the garamantas pentapolin of the bare arm for he
always goes into battle with his right arm bare
but why are these two lords such enemies
they are at enmity replied don quixote because this alifanfaron is a
furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of pentapolin who is a
very beautiful and moreover gracious lady and a christian and her
father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first
abandons the religion of his false prophet mahomet and adopts his own
by my beard said sancho but pentapolin does quite right and i will
in that thou wilt do what is thy duty sancho said don quixote for
to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed
that i can well understand answered sancho but where shall we put
this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over for i
believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of
that is true said don quixote and what you had best do with him is
to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not for the horses
we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even
rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another but attend to me
and observe for i wish to give thee some account of the chief knights
who accompany these two armies and that thou mayest the better see and
mark let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder whence both
they did so and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two
droves that don quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if
the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the
sight nevertheless seeing in his imagination what he did not see and
what did not exist he began thus in a loud voice
that knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour who bears upon his
shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel is the valiant
laurcalco lord of the silver bridge that one in armour with flowers of
gold who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field is
the dreaded micocolembo grand duke of quirocia that other of gigantic
frame on his right hand is the ever dauntless brandabarbaran de
boliche lord of the three arabias who for armour wears that serpent
skin and has for shield a gate which according to tradition is one of
those of the temple that samson brought to the ground when by his death
he revenged himself upon his enemies but turn thine eyes to the other
side and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the
ever victorious and never vanquished timonel of carcajona prince of new
biscay who comes in armour with arms quartered azure vert white and
yellow and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto
which says miau which is the beginning of the name of his lady who
according to report is the peerless miaulina daughter of the duke
alfeniquen of the algarve the other who burdens and presses the loins
of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank
and without any device is a novice knight a frenchman by birth pierres
papin by name lord of the baronies of utrique that other who with
iron shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti coloured zebra
and for arms bears azure vair is the mighty duke of nerbia
espartafilardo del bosque who bears for device on his shield an
asparagus plant with a motto in castilian that says rastrea mi suerte
and so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other
out of his imagination and to all he assigned off hand their arms
colours devices and mottoes carried away by the illusions of his
unheard of craze and without a pause he continued people of divers
nations compose this squadron in front here are those that drink of the
sweet waters of the famous xanthus those that scour the woody massilian
plains those that sift the pure fine gold of arabia felix those that
enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal thermodon those that in many
and various ways divert the streams of the golden pactolus the
numidians faithless in their promises the persians renowned in archery
the parthians and the medes that fight as they fly the arabs that ever
shift their dwellings the scythians as cruel as they are fair the
ethiopians with pierced lips and an infinity of other nations whose
features i recognise and descry though i cannot recall their names in
this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of
the olive bearing betis those that make smooth their countenances with
the water of the ever rich and golden tagus those that rejoice in the
fertilising flow of the divine genil those that roam the tartesian
plains abounding in pasture those that take their pleasure in the
elysian meadows of jerez the rich manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of
corn the wearers of iron old relics of the gothic race those that
bathe in the pisuerga renowned for its gentle current those that feed
their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding guadiana famed
for its hidden course those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad
pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty apennine in a word as many
good god what a number of countries and nations he named giving to each
its proper attributes with marvellous readiness brimful and saturated
with what he had read in his lying books sancho panza hung upon his
words without speaking and from time to time turned to try if he could
see the knights and giants his master was describing and as he could not
make out one of them he said to him
senor devil take it if theres a sign of any man you talk of knight or
giant in the whole thing maybe its all enchantment like the phantoms
how canst thou say that answered don quixote dost thou not hear the
neighing of the steeds the braying of the trumpets the roll of the
i hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep said sancho
which was true for by this time the two flocks had come close
the fear thou art in sancho said don quixote prevents thee from
seeing or hearing correctly for one of the effects of fear is to derange
the senses and make things appear different from what they are if thou
art in such fear withdraw to one side and leave me to myself for alone
i suffice to bring victory to that side to which i shall give my aid
and so saying he gave rocinante the spur and putting the lance in rest
shot down the slope like a thunderbolt sancho shouted after him crying
come back senor don quixote i vow to god they are sheep and ewes you
are charging come back unlucky the father that begot me what madness
is this look there is no giant nor knight nor cats nor arms nor
shields quartered or whole nor vair azure or bedevilled what are you
about sinner that i am before god but not for all these entreaties did
don quixote turn back on the contrary he went on shouting out ho
knights ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor
pentapolin of the bare arm follow me all ye shall see how easily i
shall give him his revenge over his enemy alifanfaron of the trapobana
so saying he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes and began
spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were
transfixing mortal enemies in earnest the shepherds and drovers
accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist seeing it was no use
they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as big
as ones fist don quixote gave no heed to the stones but letting drive
where art thou proud alifanfaron come before me i am a single knight
who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand and make thee yield thy
life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant pentapolin
garamanta here came a sugar plum from the brook that struck him on the
side and buried a couple of ribs in his body feeling himself so smitten
he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain and recollecting
his liquor he drew out his flask and putting it to his mouth began to
pour the contents into his stomach but ere he had succeeded in
swallowing what seemed to him enough there came another almond which
struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to
pieces knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its
course and sorely crushing two fingers of his hand such was the force
of the first blow and of the second that the poor knight in spite of
himself came down backwards off his horse the shepherds came up and
felt sure they had killed him so in all haste they collected their flock
together took up the dead beasts of which there were more than seven
and made off without waiting to ascertain anything further
all this time sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his
master was performing and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and the
occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him seeing him then
brought to the ground and that the shepherds had taken themselves off
he ran to him and found him in very bad case though not unconscious and
did i not tell you to come back senor don quixote and that what you
were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep
thats how that thief of a sage my enemy can alter and falsify
things answered don quixote thou must know sancho that it is a very
easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose
and this malignant being who persecutes me envious of the glory he knew
i was to win in this battle has turned the squadrons of the enemy into
droves of sheep at any rate do this much i beg of thee sancho to
undeceive thyself and see that what i say is true mount thy ass and
follow them quietly and thou shalt see that when they have gone some
little distance from this they will return to their original shape and
ceasing to be sheep become men in all respects as i described them to
thee at first but go not just yet for i want thy help and assistance
come hither and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing for i
feel as if there was not one left in my mouth
sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth now just
at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of don quixote so at
the very instant when sancho came to examine his mouth he discharged all
its contents with more force than a musket and full into the beard of
holy mary cried sancho what is this that has happened me clearly
this sinner is mortally wounded as he vomits blood from the mouth but
considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour
taste and smell that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask
which he had seen him drink and he was taken with such a loathing that
his stomach turned and he vomited up his inside over his very master
and both were left in a precious state sancho ran to his ass to get
something wherewith to clean himself and relieve his master out of his
alforjas but not finding them he well nigh took leave of his senses
and cursed himself anew and in his heart resolved to quit his master and
return home even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all
don quixote now rose and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his
teeth from falling out altogether with the other he laid hold of the
bridle of rocinante who had never stirred from his masters side so
loyal and well behaved was he and betook himself to where the squire
stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek like one in deep
dejection seeing him in this mood looking so sad don quixote said to
bear in mind sancho that one man is no more than another unless he
does more than another all these tempests that fall upon us are signs
that fair weather is coming shortly and that things will go well with
us for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever and hence it
follows that the evil having lasted long the good must be now nigh at
hand so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen
to me since thou hast no share in them
how have i not replied sancho was he whom they blanketed yesterday
perchance any other than my fathers son and the alforjas that are
missing to day with all my treasures did they belong to any other but
what are the alforjas missing sancho said don quixote
in that case we have nothing to eat to day replied don quixote
it would be so answered sancho if there were none of the herbs your
worship says you know in these meadows those with which knights errant
as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such like shortcomings
for all that answered don quixote i would rather have just now a
quarter of bread or a loaf and a couple of pilchards heads than all
the herbs described by dioscorides even with doctor lagunas notes
nevertheless sancho the good mount thy beast and come along with me
for god who provides for all things will not fail us more especially
when we are so active in his service as we are since he fails not the
midges of the air nor the grubs of the earth nor the tadpoles of the
water and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good and
on the evil and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just
your worship would make a better preacher than knight errant said
knights errant knew and ought to know everything sancho said don
quixote for there were knights errant in former times as well qualified
to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment as if
they had graduated in the university of paris whereby we may see that
the lance has never blunted the pen nor the pen the lance
well be it as your worship says replied sancho let us be off now
and find some place of shelter for the night and god grant it may be
somewhere where there are no blankets nor blanketeers nor phantoms nor
enchanted moors for if there are may the devil take the whole concern
ask that of god my son said don quixote and do thou lead on where
thou wilt for this time i leave our lodging to thy choice but reach me
here thy hand and feel with thy finger and find out how many of my
teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw for
sancho put in his fingers and feeling about asked him how many
grinders used your worship have on this side
four replied don quixote besides the back tooth all whole and quite
i say four if not five answered don quixote for never in my life
have i had tooth or grinder drawn nor has any fallen out or been
well then said sancho in this lower side your worship has no more
than two grinders and a half and in the upper neither a half nor any at
all for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand
luckless that i am said don quixote hearing the sad news his squire
gave him i had rather they despoiled me of an arm so it were not the
sword arm for i tell thee sancho a mouth without teeth is like a mill
without a millstone and a tooth is much more to be prized than a
diamond but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to
all this mount friend and lead the way and i will follow thee at
sancho did as he bade him and proceeded in the direction in which he
thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road which was
there very much frequented as they went along then at a slow pace for
the pain in don quixotes jaws kept him uneasy and ill disposed for
speed sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some
kind and among the things he said to him was that which will be told in
of the shrewd discourse which sancho held with his master and of the
adventure that befell him with a dead body together with other notable
it seems to me senor that all these mishaps that have befallen us of
late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed
by your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you
made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen and all the
rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that
helmet of malandrinos or whatever the moor is called for i do not very
thou art very right sancho said don quixote but to tell the truth
it had escaped my memory and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the
affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not
reminding me of it in time but i will make amends for there are ways of
compounding for everything in the order of chivalry
why have i taken an oath of some sort then said sancho
it makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath said don quixote
suffice it that i see thou art not quite clear of complicity and
whether or no it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a
in that case said sancho mind that your worship does not forget this
as you did the oath perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads to
amuse themselves once more with me or even with your worship if they see
while engaged in this and other talk night overtook them on the road
before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter and what made
it still worse was that they were dying of hunger for with the loss of
the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat and to
complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any
invention had really the appearance of one it so happened that the night
closed in somewhat darkly but for all that they pushed on sancho
feeling sure that as the road was the kings highway they might
reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two going along
then in this way the night dark the squire hungry the master
sharp set they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling
a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion
sancho was taken aback at the sight of them nor did don quixote
altogether relish them the one pulled up his ass by the halter the
other his hack by the bridle and they stood still watching anxiously to
see what all this would turn out to be and found that the lights were
approaching them and the nearer they came the greater they seemed at
which spectacle sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury and
don quixotes hair stood on end he however plucking up spirit a
this no doubt sancho will be a most mighty and perilous adventure in
which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and
unlucky me answered sancho if this adventure happens to be one of
phantoms as i am beginning to think it is where shall i find the ribs
be they phantoms ever so much said don quixote i will not permit
them to touch a thread of thy garments for if they played tricks with
thee the time before it was because i was unable to leap the walls of
the yard but now we are on a wide plain where i shall be able to wield
and if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time said
sancho what difference will it make being on the open plain or not
for all that replied don quixote i entreat thee sancho to keep a
good heart for experience will tell thee what mine is
i will please god answered sancho and the two retiring to one side
of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving
lights might be and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty
encamisados all on horseback with lighted torches in their hands the
awe inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of
sancho who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of
an ague and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they
perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over
with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to
the very feet of their mules for they could perceive plainly they were
not horses by the easy pace at which they went and as the encamisados
came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone this
strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite
enough to strike terror into sanchos heart and even into his masters
and save in don quixotes case did so for all sanchos resolution had
now broken down it was just the opposite with his master whose
imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the
he took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne
some sorely wounded or slain knight to avenge whom was a task reserved
for him alone and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in
rest fixed himself firmly in his saddle and with gallant spirit and
bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the
encamisados must of necessity pass and as soon as he saw them near at
halt knights or whosoever ye may be and render me account of who ye
are whence ye come where ye go what it is ye carry upon that bier
for to judge by appearances either ye have done some wrong or some
wrong has been done to you and it is fitting and necessary that i should
know either that i may chastise you for the evil ye have done or else
that i may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you
we are in haste answered one of the encamisados and the inn is far
off and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand and
don quixote was mightily provoked by this answer and seizing the mule by
the bridle he said halt and be more mannerly and render an account of
what i have asked of you else take my defiance to combat all of you
the mule was shy and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that
rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches an
attendant who was on foot seeing the encamisado fall began to abuse don
quixote who now moved to anger without any more ado laying his lance
in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded
to the ground and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with
which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see for it seemed just
as if wings had that instant grown upon rocinante so lightly and proudly
did he bear himself the encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed so
they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across
the plain with their lighted torches looking exactly like maskers
running on some gala or festival night the mourners too enveloped and
swathed in their skirts and gowns were unable to bestir themselves and
so with entire safety to himself don quixote belaboured them all and
drove them off against their will for they all thought it was no man but
a devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the
sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord
and said to himself clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant
a burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had
thrown by the light of which don quixote perceived him and coming up to
him he presented the point of the lance to his face calling on him to
yield himself prisoner or else he would kill him to which the prostrate
man replied i am prisoner enough as it is i cannot stir for one of my
legs is broken i entreat you if you be a christian gentleman not to
kill me which will be committing grave sacrilege for i am a licentiate
then what the devil brought you here being a churchman said don
what senor said the other my bad luck
then still worse awaits you said don quixote if you do not satisfy
me as to all i asked you at first
you shall be soon satisfied said the licentiate you must know then
that though just now i said i was a licentiate i am only a bachelor and
my name is alonzo lopez i am a native of alcobendas i come from the
city of baeza with eleven others priests the same who fled with the
torches and we are going to the city of segovia accompanying a dead body
which is in that litter and is that of a gentleman who died in baeza
where he was interred and now as i said we are taking his bones to
their burial place which is in segovia where he was born
god by means of a malignant fever that took him answered the
in that case said don quixote the lord has relieved me of the task
of avenging his death had any other slain him but he who slew him
having slain him there is nothing for it but to be silent and shrug
ones shoulders i should do the same were he to slay myself and i would
have your reverence know that i am a knight of la mancha don quixote by
name and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs
i do not know how that about righting wrongs can be said the bachelor
for from straight you have made me crooked leaving me with a broken leg
that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life and
the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in
such a way that i shall remain injured for ever and the height of
misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures
things do not all happen in the same way answered don quixote it all
came sir bachelor alonzo lopez of your going as you did by night
dressed in those surplices with lighted torches praying covered with
mourning so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the
other world and so i could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you and
i should have attacked you even had i known positively that you were the
very devils of hell for such i certainly believed and took you to be
as my fate has so willed it said the bachelor i entreat you sir
knight errant whose errand has been such an evil one for me to help me
to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the
i would have talked on till to morrow said don quixote how long were
you going to wait before telling me of your distress
he at once called to sancho who however had no mind to come as he was
just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule well laden with provender
which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them sancho made a bag of
his coat and getting together as much as he could and as the bag would
hold he loaded his beast and then hastened to obey his masters call
and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule then putting
