what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he as
he dressed to go to marya dmitrievnas if only prince andrew would
hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the house
on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him
pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in a
sleigh drawn by two gray trotting horses that were bespattering the
dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin dashed
past anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
dandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his white plumed hat
tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
yes indeed thats a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing
beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is
always cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldnt i give to be like
in marya dmitrievnas anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom
when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the
window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him
frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity
what has happened asked pierre entering marya dmitrievnas room
fine doings answered dmitrievna for fifty eight years have i lived
in this world and never known anything so disgraceful
and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him
marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew
without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole
kuragin into whose society pierres wife had thrown her and with whom
natasha had tried to elope during her fathers absence in order to be
pierre raised his shoulders and listened open mouthed to what was told
him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince andrews deeply
loved affianced wife the same natasha rostova who used to be so
charming should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was already
secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as
to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive
he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha whom
he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness
folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he
said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to
the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more
he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
disgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
such a look of cold dignity he did not know that natashas soul was
overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not
her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
but how get married said pierre in answer to marya dmitrievna he
things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna a
nice youth what a scoundrel and shes expecting him expecting him
since yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go on
after hearing the details of anatoles marriage from pierre and giving
vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya dmitrievna
told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or
bolkonski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair
which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel
and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brother in law in her name to
leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only
now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew
promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained her
wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room
mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either
she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and
stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre
pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning
natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski
troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles
one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having
come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken
off her engagement without consulting anybody its true this engagement
never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but
still with his fathers disapproval they wouldnt have been happy and
natasha wont lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to
take such a step without fathers or mothers consent and now shes
ill and god knows what its hard count hard to manage daughters in
pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
subject but the count returned to his troubles
sonya entered the room with an agitated face
natasha is not quite well shes in her room and would like to see you
marya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come
yes you are a great friend of bolkonskis no doubt she wants to send
him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all
and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
when marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha did
not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre
himself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
natasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and her
eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the
moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at
him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like the
others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did
he knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre and
addressing natasha let him tell you whether i have told the truth
natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
natalya ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of
pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is
true or not should make no difference to you because
then it is not true that hes married
has he been married long she asked on your honor
she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once
he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the thought of
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at
komonenos pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as
usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in
groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman
having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him
there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince
michael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yet
arrived one of pierres acquaintances while they were talking about
the weather asked if he had heard of kuragins abduction of rostova
which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and
said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he asked
everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and
another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this
calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and
as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home
anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dolokhov
consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to
him essential to see natasha in the evening he drove to his sisters to
discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home
after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince
anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of
pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return
at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered the
drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him
ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you dont know
she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her husbands head in his
glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that
rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife
anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french
anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to
follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself
if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene but
pierre did not reply and went out of the room
anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole
you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope with
mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french
i dont consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
pierres face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole
by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
to side till anatoles face showed a sufficient degree of terror
when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre
come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of
his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth
youre a scoundrel and a blackguard and i dont know what deprives me
from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre
expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french
he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put
i i didnt think of it i never promised because
have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward
anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table
that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa
i shant be violent dont be afraid said pierre in answer to a
frightened gesture of anatoles first the letters said he as if
repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short
pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get
thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never
breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova i
know i cant prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of
conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence
anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips
after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
a thing as other peoples happiness and peace and that you are ruining
a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women
like my wife with them you are within your rights for they know what
you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of
debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to
kidnap dont you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a
i dont know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as
pierre mastered his wrath i dont know that and dont want to he
said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw
but you have used such words to me mean and so on which as a man of
pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he
though it was tte  tte anatole continued still i cant
is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically
you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as
i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to
forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if
anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which
pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him
oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room
pierre drove to marya dmitrievnas to tell her of the fulfillment of her
wish that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in
a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as marya
dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had
been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily
procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
woke sonya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had
been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so
weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and so
the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and
sonya who had a tear stained face but he could not see natasha
pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
the attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumors
assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother in
law had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it
was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re establish natashas
he was awaiting prince andrews return with dread and went every day to
old prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from
mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which
natasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience
some days after anatoles departure pierre received a note from prince
andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him
as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father
natashas note to princess mary breaking off her engagement
mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it
to the old prince and he heard from him the story of natashas
prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next
morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state
as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to
hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
intrigue going on in petersburg the old princes voice and another now
and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she
sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was
evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre
saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
way her brother had taken the news of natashas faithlessness
he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let
him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better
than i expected evidently it had to be
but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre
princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand
how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince
andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh
horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his
father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously
gesticulating the conversation was about speranski the news of whose
sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow
now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a
month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to
understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
him all the blame of other mens mistakes is very easy but i maintain
that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately
posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to
well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but
the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in
to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of
after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish
frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and
about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his sons
tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
speranski which was still going on between the two old men
if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon
they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do
not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice
pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate
when prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took pierres arm and
asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made
up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince
andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a
packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he
stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed
pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and his
broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince
andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued
i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reports
of your brother in law having sought her hand or something of that
both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him
here are her letters and her portrait said he
he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre
give this to the countess if you see her
then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kuragin he
he left long ago she has been at deaths door
i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his
so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with his hand
said prince andrew and he snorted several times
he could not marry for he was married already said pierre
prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father
and where is your brother in law now if i may ask he said
he has gone to peters but i dont know said pierre
well it doesnt matter said prince andrew tell countess rostova
that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is
pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether
he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say
i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre
yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman
should be forgiven but i didnt say i could forgive her i cant
prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand
again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but
i am unable to follow in that gentlemans footsteps if you wish to be
my friend never speak to me of that of all that well good by so
pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary
the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as
always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her
satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them
pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
rostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else
at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming
evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father
now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation
the cause of which pierre so well understood
that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill the commission
entrusted to him natasha was in bed the count at the club and pierre
after giving the letters to sonya went to marya dmitrievna who was
interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes
natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she
but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been
no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sonya
when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind dont
tell her everything said she to pierre one hasnt the heart to scold
her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied
natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with
a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find
her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided
whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up
pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as usual
but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms
hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went
to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different
peter kirilovich she began rapidly prince bolkonski was your
friend is your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that
everything that had once been must now be different he told me once
pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had
reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so
sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach
he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and
breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears
yes i will tell him answered pierre but
natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be
im only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i
beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything
she trembled all over and sat down on a chair
a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed pierres heart
i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre
but i should like to know one thing
i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to
refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that
dont call him bad said natasha but i dont know dont know at
she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love
welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
we wont speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle
cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha
we wont speak of it my dear ill tell him everything but one thing
i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or
simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is
clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy
dont speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and
turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand
he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was
stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her
before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and self
all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest
cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment
ask on my knees for your hand and your love
for the first time for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and
tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room
pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining
tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the
sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh
where to now your excellency asked the coachman
where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the
club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison
with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her
home said pierre and despite twenty two degrees of frost fahrenheit
he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
it was clear and frosty above the dirty ill lit streets above the
black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky
did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised
at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry
sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the
prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white
light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant
comet of 1812 the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and
the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long
luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed
joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having
traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain
fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it
seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life
from the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of
the forces of western europe began and in 1812 these forces millions
of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from
the west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since 1811
russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june 1812
the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began
that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money
burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not
recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which
those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes
what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the
historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs
inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental
system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the
consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich
rumyantsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have
taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to
have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore
the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war
we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it
naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by englands
intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally
seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war
was napoleons ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the
war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the
war was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals
and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the
need of re establishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists of
that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
russia and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from
napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no 178 it is
natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of
view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to
posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient
to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and
tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander
was firm or because englands policy was astute or the duke of
oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the
duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed
and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them
to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried
away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with
unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present
themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart
from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the
event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to
serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleons refusal to
withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of
oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third
and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have
been so many less men in napoleons army and the war could not have
had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would
have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a
war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and
had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic
government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent
dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french
revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have
happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided to bring it
about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to
occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human
feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows
just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed
to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be
otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom
the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of
innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event
could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in
whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired or transported
provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak
individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not
understand the more we try to explain such events in history
reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal
aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action
performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance
there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which
is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive
life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him
man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in
the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done
is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man
stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with and
the more power he has over others the more evident is the
the kings heart is in the hands of the lord
history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses
every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes
though napoleon at that time in 1812 was more convinced than ever that
it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples 
as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never
been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while
thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive
life that is to say for history whatever had to be performed
 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples
the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by
the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co
ordinated to produce that movement and war reproaches for the
nonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburgs wrongs
the movement of troops into prussia undertaken as it seemed to
napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french
emperors love and habit of war coinciding with his peoples
inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the
expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received
in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of
contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace
but which only wounded the self love of both sides and millions of
other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its
attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried
by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or
because the boy standing below wants to eat it
nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in
which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who
finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally
right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he
wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and
he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic
events the so called great men are labels giving names to events and
like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself
every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is
in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
on the twenty ninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent
three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings
and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the
emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings
and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds
of his own that is which he had taken from other kings to the empress
of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the
empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband though he had
left another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she
seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly
believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end
and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander
calling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did
not want war and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join
his army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the
movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach
with six horses surrounded by pages aides de camp and an escort
along the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these
towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm
the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried
him in the same direction on the tenth of june  coming up with the
army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and
changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to
seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the wide
spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow
moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia
into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly and
contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an
advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen
early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and
looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
the river the troops knowing of the emperors presence were on the
lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive lempereur and
one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three
now well go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things
get hot by heaven there he is vive lempereur so these are
the steppes of asia its a nasty country all the same au revoir

saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive lempereur came
the voices of men old and young of most diverse characters and social
positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the
commencement of the long expected campaign and of rapture and devotion
to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill
on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was
brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in
the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the
guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for
him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped
near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river
vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and
napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log
that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed
him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him
and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid
out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of
his aides de camp galloped off to the polish uhlans
what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans
when one of the aides de camp rode up to them
the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the
polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech
from excitement asked the aide de camp whether he would be permitted to
swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident
fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he
begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperors eyes
the aide de camp replied that probably the emperor would not be
as soon as the aide de camp had said this the old mustached officer
with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat
and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped
into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown
restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest
part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after
him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others
tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses
manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and
though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they
were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when
the aide de camp having returned and choosing an opportune moment
ventured to draw the emperors attention to the devotion of the poles to
his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having
summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the
world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to
dumfound people and impel them to insane self oblivion he called for
some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to
their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which
they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with
difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had
got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat
and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he
no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy
that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper
money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter
containing information about the orders to the french army had been
found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had
needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion
dhonneur of which napoleon was himself the head
 those whom god wishes to destroy he drives mad
the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a
month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come
from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation
between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three
armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme
commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that
the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired
of waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded
the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time
in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the
courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish
aides de camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
the emperor by his aides de camp this idea was eagerly received the
emperor gave his consent the aides de camp collected money by
subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a
landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete
and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and
the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his
vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier
alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aides de
it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared
that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place
