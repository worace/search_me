a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front
line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one
anothers faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who
formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers
who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies
since early morning despite an injunction not to approach the picket
line the officers had been unable to keep sight seers away the
soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity
no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sight seers and
grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look
look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a
russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him
jabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to keep up with
wait a bit and listen its fine answered sidorov who was considered
the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrew
recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov had
come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his
now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and
trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot
dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the
campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was
trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the
way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had not
we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said
only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said the
well make you dance as we did under suvorov  said dolokhov
qu est ce quil chante  asked a frenchman
its ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a
former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the
bonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted him
not bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily
and dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers russian and shouldering
let us go ivan lukich he said to the captain
ah thats the way to talk french said the picket soldiers now
sidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless
sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he said
trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice
ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and
good humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french
involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to
unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as
but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon
having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince
andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped
beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an
artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the
officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing
behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
and artillerymens bonfires to the left not far from the farthest
cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the
greater part of the enemys opened out from this battery just facing
it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon grabern
could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops
amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were
evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from
that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it
was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was
posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position
our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the
dragoons in the center where tushins battery stood and from which
prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabern
on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the
bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was
wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on
both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it
difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out
his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the
position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to
bagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the
center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely
following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying
historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the
course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined
only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he
said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must
hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case
the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they
attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground
shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by
echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun
he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens
had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however
he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so
no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a
familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is
beyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats so friend
another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you cant
all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly
voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are very
wise because you can take everything along with you vodka and snacks
and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer
yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar
voice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it is whatever we may
say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only
the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer
well stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it said
why thought prince andrew thats the captain who stood up in the
sutlers hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable
some herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive a
he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and
nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it
had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near
the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground
and immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and
his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed
by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried
off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran
mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery
looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran
rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto
motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a
battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two
mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a
small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill
probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had
not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report
the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back
to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind him
growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply
from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came
lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern letter
and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once
moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian
wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to
crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him
it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood
rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself
passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid
movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and
on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the
face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say
before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw
in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him
the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for
him to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing
prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew
the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince
bagrations hard brown face with its half closed dull sleepy eyes
prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and
wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and
feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive
face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent
his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and
said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that
took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen
prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince
bagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spoke
particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to
hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of tushins
battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagration
rode an officer of the suite the princes personal adjutant zherkov
an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed
horse and a civilian an accountant who had asked permission to be
present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout full
faced man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and
presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and
adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy
he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to the
accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already
oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning
smile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkovs joke and
purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was
it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he
remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince but could not get it quite right
by this time they were all approaching tushins battery and a ball
whats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile
so thats what they hit with asked the accountant how awful
he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking
when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
ended with a thud into something soft f f flop and a cossack riding
a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with
his horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack
and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the
prince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the
cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say is
it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the care
of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber
which had caught in his cloak it was an old fashioned saber of a kind
no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvorov
giving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollection was
particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at
which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield
whose company asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standing by
he asked whose company but he really meant are you frightened
captain tushins your excellency shouted the red haired freckled
gunner in a merry voice standing to attention
yes yes muttered bagration as if considering something and he rode
as he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
former position a huge broad shouldered gunner number one holding a
mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a
trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the short round
shouldered captain tushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage
moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes
lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeble
voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note ill suited to his weak
bagration called to him and tushin raising three fingers to his cap
with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but
like a priests benediction approached the general though tushins
guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary
balls at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite in front of
no one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but after
consulting his sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had great
respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
village very good said bagration in reply to the officers report
and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before
him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on
which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet
flowed the soul stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard
and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the
suite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking us
to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagration
ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right
flank the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if
these battalions went away the guns would remain without support
prince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at
him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers remark was
just and that really no answer could be made to it but at that moment
an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the
regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were
coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was
retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagration bowed his head in
sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the right and sent
an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but this
adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of
the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a
heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and
so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood
as he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and as
it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in command
the one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at braunau that he
must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as
the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys
attack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been in
support of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listened
attentively to bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers and
the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were
really given but that prince bagration tried to make it appear that
everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinate
commanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accord
with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what
happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will
owing to the tact bagration showed his presence was very valuable
officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm
soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his
presence and were evidently anxious to display their courage before
prince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flank
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got to
the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a
bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he
was spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while
blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering
crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying
on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
unwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and
despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in
front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting after
the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode up
to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning
the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with
smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some
were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or
taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who
they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
often heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd
of soldiers it cant be an attack for they are not moving it cant
be a square for they are not drawn up for that
the commander of the regiment a thin feeble looking old man with a
pleasant smile his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes
giving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as a
host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had been
attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been
repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had
been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had
occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what
had happened during that half hour to the troops entrusted to him and
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement of
the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and our
men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry which
had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and
were firing at our men prince bagration bowed his head as a sign that
this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to his
adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth
chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the
changed expression on prince bagrations face at this moment it
expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a
man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water
the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of
profound thought the round steady hawks eyes looked before him
eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his
the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration entreating him
to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were please
your excellency for gods sake he kept saying glancing for support
at an officer of the suite who turned away from him there you see
and he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing
continually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach
that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we are
used to it but you sir will blister your hands he spoke as if those
bullets could not kill him and his half closed eyes gave still more
persuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the colonels
appeals but bagration did not reply he only gave an order to cease
firing and re form so as to give room for the two approaching
battalions while he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had
concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from right
to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite with
the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened
involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding
down over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggy
caps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standard
they march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations suite
the head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash
would take place on this side of it
the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came
two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had
reached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step
could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagration marched a
company commander a fine round faced man with a stupid and happy
expression the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that
moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
with the self satisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with
his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full
height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy
tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close
to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real
weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as
if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he
was happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at
each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces
the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in
step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating
to himself at each alternate step left left left a fat major
skirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had
fallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot
panting to catch up with his company a cannon ball cleaving the air
flew over the heads of bagration and his suite and fell into the column
to the measure of left left close up came the company
commanders voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle
round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the
flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men
ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked back
angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet
beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left
glad to do our best your exlen lency came a confused shout from the
ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
bagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we know
that ourselves another without looking round as though fearing to
relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on
the order was given to halt and down knapsacks
bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted
he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his felt coat
stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the french
column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill
forward with god said bagration in a resolute sonorous voice
turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a
cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
the french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagration
could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their
faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered legs
and turned out toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince bagration
gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the
ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smoke
appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded several
of our men fell among them the round faced officer who had marched so
gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was heard
hurrah ah ah rang a long drawn shout from our ranks and passing
bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous
and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe
the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
flank in the center tushins forgotten battery which had managed to
set fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the
french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus
gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side
of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the
different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted of
the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussars was
simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under
lannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the
general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately
zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and
galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage
failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was
having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the
firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they
could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order
the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was
serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been
assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was
serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much
exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the
right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in
discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the
regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the
impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a
battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the
he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars
flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do
what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze
but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling
together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of
lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming
up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of
the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted
drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlograd
commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret
once again colonel said the general i cant leave half my men in
the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the
i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly
replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry
i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you
quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching
his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come
to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i dont vish to
you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and
taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage the general
expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as
if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they
reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in
silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from
where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible
for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that
the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked
sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks
preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in
the other both passed the examination successfully as there was
nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be
alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they
would have remained there for a long time testing each others courage
had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a
muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked
the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the
hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of
retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it
was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for
the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount
before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that
terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear resembling the line
separating the living from the dead lay between them all were
conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would cross
it or not and how they would cross it agitated them all
the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put
to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having
his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor
of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang
out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards
still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars
alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this
if only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at last the
time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
foward with god lads rang out denisovs voice at a twot
the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the
before him on the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off
faster came the word of command and rostov felt rooks flanks
rostov anticipated his horses movements and became more and more
elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been
in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible and now he had
crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but
everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i
will slash at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saber
hur a a a ah came a roar of voices let anyone come my way now
thought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full
gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already
visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the
squadron rostov raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant
the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and
rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with
unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind him
bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at
how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov asked
and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a field
instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before
him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm
blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rook
tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his riders leg
blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostov
also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled
in the saddle where our men were and where the french he did not
having disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now the
line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and
could not answer can something bad have happened to me he wondered
as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was
hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not his
he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it ah
here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running
toward him they will help me in front came a man wearing a strange
shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose then
came two more and many more running behind one of them said something
strange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearing
similar shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms and
it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will take
me too who are these men thought rostov scarcely believing his eyes
can they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though
but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them
to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe
his eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at me
and why to kill me me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered his
mothers love for him and his familys and his friends and the
enemys intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they may
do it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or
realizing the situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked
nose was already so close that the expression of his face could be
seen and the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down
holding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostov he seized
his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran
with all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the
feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge
but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single
sentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed his
whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with
the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning his
good natured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went
through him no better not look he thought but having reached the
bushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind and
just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and
turning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostov
paused no theres some mistake thought he they cant have wanted
to kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a
seventy pound weight were tied to it he could run no more the
frenchman also stopped and took aim rostov closed his eyes and stooped
down one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered his
last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and
reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters
the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of
the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and
retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the
senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word
infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic
surrounded cut off were lost shouted the fugitives
the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general
realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the
thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had
never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for
negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the
recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above
all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self preservation he
clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to
the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately
missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any
cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an
exemplary officer of twenty two years service who had never been
having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the
copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and
descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the
fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him
continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so
terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance
distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of
his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the
air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate
of battles was evidently culminating in a panic
the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that
moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent
reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian
sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhins company
which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in
ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armed
only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and
such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had
thrown down their muskets and run dolokhov running beside timokhin
killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the
surrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned the
battalions re formed and the french who had nearly cut our left flank
in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able to
join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and major
ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies
pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the commanders
stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coat
of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and
over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an officers
sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently
into the commanders face and his lips were smiling though the
commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov he
could not help taking notice of the soldier
your excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointing to the
french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the
company dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt
sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember
all right all right replied the commander and turned to major
but dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his
head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair
a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency
tushins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the center
send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order
the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached
to tushins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by
someones order the battery had continued firing and was only not
captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the
french to suppose that here in the center the main russian forces were
concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each
occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns
soon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded in
look at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke fine grand
look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening
all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the
direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers
cried at each shot fine thats good look at it grand the fire
fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had
advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this
failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began
in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in
successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this
battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one
knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition wagon
drivers leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished
but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a
reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns
were turned against the ten gun battery tushins companion officer had
been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the
artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticed
the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them
little tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to
refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ran
forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french
smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels and
amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
jump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun now
aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing dead
or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble
voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and more
animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn
away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always the
case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers for the
most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillery
company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their
officer all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing
situation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on
owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
activity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
occurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated it
seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he
had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner
of the field he stood on was well known and familiar ground though he
thought of everything considered everything and did everything the
best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to
from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and
thud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces
of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men
and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side always
followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a
horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own
had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him
pleasure the enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from
which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker
there hes puffing again muttered tushin to himself as a small
cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the
now look out for the ball well throw it back
what do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close
come along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna  was the
name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large
and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed to
him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the
second guns crew was uncle tushin looked at him more often than at
anyone else and took delight in his every movement the sound of
musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing
seemed like someones breathing he listened intently to the ebb and
ah breathing again breathing he muttered to himself
he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing
cannon balls at the french with both hands
now then matvevna dear old lady dont let me down he was saying as
he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his
tushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned
him out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice
are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you
why are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at his
i dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap i
but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon
ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse
he paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball
stopped him he turned his horse and galloped off
retire all to retire he shouted from a distance
the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the same
it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the space
where tushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses
blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay
several dead men one ball after another passed over as he approached
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thought
of being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he and
dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did not
leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their
positions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin stepping
across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attended
a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an
artilleryman to prince andrew not like your honor
prince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seem
not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon
that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill
one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode
well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to tushin
good bye my dear fellow said tushin dear soul good bye my dear
fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes
the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke
hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark
and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the
cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his guns
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range
of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff
