book the third the track of a storm
chapter xv the footsteps die out for ever
we were all going direct the other way
in short the period was so far like the present period that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for
evil in the superlative degree of comparison only
there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face on the
throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face on the throne of france in both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes
that things in general were settled for ever
it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy five
spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period
as at this mrs southcott had recently attained her five and twentieth
blessed birthday of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of london and westminster even the cock lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years after rapping out its
messages as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally
deficient in originality rapped out theirs mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people
from a congress of british subjects in america which strange
to relate have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cock lane
france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill making paper money and spending it under the guidance of her
christian pastors she entertained herself besides with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off his tongue
torn out with pincers and his body burned alive because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of france and
norway there were growing trees when that sufferer was put to death
already marked by the woodman fate to come down and be sawn into
boards to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it terrible in history it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris there were
sheltered from the weather that very day rude carts bespattered with
rustic mire snuffed about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which
the farmer death had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the revolution but that woodman and that farmer though they work
unceasingly work silently and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous
in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting daring burglaries by armed men and
highway robberies took place in the capital itself every night
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers warehouses for security the highwayman
in the dark was a city tradesman in the light and being recognised and
challenged by his fellow tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
the captain gallantly shot him through the head and rode away the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers and the guard shot three dead and
then got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in peace
that magnificent potentate the lord mayor of london was made to stand
and deliver on turnham green by one highwayman who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue prisoners in london
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them loaded with rounds of shot and ball
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
court drawing rooms musketeers went into st giless to search
for contraband goods and the mob fired on the musketeers and the
musketeers fired on the mob and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way in the midst of them the hangman ever busy
and ever worse than useless was in constant requisition now stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals now hanging a housebreaker on
saturday who had been taken on tuesday now burning people in the
hand at newgate by the dozen and now burning pamphlets at the door of
westminster hall to day taking the life of an atrocious murderer
and to morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of
all these things and a thousand like them came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five
environed by them while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded
those two of the large jaws and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces trod with stir enough and carried their divine rights
with a high hand thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy five conduct their greatnesses and myriads of small
creatures the creatures of this chronicle among the rest along the
it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business
the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered up
shooters hill he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail
as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise under the circumstances but because the hill
and the harness and the mud and the mail were all so heavy that the
horses had three times already come to a stop besides once drawing the
coach across the road with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to blackheath reins and whip and coachman and guard however in
combination had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animals
are endued with reason and the team had capitulated and returned to
with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way through
the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints as often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand with a wary wo ho so ho then the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it like an
unusually emphatic horse denying that the coach could be got up the
hill whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a
nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind
there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding
none a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do it was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach lamps but these its own workings
and a few yards of road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it as if they had made it all
two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears and wore jack boots not one of the three could have said from
anything he saw what either of the other two was like and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind as from
the eyes of the body of his two companions in those days travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers as to the latter
when every posting house and ale house could produce somebody in
the captains pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non descript it was the likeliest thing upon the cards so the guard
of the dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventy five lumbering up shooters hill as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail beating his feet
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse pistols
the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers the passengers suspected one another and the guard they
all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the
wo ho said the coachman so then one more pull and youre at the
top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to get you to
my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop of shooters
the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided negative
made a decided scramble for it and the three other horses followed
suit once more the dover mail struggled on with the jack boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side they had stopped when the coach
stopped and they kept close company with it if any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way of
the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill the horses
stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent and open the coach door to let the passengers in
tst joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down from his
i say a horse at a canter coming up joe
i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving his hold
of the door and mounting nimbly to his place gentlemen in the kings
with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and stood on
the passenger booked by this history was on the coach step getting in
the two other passengers were close behind him and about to follow he
remained on the step half in the coach and half out of they remained
in the road below him they all looked from the coachman to the guard
and from the guard to the coachman and listened the coachman looked
back and the guard looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up
the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach added to the stillness of the night made it very quiet
indeed the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach as if it were in a state of agitation the hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard but at any rate the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath and holding
the breath and having the pulses quickened by expectation
the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill
so ho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar yo there stand
the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering
a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail
never you mind what it is the guard retorted what are you
our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name the guard
the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully
keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist
because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right in
your lifetime gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight
what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly quavering
i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard to
himself hes hoarser than suits me is jerry
a despatch sent after you from over yonder t and co
i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down into the
road assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach shut the door and
pulled up the window he may come close theres nothing wrong
i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that said the
well and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before
come on at a footpace dye mind me and if youve got holsters to that
saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em for im a devil
at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes the form of lead so
the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist
and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood the rider
stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed the passenger
a small folded paper the riders horse was blown and both horse and
rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence
the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman
there is nothing to apprehend i belong to tellsons bank you must
know tellsons bank in london i am going to paris on business a crown
he opened it in the light of the coach lamp on that side and
read first to himself and then aloud wait at dover for mamselle
its not long you see guard jerry say that my answer was recalled
jerry started in his saddle thats a blazing strange answer too
take that message back and they will know that i received this as
well as if i wrote make the best of your way good night
with those words the passenger opened the coach door and got in not at
all assisted by his fellow passengers who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep with no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action
the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm chest and having looked to the rest of its contents and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which there were a
few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinder box for he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach lamps had been blown
and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had only to shut
himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he were lucky in
thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the same of it
jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile not
only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his face and
shake the wet out of his hat brim which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon after standing with the bridle over his
heavily splashed arm until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again he turned to walk down the
after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust your
fore legs till i get you on the level said this hoarse messenger
glancing at his mare recalled to life thats a blazing strange
message much of that wouldnt do for you jerry i say jerry youd
be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life was to come into fashion
a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other a
solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there is in some of
its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it something of the
awfulness even of death itself is referable to this no more can i
turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved and vainly hope in time
to read it all no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable
water wherein as momentary lights glanced into it i have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged it was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring for ever and for ever when i had read
but a page it was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost when the light was playing on its surface and i stood
in ignorance on the shore my friend is dead my neighbour is dead
my love the darling of my soul is dead it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality and which i shall carry in mine to my lifes end in
any of the burial places of this city through which i pass is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their
innermost personality to me or than i am to them
as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king the
first minister of state or the richest merchant in london so with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach they were mysteries to one another as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six or his own coach and sixty with the
breadth of a county between him and the next
the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at
ale houses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes he had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface black with
no depth in the colour or form and much too near together as if they
were afraid of being found out in something singly if they kept too
far apart they had a sinister expression under an old cocked hat like
a three cornered spittoon and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat which descended nearly to the wearers knees when he stopped
for drink he moved this muffler with his left hand only while he
poured his liquor in with his right as soon as that was done he
no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as he rode
it wouldnt do for you jerry jerry you honest tradesman it wouldnt
suit your line of business recalled  bust me if i dont think hed
his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain several
times to take off his hat to scratch his head except on the crown
which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair standing jaggedly all
over it and growing down hill almost to his broad blunt nose it was
so like smiths work so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair that the best of players at leap frog might
have declined him as the most dangerous man in the world to go over
while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness
they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every shadow on the road
what time the mail coach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon
its tedious way with its three fellow inscrutables inside to whom
likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms
tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail as the bank
passenger with an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger
and driving him into his corner whenever the coach got a special
jolt nodded in his place with half shut eyes the little
coach windows and the coach lamp dimly gleaming through them and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger became the bank and did a great
stroke of business the rattle of the harness was the chink of money
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with
all its foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time then
the strong rooms underground at tellsons with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a
little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly burning candle and found them
safe and strong and sound and still just as he had last seen them
but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night he was on his way to dig some one
now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night did
not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of five and forty by
years and they differed principally in the passions they expressed
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state pride contempt
so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous colour emaciated hands
and figures but the face was in the main one face and every head was
prematurely white a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
the answer was always the same almost eighteen years
you had abandoned all hope of being dug out
you know that you are recalled to life
shall i show her to you will you come and see her
the answers to this question were various and contradictory sometimes
the broken reply was wait it would kill me if i saw her too soon
sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears and then it was
take me to her sometimes it was staring and bewildered and then it
was i dont know her i dont understand
after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig
and dig dig now with a spade now with a great key now with his
hands to dig this wretched creature out got out at last with earth
hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to dust the
passenger would then start to himself and lower the window to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek
yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the moving
patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within the real banking house by temple bar the
real business of the past day the real strong rooms the real express
sent after him and the real message returned would all be there out
of the midst of them the ghostly face would rise and he would accost
dig dig dig until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave
you had abandoned all hope of being dug out
the words were still in his hearing as just spoken distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that the
he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun there was a
ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppice wood
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees though the earth was cold and wet the sky was clear
and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful
eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun gracious
creator of day to be buried alive for eighteen years
when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the forenoon
the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coach door as his
custom was he did it with some flourish of ceremony for a mail journey
from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations the mildewy inside of the coach with its damp
and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its obscurity was rather
like a larger dog kennel mr lorry the passenger shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw a tangle of shaggy wrapper flapping hat and
muddy legs was rather like a larger sort of dog
there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer
yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair the
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon sir bed
i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber
and then breakfast sir yes sir that way sir if you please
show concord gentlemans valise and hot water to concord pull off
gentlemans boots in concord you will find a fine sea coal fire sir
fetch barber to concord stir about there now for concord
the concord bed chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it consequently another
drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord
and the coffee room when a gentleman of sixty formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well kept with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed along on his way to
the coffee room had no other occupant that forenoon than the gentleman
in brown his breakfast table was drawn before the fire and as he sat
with its light shining on him waiting for the meal he sat so still
that he might have been sitting for his portrait
very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist coat
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire he had a good leg and was a little vain
of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were of a
fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were trim he
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very close to his
head which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass
his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea a
face habitually suppressed and quieted was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner in years gone by some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of tellsons bank he had a healthy colour in his
cheeks and his face though lined bore few traces of anxiety
but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellsons bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people and perhaps
second hand cares like second hand clothes come easily off and on
completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait
mr lorry dropped off to sleep the arrival of his breakfast roused him
and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it
i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to day she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only ask for a
gentleman from tellsons bank please to let me know
yes sir we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris sir a
vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and companys house
yes we are quite a french house as well as an english one
yes sir not much in the habit of such travelling yourself i think
not of late years it is fifteen years since we since i came last
indeed sir that was before my time here sir before our peoples
time here sir the george was in other hands at that time sir
but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson and
company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen
you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far from
rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward from the
table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left
dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest while
he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtower according to the
when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll on
the beach the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself away
from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a marine
ostrich the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it liked was
destruction it thundered at the town and thundered at the cliffs and
brought the coast down madly the air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea a little
fishing was done in the port and a quantity of strolling about by
night and looking seaward particularly at those times when the tide
made and was near flood small tradesmen who did no business whatever
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter
as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen became
again charged with mist and vapour mr lorrys thoughts seemed to cloud
too when it was dark and he sat before the coffee room fire awaiting
his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast his mind was busily digging
a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work
mr lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
he set down his glass untouched this is mamselle said he
in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette
had arrived from london and would be happy to see the gentleman from
miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required none
then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellsons
immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience
the gentleman from tellsons had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettes apartment
it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables these had been oiled and
oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if they were buried in deep
graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of could be expected
the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorry picking his
way over the well worn turkey carpet supposed miss manette to be for
the moment in some adjacent room until having got past the two tall
candles he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire a young lady of not more than seventeen in a riding cloak
and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand as
his eyes rested on a short slight pretty figure a quantity of golden
hair a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look and
a forehead with a singular capacity remembering how young and smooth
it was of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright
fixed attention though it included all the four expressions as his
eyes rested on these things a sudden vivid likeness passed before him
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
channel one cold time when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high the likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier glass behind her on the frame of which a hospital
procession of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were
offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender and he made his formal bow to miss manette
pray take a seat sir in a very clear and pleasant young voice a
little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed
i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of an earlier
date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat
i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that
the word is not material miss either word will do
 respecting the small property of my poor father whom i never saw so
mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids as if they had any help for
 rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there to communicate
with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched to paris for
she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she he made her another bow
i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by
those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should go to
france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself
during the journey under that worthy gentlemans protection the
gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here
i was happy said mr lorry to be entrusted with the charge i shall
sir i thank you indeed i thank you very gratefully it was told me
by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature i have done my best to prepare myself and i naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are
after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance the young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression but it was pretty
and characteristic besides being singular and she raised her hand
as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed some passing
are you quite a stranger to me sir
am i not mr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards with
between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing he watched her as she mused and the
moment she raised her eyes again went on
in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than address you
miss manette i am a man of business i have a business charge to
acquit myself of in your reception of it dont heed me any more than
if i was a speaking machine truly i am not much else i will with
your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our customers
he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when he added
in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers he was a french gentleman a scientific
gentleman a man of great acquirements a doctor
why yes of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the
gentleman was of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the
gentleman was of repute in paris i had the honour of knowing him there
our relations were business relations but confidential i was at that
time in our french house and had been oh twenty years
at that time i may ask at what time sir
i speak miss of twenty years ago he married an english lady and
i was one of the trustees his affairs like the affairs of many other
french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tellsons hands
in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers these are mere business relations miss
there is no friendship in them no particular interest nothing like
sentiment i have passed from one to another in the course of my
business life just as i pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day in short i have no feelings i am a mere
but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to think the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him that when i was
left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father only two years
it was you who brought me to england i am almost sure it was you
mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips he then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding
the chair back with his left hand and using his right by turns to rub
his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his
miss manette it was i and you will see how truly i spoke of myself
just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the relations i hold
with my fellow creatures are mere business relations when you reflect
that i have never seen you since no you have been the ward of
tellsons house since and i have been busy with the other business of
tellsons house since feelings i have no time for them no chance
of them i pass my whole life miss in turning an immense pecuniary
after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most
unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your
regretted father now comes the difference if your father had not died
when he did dont be frightened how you start
she did indeed start and she caught his wrist with both her hands
pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitation a matter of
her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and began anew
as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though no art could
trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper across the water there for instance the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his wife had
implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any tidings of
him and all quite in vain then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor of beauvais
i entreat you to tell me more sir
i will i am going to you can bear it
i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
you speak collectedly and you are collected thats good though
his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter of business
regard it as a matter of business business that must be done now
if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage and spirit
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
a daughter a a matter of business dont be distressed miss if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead no dont kneel in
heavens name why should you kneel to me
for the truth o dear good compassionate sir for the truth
a a matter of business you confuse me and how can i transact
business if i am confused let us be clear headed if you could kindly
mention now for instance what nine times ninepence are or how many
shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging i should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind
without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been that she
thats right thats right courage business you have business before
