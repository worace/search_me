3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in its old
corner one ought to learn anew about cruelty and open ones eyes
one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest
gross errors as for instance have been fostered by ancient and
modern philosophers with regard to tragedy may no longer wander about
virtuously and boldly almost everything that we call higher culture
is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of cruelty this is
my thesis the wild beast has not been slain at all it lives it
flourishes it has only been transfigured that which constitutes the
painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in
so called tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime
up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics obtains its
sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty what the
roman enjoys in the arena the christian in the ecstasies of the cross
the spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bull fight
the present day japanese who presses his way to the tragedy the workman
of the parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions
the wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of
tristan and isolde what all these enjoy and strive with mysterious
ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great circe cruelty here
to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of
former times which could only teach with regard to cruelty that
it originated at the sight of the suffering of others there is an
abundant super abundant enjoyment even in ones own suffering in
causing ones own suffering and wherever man has allowed himself to be
persuaded to self denial in the religious sense or to self mutilation
as among the phoenicians and ascetics or in general to
repentance spasms to vivisection of conscience and to pascal like
sacrifizia dell intelleto he is secretly allured and impelled
forwards by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards
himself finally let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge
operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his
spirit to perceive against its own inclination and often enough against
the wishes of his heart he forces it to say nay where he would like
to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing
profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring
of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aims at
appearance and superficiality even in every desire for knowledge there
230 perhaps what i have said here about a fundamental will of the
spirit may not be understood without further details i may be allowed
a word of explanation that imperious something which is popularly
called the spirit wishes to be master internally and externally
and to feel itself master it has the will of a multiplicity for a
simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will
its requirements and capacities here are the same as those assigned by
physiologists to everything that lives grows and multiplies the power
of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong
tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold
to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just as it
arbitrarily re underlines makes prominent and falsifies for itself
certain traits and lines in the foreign elements in every portion of
the outside world its object thereby is the incorporation of new
experiences the assortment of new things in the old arrangements in
short growth or more properly the feeling of growth the feeling of
increased power is its object this same will has at its service an
apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference
of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of windows an inner
denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive
attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity
with the shutting in horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance
as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its
appropriating power its digestive power to speak figuratively and
in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else here
also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be
deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and so
but is only allowed to pass as such a delight in uncertainty and
ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary out of the way narrowness
and mystery of the too near of the foreground of the magnified
the diminished the misshapen the beautified an enjoyment of the
arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power finally in this
connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to
deceive other spirits and dissemble before them the constant pressing
and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit
enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises it enjoys
also its feeling of security therein it is precisely by its protean
arts that it is best protected and concealed counter to this
propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a
cloak in short for an outside for every outside is a cloak there
operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which takes and
insists on taking things profoundly variously and thoroughly as a
kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every
courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided as it ought
to be that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for
introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe
words he will say there is something cruel in the tendency of my
spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not
so in fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps
our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and
glorified we free very free spirits and some day perhaps such will
actually be our posthumous glory meanwhile for there is plenty of
time until then we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in
such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work has
just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance they are
beautiful glistening jingling festive words honesty love of truth
love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthful there
is something in them that makes ones heart swell with pride but we
anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the
secrecy of an anchorites conscience that this worthy parade of
verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and
gold dust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such
flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text homo natura
must again be recognized in effect to translate man back again into
nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and
subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over
the eternal original text homo natura to bring it about that man shall
henceforth stand before man as he now hardened by the discipline
of science stands before the other forms of nature with fearless
oedipus eyes and stopped ulysses ears deaf to the enticements of old
metaphysical bird catchers who have piped to him far too long thou
art more thou art higher thou hast a different origin this may be
a strange and foolish task but that it is a task who can deny why did
we choose it this foolish task or to put the question differently
why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this and thus
pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times have
not found and cannot find any better answer
231 learning alters us it does what all nourishment does that does not
merely conserve as the physiologist knows but at the bottom of our
souls quite down below there is certainly something unteachable
a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to
predetermined chosen questions in each cardinal problem there speaks
an unchangeable i am this a thinker cannot learn anew about man and
woman for instance but can only learn fully he can only follow to the
end what is fixed about them in himself occasionally we find certain
solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us perhaps they
are henceforth called convictions later on one sees in them only
footsteps to self knowledge guide posts to the problem which we
ourselves are or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody
our spiritual fate the unteachable in us quite down below in view
of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself permission
will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about
woman as she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally
232 woman wishes to be independent and therefore she begins to
enlighten men about woman as she is this is one of the worst
developments of the general uglifying of europe for what must these
clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self exposure bring
to light woman has so much cause for shame in woman there is so
unbridledness and indiscretion concealed study only womans behaviour
towards children which has really been best restrained and dominated
hitherto by the fear of man alas if ever the eternally tedious in
woman she has plenty of it is allowed to venture forth if she
begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art of
charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and
taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable
desires female voices are already raised which by saint aristophanes
make one afraid with medical explicitness it is stated in a
threatening manner what woman first and last requires from man is
it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be
scientific enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been mens affair
mens gift we remained therewith among ourselves and in the end
in view of all that women write about woman we may well have
considerable doubt as to whether woman really desires enlightenment
about herself and can desire it if woman does not thereby seek a new
ornament for herself i believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally
feminine why then she wishes to make herself feared perhaps she
thereby wishes to get the mastery but she does not want truth what
does woman care for truth from the very first nothing is more foreign
more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truth her great art is
falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty let us confess
it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in
woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the
company of beings under whose hands glances and delicate follies our
seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like follies to
us finally i ask the question did a woman herself ever acknowledge
profundity in a womans mind or justice in a womans heart and is it
not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by
woman herself and not at all by us we men desire that woman should
not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us just as it was
mans care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed
mulier taceat in ecclesia it was to the benefit of woman when napoleon
gave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand mulier taceat in
politicis and in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who calls
out to women today mulier taceat de mulierel
233 it betrays corruption of the instincts apart from the fact that
it betrays bad taste when a woman refers to madame roland or madame de
stael or monsieur george sand as though something were proved thereby
in favour of woman as she is among men these are the three comical
women as they are nothing more and just the best involuntary
234 stupidity in the kitchen woman as cook the terrible
thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of
the house is managed woman does not understand what food means and she
insists on being cook if woman had been a thinking creature she should
certainly as cook for thousands of years have discovered the most
important physiological facts and should likewise have got possession
of the healing art through bad female cooks through the entire lack
of reason in the kitchen the development of mankind has been longest
retarded and most interfered with even today matters are very little
235 there are turns and casts of fancy there are sentences little
handfuls of words in which a whole culture a whole society suddenly
crystallises itself among these is the incidental remark of madame de
lambert to her son mon ami ne vous permettez jamais que des folies
qui vous feront grand plaisir the motherliest and wisest remark by
the way that was ever addressed to a son
236 i have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what dante and
goethe believed about woman the former when he sang ella guardava
suso ed io in lei and the latter when he interpreted it the
eternally feminine draws us aloft for this is just what she believes
how the longest ennui flees when a man comes to our knees
age alas and science staid furnish even weak virtue aid
sombre garb and silence meet dress for every dame discreet
whom i thank when in my bliss god and my good tailoress
young a flower decked cavern home old a dragon thence doth roam
noble title leg thats fine man as well oh were he mine
speech in brief and sense in mass slippery for the jenny ass
237a woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds which losing
their way have come down among them from an elevation as something
delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animating but as something
also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away
238 to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to
deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally
hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal rights equal
training equal claims and obligations that is a typical sign of
shallow mindedness and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at
this dangerous spot shallow in instinct may generally be regarded as
suspicious nay more as betrayed as discovered he will probably prove
too short for all fundamental questions of life future as well as
present and will be unable to descend into any of the depths on the
other hand a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires and
has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and
harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman as
orientals do he must conceive of her as a possession as confinable
property as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her
mission therein he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense
rationality of asia upon the superiority of the instinct of asia as
the greeks did formerly those best heirs and scholars of asia who
as is well known with their increasing culture and amplitude of power
from homer to the time of pericles became gradually stricter towards
woman in short more oriental how necessary how logical even how
humanely desirable this was let us consider for ourselves
239 the weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so
much respect by men as at present this belongs to the tendency and
fundamental taste of democracy in the same way as disrespectfulness to
old age what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of
this respect they want more they learn to make claims the tribute
of respect is at last felt to be well nigh galling rivalry for rights
indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is
losing modesty and let us immediately add that she is also losing
taste she is unlearning to fear man but the woman who unlearns to
fear sacrifices her most womanly instincts that woman should venture
forward when the fear inspiring quality in man or more definitely
the man in man is no longer either desired or fully developed is
reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult
to understand is that precisely thereby woman deteriorates this is
what is happening nowadays let us not deceive ourselves about it
wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military
and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal
independence of a clerk woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portal
of the modern society which is in course of formation while she
thus appropriates new rights aspires to be master and inscribes
progress of woman on her flags and banners the very opposite realises
itself with terrible obviousness woman retrogrades since the french
revolution the influence of woman in europe has declined in proportion
as she has increased her rights and claims and the emancipation of
woman insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves and
not only by masculine shallow pates thus proves to be a remarkable
symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly
instincts there is stupidity in this movement an almost masculine
stupidity of which a well reared woman who is always a sensible
woman might be heartily ashamed to lose the intuition as to the ground
upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in
the use of her proper weapons to let herself go before man perhaps
even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in
refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity mans
faith in a veiled fundamentally different ideal in woman something
dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for
protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and
often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of
everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of
woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still
entails as though slavery were a counter argument and not rather a
condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culture what
does all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instincts
a defeminising certainly there are enough of idiotic friends and
corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex who
advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate
all the stupidities from which man in europe european manliness
suffers who would like to lower woman to general culture indeed
even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics here and there
they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers as
though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious
or ludicrous to a profound and godless man almost everywhere her
nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music
our latest german music and she is daily being made more hysterical
and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of
bearing robust children they wish to cultivate her in general still
more and intend as they say to make the weaker sex strong by
culture as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that
the cultivating of mankind and his weakening that is to say the
weakening dissipating and languishing of his force of will have
always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and
influential women in the world and lastly the mother of napoleon
had just to thank their force of will and not their schoolmasters for
their power and ascendancy over men that which inspires respect
in woman and often enough fear also is her nature which is more
natural than that of man her genuine carnivora like cunning
flexibility her tiger claws beneath the glove her naivete in egoism
extent and deviation of her desires and virtues that which in spite
of fear excites ones sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat
woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more
necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any
other creature fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has
hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in
tragedy which rends while it delights what and all that is now to
be at an end and the disenchantment of woman is in progress the
tediousness of woman is slowly evolving oh europe europe we know
the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee from which
danger is ever again threatening thee thy old fable might once more
become history an immense stupidity might once again overmaster
thee and carry thee away and no god concealed beneath it no only an
240 i heard once again for the first time richard wagners overture
to the mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy
latter day art which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music
as still living in order that it may be understood it is an honour
to germans that such a pride did not miscalculate what flavours
and forces what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it it
impresses us at one time as ancient at another time as foreign bitter
and too modern it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional it
is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarse it has fire
and courage and at the same time the loose dun coloured skin of fruits
which ripen too late it flows broad and full and suddenly there is a
moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that opens between cause
and effect an oppression that makes us dream almost a nightmare but
already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delight the most
manifold delight of old and new happiness including especially
the joy of the artist in himself which he refuses to conceal his
astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here
employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedients of art
which he apparently betrays to us all in all however no beauty no
south nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing
of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even
which is also emphasized as though the artist wished to say to us it
is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily
barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceits
and witticisms something german in the best and worst sense of
the word something in the german style manifold formless and
inexhaustible a certain german potency and super plenitude of
soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the raffinements of
decadence which perhaps feels itself most at ease there a real
genuine token of the german soul which is at the same time young and
aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity this kind of music
expresses best what i think of the germans they belong to the day
before yesterday and the day after tomorrow they have as yet no today
241 we good europeans we also have hours when we allow ourselves a
warm hearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow
views i have just given an example of it hours of national excitement
of patriotic anguish and all other sorts of old fashioned floods of
sentiment duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines
its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours in a
considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime
according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change
their material indeed i could think of sluggish hesitating races
which even in our rapidly moving europe would require half a century
ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and
soil attachment and return once more to reason that is to say to
good europeanism and while digressing on this possibility i
happen to become an ear witness of a conversation between two old
patriots they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently
spoke all the louder he has as much and knows as much philosophy as
a peasant or a corps student said the one he is still innocent but
what does that matter nowadays it is the age of the masses they lie on
their belly before everything that is massive and so also in politicis
a statesman who rears up for them a new tower of babel some monstrosity
of empire and power they call great what does it matter that we more
prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief
that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or
affair supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position
of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they
were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have
to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues out of love to a new and
doubtful mediocrity supposing a statesman were to condemn his people
generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something
better to do and think about and when in the depths of their souls
they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of
the restlessness emptiness and noisy wranglings of the essentially
politics practising nations supposing such a statesman were to
stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people were to
make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness
an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to
depreciate their most radical proclivities subvert their consciences
make their minds narrow and their tastes national what a statesman
who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for
throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman
would be great would he undoubtedly replied the other old patriot
vehemently otherwise he could not have done it it was mad perhaps to
wish such a thing but perhaps everything great has been just as mad
at its commencement misuse of words cried his interlocutor
contradictorily strong strong strong and mad not great the old
men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths in
each others faces but i in my happiness and apartness considered how
soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that
there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a
242 whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress
which now distinguishes the european whether we call it simply without
praise or blame by the political formula the democratic movement in
europe behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by
such formulas an immense physiological process goes on which is ever
extending the process of the assimilation of europeans their
increasing detachment from the conditions under which climatically and
hereditarily united races originate their increasing independence of
every definite milieu that for centuries would fain inscribe itself
with equal demands on soul and body that is to say the slow emergence
of an essentially super national and nomadic species of man who
possesses physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power
of adaptation as his typical distinction this process of the evolving
european which can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses but
will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth the
still raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it
and also the anarchism which is appearing at present this process
will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and
panegyrists the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon
the same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and
mediocrising of man will take place a useful industrious variously
serviceable and clever gregarious man are in the highest degree
suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and
attractive qualities for while the capacity for adaptation which is
every day trying changing conditions and begins a new work with every
generation almost with every decade makes the powerfulness of the type
impossible while the collective impression of such future europeans
will probably be that of numerous talkative weak willed and very
handy workmen who require a master a commander as they require their
daily bread while therefore the democratising of europe will tend to
the production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtle
sense of the term the strong man will necessarily in individual and
exceptional cases become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever
been before owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to
the immense variety of practice art and disguise i meant to say
that the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary
arrangement for the rearing of tyrants taking the word in all its
243 i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the
constellation hercules and i hope that the men on this earth will do
like the sun and we foremost we good europeans
244 there was a time when it was customary to call germans deep
by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new
germanism is covetous of quite other honours and perhaps misses
smartness in all that has depth it is almost opportune and patriotic
to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that
commendation in short whether german depth is not at bottom something
different and worse and something from which thank god we are on the
point of successfully ridding ourselves let us try then to relearn
with regard to german depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is
a little vivisection of the german soul the german soul is above all
manifold varied in its source aggregated and super imposed rather
than actually built this is owing to its origin a german who would
embolden himself to assert two souls alas dwell in my breast would
make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far
short of the truth about the number of souls as a people made up of
the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races perhaps even with a
preponderance of the pre aryan element as the people of the centre in
every sense of the term the germans are more intangible more ample
more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising
and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves they
escape definition and are thereby alone the despair of the french it
is characteristic of the germans that the question what is german
never dies out among them kotzebue certainly knew his germans well
enough we are known they cried jubilantly to him but sand also
thought he knew them jean paul knew what he was doing when he declared
himself incensed at fichtes lying but patriotic flatteries and
exaggerations but it is probable that goethe thought differently about
germans from jean paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with
regard to fichte it is a question what goethe really thought about the
germans but about many things around him he never spoke explicitly
and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence probably he
had good reason for it it is certain that it was not the wars of
independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it was
the french revolution the event on account of which he reconstructed
his faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearance
of napoleon there are words of goethe in which he condemns with
impatient severity as from a foreign land that which germans take a
pride in he once defined the famous german turn of mind as indulgence
towards its own and others weaknesses was he wrong it is
characteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them
the german soul has passages and galleries in it there are caves
hiding places and dungeons therein its disorder has much of the charm
of the mysterious the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to
chaos and as everything loves its symbol so the german loves the
clouds and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and
shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped
self displacing and growing is deep the german himself does not
exist he is becoming he is developing himself development is
therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain
of philosophical formulas a ruling idea which together with german
beer and german music is labouring to germanise all europe foreigners
are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature
at the basis of the german soul propounds to them riddles which
hegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end set to music
good natured and spiteful such a juxtaposition preposterous in the
case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified
in germany one has only to live for a while among swabians to know this
the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulness
agree alarmingly well with his physical rope dancing and nimble
boldness of which all the gods have learnt to be afraid if any one
wishes to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos let him
only look at german taste at german arts and manners what boorish
indifference to taste how the noblest and the commonest stand there
in juxtaposition how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution
of this soul the german drags at his soul he drags at everything he
experiences he digests his events badly he never gets done
with them and german depth is often only a difficult hesitating
digestion and just as all chronic invalids all dyspeptics like what
is convenient so the german loves frankness and honesty it is
so convenient to be frank and honest this confidingness this
complaisance this showing the cards of german honesty is probably the
most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to
nowadays it is his proper mephistophelean art with this he can still
achieve much the german lets himself go and thereby gazes with
faithful blue empty german eyes and other countries immediately
confound him with his dressing gown i meant to say that let german
depth be what it will among ourselves alone we perhaps take the
liberty to laugh at it we shall do well to continue henceforth to
honour its appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our
old reputation as a people of depth for prussian smartness and
berlin wit and sand it is wise for a people to pose and let itself
be regarded as profound clumsy good natured honest and foolish it
might even be profound to do so finally we should do honour to
our name we are not called the tiusche volk deceptive people for
245 the good old time is past it sang itself out in mozart how
happy are we that his rococo still speaks to us that his good
company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the chinese and
its flourishes his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the
amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the south can
still appeal to something left in us ah some time or other it will be
over with it but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with
the intelligence and taste for beethoven for he was only the last echo
of a break and transition in style and not like mozart the last echo
of a great european taste which had existed for centuries beethoven
is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly
breaking down and a future over young soul that is always coming
there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal
extravagant hope the same light in which europe was bathed when it
dreamed with rousseau when it danced round the tree of liberty of the
revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon
but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale how difficult
nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment how strangely does
the language of rousseau schiller shelley and byron sound to our ear
in whom collectively the same fate of europe was able to speak which
knew how to sing in beethoven whatever german music came afterwards
belongs to romanticism that is to say to a movement which
historically considered was still shorter more fleeting and more
superficial than that great interlude the transition of europe from
rousseau to napoleon and to the rise of democracy weber but what do
we care nowadays for freischutz and oberon or marschners hans
heiling and vampyre or even wagners tannhauser that is extinct
although not yet forgotten music this whole music of romanticism
besides was not noble enough was not musical enough to maintain its
position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses from the
beginning it was second rate music which was little thought of by
genuine musicians it was different with felix mendelssohn that halcyon
master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly
acquired admiration and was equally quickly forgotten as the beautiful
episode of german music but with regard to robert schumann who took
things seriously and has been taken seriously from the first he
was the last that founded a school do we not now regard it as a
satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very romanticism
of schumanns has been surmounted schumann fleeing into the saxon
switzerland of his soul with a half werther like half jean paul like
nature assuredly not like beethoven assuredly not like byron his
manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of
injustice schumann with his taste which was fundamentally a petty
taste that is to say a dangerous propensity doubly dangerous among
germans for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings going
constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who
revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning
a sort of girl and noli me tangere this schumann was already merely a
german event in music and no longer a european event as beethoven had
been as in a still greater degree mozart had been with schumann german
music was threatened with its greatest danger that of losing the voice
for the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair
246 what a torture are books written in german to a reader who has a
third ear how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp
of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance which germans call
a book and even the german who reads books how lazily how
reluctantly how badly he reads how many germans know and consider it
obligatory to know that there is art in every good sentence art which
must be divined if the sentence is to be understood if there is a
misunderstanding about its tempo for instance the sentence itself
is misunderstood that one must not be doubtful about the
rhythm determining syllables that one should feel the breaking of the
too rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm that one should lend a
fine and patient ear to every staccato and every rubato that one should
divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs and how
delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of
their arrangement who among book reading germans is complaisant enough
to recognize such duties and requirements and to listen to so much art
and intention in language after all one just has no ear for it
and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard and the most
delicate artistry is as it were squandered on the deaf these were my
thoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in
the art of prose writing have been confounded one whose words drop
down hesitatingly and coldly as from the roof of a damp cave he counts
on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language
like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toes feels the
dangerous bliss of the quivering over sharp blade which wishes to
247 how little the german style has to do with harmony and with the
ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves
write badly the german does not read aloud he does not read for the
ear but only with his eyes he has put his ears away in the drawer for
the time in antiquity when a man read which was seldom enough he read
something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when
any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it in a
loud voice that is to say with all the swellings inflections and
variations of key and changes of tempo in which the ancient public
world took delight the laws of the written style were then the same
as those of the spoken style and these laws depended partly on the
surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx
partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs in
the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch
as it is comprised in one breath such periods as occur in demosthenes
and cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath
were pleasures to the men of antiquity who knew by their own schooling
how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty
in the deliverance of such a period we have really no right to the
big period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense those
ancients indeed were all of them dilettanti in speaking consequently
connoisseurs consequently critics they thus brought their orators to
the highest pitch in the same manner as in the last century when all
italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song
and with it also the art of melody reached its elevation in germany
however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began
shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings there was
properly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical
discourse that delivered from the pulpit the preacher was the only one
in germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a
sentence strikes springs rushes flows and comes to a close he alone
had a conscience in his ears often enough a bad conscience for reasons
are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom
attained by a german or almost always too late the masterpiece of
german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its
greatest preacher the bible has hitherto been the best german
book compared with luthers bible almost everything else is merely
literature something which has not grown in germany and therefore
has not taken and does not take root in german hearts as the bible has
248 there are two kinds of geniuses one which above all engenders and
seeks to engender and another which willingly lets itself be fructified
and brings forth and similarly among the gifted nations there are
those on whom the womans problem of pregnancy has devolved and the
secret task of forming maturing and perfecting the greeks for
instance were a nation of this kind and so are the french and others
which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life like
the jews the romans and in all modesty be it asked like the
germans nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and
irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for
foreign races for such as let themselves be fructified and withal
imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force
and consequently empowered by the grace of god these two kinds of
geniuses seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand
249 every nation has its own tartuffery and calls that its
virtue one does not know cannot know the best that is in one
250 what europe owes to the jews many things good and bad and above
all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand
style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands of
infinite significations the whole romanticism and sublimity of moral
questionableness and consequently just the most attractive ensnaring
and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life
in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture its evening
sky now glows perhaps glows out for this we artists among the
spectators and philosophers are grateful to the jews
251 it must be taken into the bargain if various clouds and
disturbances in short slight attacks of stupidity pass over the
spirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer from national
nervous fever and political ambition for instance among present day
germans there is alternately the anti french folly the anti semitic
folly the anti polish folly the christian romantic folly the
wagnerian folly the teutonic folly the prussian folly just look at
those poor historians the sybels and treitschkes and their closely
bandaged heads and whatever else these little obscurations of the
german spirit and conscience may be called may it be forgiven me that
i too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not
remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began
to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me the first
symptom of political infection about the jews for instance listen
to the following i have never yet met a german who was favourably
inclined to the jews and however decided the repudiation of actual
anti semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this
prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the
sentiment itself but only against its dangerous excess and especially
against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of
sentiment on this point we must not deceive ourselves that germany
has amply sufficient jews that the german stomach the german blood
has difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this
quantity of jew as the italian the frenchman and the englishman
have done by means of a stronger digestion that is the unmistakable
declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen
and according to which one must act let no more jews come in and shut
the doors especially towards the east also towards austria thus
commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and
uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by
a stronger race the jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest
toughest and purest race at present living in europe they know how
to succeed even under the worst conditions in fact better than under
favourable ones by means of virtues of some sort which one would like
nowadays to label as vices owing above all to a resolute faith which
does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas they alter only
when they do alter in the same way that the russian empire makes
its conquest as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of
yesterday namely according to the principle as slowly as possible
a thinker who has the future of europe at heart will in all his
perspectives concerning the future calculate upon the jews as he
will calculate upon the russians as above all the surest and likeliest
factors in the great play and battle of forces that which is at present
called a nation in europe and is really rather a res facta than nata
indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta et picta is in
every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet
a race much less such a race aere perennus as the jews are such
nations should most carefully avoid all hot headed rivalry and
hostility it is certain that the jews if they desired or if they
were driven to it as the anti semites seem to wish could now have the
ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over europe that they are not
working and planning for that end is equally certain meanwhile they
rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and
absorbed by europe they long to be finally settled authorized and
respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the
wandering jew and one should certainly take account of this impulse
and tendency and make advances to it it possibly betokens a mitigation
of the jewish instincts for which purpose it would perhaps be useful
and fair to banish the anti semitic bawlers out of the country one
should make advances with all prudence and with selection pretty much
as the english nobility do it stands to reason that the more powerful
and strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relation
with the jews with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman
officer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many ways
to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some
intellect and intellectuality sadly lacking in the place referred to
could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of
commanding and obeying for both of which the country in question has
now a classic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festal
discourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached my
serious topic the european problem as i understand it the rearing
252 they are not a philosophical race the english bacon represents an
attack on the philosophical spirit generally hobbes hume and locke
an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more
than a century it was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself
it was locke of whom schelling rightly said je meprise locke in the
struggle against the english mechanical stultification of the world
hegel and schopenhauer along with goethe were of one accord the
two hostile brother geniuses in philosophy who pushed in different
directions towards the opposite poles of german thought and thereby
wronged each other as only brothers will do what is lacking in
england and has always been lacking that half actor and rhetorician
knew well enough the absurd muddle head carlyle who sought to conceal
under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself namely what was
lacking in carlyle real power of intellect real depth of intellectual
perception in short philosophy it is characteristic of such an
unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianity they need its
discipline for moralizing and humanizing the englishman more gloomy
sensual headstrong and brutal than the german is for that very
reason as the baser of the two also the most pious he has all the
more need of christianity to finer nostrils this english christianity
itself has still a characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholic
excess for which owing to good reasons it is used as an antidote the
finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is
in fact a step in advance with coarse mannered people a step towards
spiritualization the english coarseness and rustic demureness is still
most satisfactorily disguised by christian pantomime and by praying
and psalm singing or more correctly it is thereby explained and
differently expressed and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who
formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of methodism and
more recently as the salvation army a penitential fit may really be
the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can
be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted that however which
offends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music to speak
figuratively and also literally he has neither rhythm nor dance in
the movements of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for
rhythm and dance for music listen to him speaking look at the most
beautiful englishwoman walking in no country on earth are there more
beautiful doves and swans finally listen to them singing but i ask
253 there are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds
because they are best adapted for them there are truths which only
possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits one is pushed
to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of
respectable but mediocre englishmen i may mention darwin john
stuart mill and herbert spencer begins to gain the ascendancy in the
middle class region of european taste indeed who could doubt that it
is a useful thing for such minds to have the ascendancy for a time it
would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently
soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many
little common facts and deducing conclusions from them as exceptions
they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards
those who are the rules after all they have more to do than merely
to perceive in effect they have to be something new they have to
signify something new they have to represent new values the gulf
between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more
mysterious than one thinks the capable man in the grand style the
creator will possibly have to be an ignorant person while on the
other hand for scientific discoveries like those of darwin a certain
narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something
english may not be unfavourable for arriving at them finally let
it not be forgotten that the english with their profound mediocrity
brought about once before a general depression of european intelligence
what is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth century
or french ideas that consequently against which the german mind
rose up with profound disgust is of english origin there is no doubt
about it the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas their
best soldiers and likewise alas their first and profoundest victims
for owing to the diabolical anglomania of modern ideas the ame
francais has in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present
one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries its profound
passionate strength its inventive excellency almost with disbelief
one must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in
a determined manner and defend it against present prejudices and
appearances the european noblesse of sentiment taste and manners
taking the word in every high sense is the work and invention of
france the european ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideas is
254 even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectual
and refined culture of europe it is still the high school of taste but
one must know how to find this france of taste he who belongs to it
keeps himself well concealed they may be a small number in whom it
lives and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon
the strongest legs in part fatalists hypochondriacs invalids in
part persons over indulged over refined such as have the ambition to
they have all something in common they keep their ears closed in
presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic
bourgeois in fact a besotted and brutalized france at present sprawls
in the foreground it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste
and at the same time of self admiration at the funeral of victor hugo
there is also something else common to them a predilection to resist
intellectual germanizing and a still greater inability to do so
in this france of intellect which is also a france of pessimism
schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than
he has ever been in germany not to speak of heinrich heine who has
long ago been re incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists
of paris or of hegel who at present in the form of taine the first
of living historians exercises an almost tyrannical influence as
regards richard wagner however the more french music learns to
adapt itself to the actual needs of the ame moderne the more will it
wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehand it is already
taking place sufficiently there are however three things which the
french can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession
and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority
in europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and
vulgarizing of taste firstly the capacity for artistic emotion for
devotion to form for which the expression lart pour lart along
with numerous others has been invented such capacity has not been
lacking in france for three centuries and owing to its reverence for
the small number it has again and again made a sort of chamber
music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere
in europe the second thing whereby the french can lay claim to
a superiority over europe is their ancient many sided moralistic
culture owing to which one finds on an average even in the petty
romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de paris a
psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one
has no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in germany
the germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite
thereto which as we have said france has not grudged those who call
the germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect
as the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in voluptate
psychologica which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness
of german intercourse and as the most successful expression of
genuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate
thrills henri beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and
forerunning man who with a napoleonic tempo traversed his europe
in fact several centuries of the european soul as a surveyor and
discoverer thereof it has required two generations to overtake him
one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddles
that perplexed and enraptured him this strange epicurean and man of
interrogation the last great psychologist of france there is yet
a third claim to superiority in the french character there is a
successful half way synthesis of the north and south which makes them
comprehend many things and enjoins upon them other things which an
englishman can never comprehend their temperament turned alternately
to and from the south in which from time to time the provencal and
ligurian blood froths over preserves them from the dreadful northern
grey in grey from sunless conceptual spectrism and from poverty of
blood our german infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence
of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high
politics has with great resolution been prescribed according to
a dangerous healing art which bids me wait and wait but not yet
hope there is also still in france a pre understanding and
ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too
comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and
know how to love the south when in the north and the north when in the
south the born midlanders the good europeans for them bizet
has made music this latest genius who has seen a new beauty and
seduction who has discovered a piece of the south in music
255 i hold that many precautions should be taken against german music
suppose a person loves the south as i love it as a great school
of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills as a
boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign
existence believing in itself well such a person will learn to be
somewhat on his guard against german music because in injuring his
taste anew it will also injure his health anew such a southerner a
southerner not by origin but by belief if he should dream of the future
of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the
north and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper mightier and
perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a super german music which
does not fade pale and die away as all german music does at the
sight of the blue wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of sky a
super european music which holds its own even in presence of the brown
sunsets of the desert whose soul is akin to the palm tree and can be
at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beasts of prey i
could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew
nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some
sailors home sickness some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might
sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see
the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeing
towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to
256 owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality craze has
induced and still induces among the nations of europe owing also to the
short sighted and hasty handed politicians who with the help of this
craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the
disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude
policy owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable
at present the most unmistakable signs that europe wishes to be one
are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted with all
the more profound and large minded men of this century the real general
tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way
for that new synthesis and tentatively to anticipate the european of
the future only in their simulations or in their weaker moments in
old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlands they only rested
from themselves when they became patriots i think of such men as
napoleon goethe beethoven stendhal heinrich heine schopenhauer it
must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them about
whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings
geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves
still less of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now
resisted and opposed in france the fact remains nevertheless that
richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties are
most closely and intimately related to one another they are akin
fundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements
it is europe the one europe whose soul presses urgently and longingly
outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous art whither
into a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to express
accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not
express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress
tormented them that they sought in the same manner these last great
seekers all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears the
first artists of universal literary culture for the most part even
themselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts and
the senses wagner as musician is reckoned among painters as poet
among musicians as artist generally among actors all of them fanatics
for expression at any cost i specially mention delacroix the nearest
related to wagner all of them great discoverers in the realm of the
sublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverers
in effect in display in the art of the show shop all of them talented
far beyond their genius out and out virtuosi with mysterious accesses
to all that seduces allures constrains and upsets born enemies of
