treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason i gave
him a very short relation of my voyage of the conspiracy against me by
my own men of the country where they set me on shore and of my five
years residence there all which he looked upon as if it were a dream or
a vision whereat i took great offence for i had quite forgot the
faculty of lying so peculiar to yahoos in all countries where they
preside and consequently their disposition of suspecting truth in
others of their own species i asked him whether it were the custom in
his country to say the thing which was not i assured him i had
almost forgot what he meant by falsehood and if i had lived a thousand
years in houyhnhnmland i should never have heard a lie from the
meanest servant that i was altogether indifferent whether he believed me
or not but however in return for his favours i would give so much
allowance to the corruption of his nature as to answer any objection he
would please to make and then he might easily discover the truth
the captain a wise man after many endeavours to catch me tripping in
some part of my story at last began to have a better opinion of my
veracity but he added that since i professed so inviolable an
attachment to truth i must give him my word and honour to bear him
company in this voyage without attempting any thing against my life or
else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at lisbon i gave
him the promise he required but at the same time protested that i
would suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live among
our voyage passed without any considerable accident in gratitude to the
captain i sometimes sat with him at his earnest request and strove to
conceal my antipathy against human kind although it often broke out
which he suffered to pass without observation but the greatest part of
the day i confined myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crew
the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress
and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had this i would not
be prevailed on to accept abhorring to cover myself with any thing that
had been on the back of a yahoo i only desired he would lend me two
clean shirts which having been washed since he wore them i believed
would not so much defile me these i changed every second day and
we arrived at lisbon nov 5 1715 at our landing the captain forced
me to cover myself with his cloak to prevent the rabble from crowding
about me i was conveyed to his own house and at my earnest request he
led me up to the highest room backwards i conjured him to conceal from
all persons what i had told him of the houyhnhnms because the least
hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me but
probably put me in danger of being imprisoned or burnt by the
inquisition the captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly
made but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measure however don
pedro being almost of my size they fitted me well enough he accoutred
me with other necessaries all new which i aired for twenty four hours
the captain had no wife nor above three servants none of which were
suffered to attend at meals and his whole deportment was so obliging
added to very good human understanding that i really began to tolerate
his company he gained so far upon me that i ventured to look out of
the back window by degrees i was brought into another room whence i
peeped into the street but drew my head back in a fright in a weeks
time he seduced me down to the door i found my terror gradually
lessened but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase i was at last
bold enough to walk the street in his company but kept my nose well
in ten days don pedro to whom i had given some account of my domestic
affairs put it upon me as a matter of honour and conscience that i
ought to return to my native country and live at home with my wife and
children he told me there was an english ship in the port just ready
to sail and he would furnish me with all things necessary it would be
tedious to repeat his arguments and my contradictions he said it was
altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as i desired to live
in but i might command in my own house and pass my time in a manner as
i complied at last finding i could not do better i left lisbon the
24th day of november in an english merchantman but who was the master i
never inquired don pedro accompanied me to the ship and lent me twenty
pounds he took kind leave of me and embraced me at parting which i
bore as well as i could during this last voyage i had no commerce with
the master or any of his men but pretending i was sick kept close in
my cabin on the fifth of december 1715 we cast anchor in the downs
about nine in the morning and at three in the afternoon i got safe to my
my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy because they
concluded me certainly dead but i must freely confess the sight of them
filled me only with hatred disgust and contempt and the more by
reflecting on the near alliance i had to them for although since my
unfortunate exile from the houyhnhnm country i had compelled myself to
tolerate the sight of yahoos and to converse with don pedro de mendez
yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues
and ideas of those exalted houyhnhnms and when i began to consider
that by copulating with one of the yahoo species i had become a parent
of more it struck me with the utmost shame confusion and horror
as soon as i entered the house my wife took me in her arms and kissed
me at which having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for
so many years i fell into a swoon for almost an hour at the time i am
writing it is five years since my last return to england during the
first year i could not endure my wife or children in my presence the
very smell of them was intolerable much less could i suffer them to eat
in the same room to this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread
or drink out of the same cup neither was i ever able to let one of them
take me by the hand the first money i laid out was to buy two young
stone horses which i keep in a good stable and next to them the groom
is my greatest favourite for i feel my spirits revived by the smell he
contracts in the stable my horses understand me tolerably well i
converse with them at least four hours every day they are strangers to
bridle or saddle they live in great amity with me and friendship to each
the authors veracity his design in publishing this work his censure
of those travellers who swerve from the truth the author clears himself
from any sinister ends in writing an objection answered the method of
planting colonies his native country commended the right of the crown
to those countries described by the author is justified the difficulty
of conquering them the author takes his last leave of the reader
proposes his manner of living for the future gives good advice and
thus gentle reader i have given thee a faithful history of my travels
for sixteen years and above seven months wherein i have not been so
studious of ornament as of truth i could perhaps like others have
astonished thee with strange improbable tales but i rather chose to
relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style because my
principal design was to inform and not to amuse thee
it is easy for us who travel into remote countries which are seldom
visited by englishmen or other europeans to form descriptions of
wonderful animals both at sea and land whereas a travellers chief aim
should be to make men wiser and better and to improve their minds by the
bad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning foreign
i could heartily wish a law was enacted that every traveller before he
were permitted to publish his voyages should be obliged to make oath
before the lord high chancellor that all he intended to print was
absolutely true to the best of his knowledge for then the world would no
longer be deceived as it usually is while some writers to make their
works pass the better upon the public impose the grossest falsities on
the unwary reader i have perused several books of travels with great
delight in my younger days but having since gone over most parts of the
globe and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own
observation it has given me a great disgust against this part of
reading and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so
impudently abused therefore since my acquaintance were pleased to
think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country i
imposed on myself as a maxim never to be swerved from that i would
strictly adhere to truth neither indeed can i be ever under the least
temptation to vary from it while i retain in my mind the lectures and
example of my noble master and the other illustrious houyhnhnms of whom
i had so long the honour to be an humble hearer
i know very well how little reputation is to be got by writings which
require neither genius nor learning nor indeed any other talent except
a good memory or an exact journal i know likewise that writers of
travels like dictionary makers are sunk into oblivion by the weight and
bulk of those who come last and therefore lie uppermost and it is
highly probable that such travellers who shall hereafter visit the
countries described in this work of mine may by detecting my errors if
there be any and adding many new discoveries of their own justle me
out of vogue and stand in my place making the world forget that ever i
was an author this indeed would be too great a mortification if i
wrote for fame but as my sole intention was the public good i cannot be
altogether disappointed for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his own
vices when he considers himself as the reasoning governing animal of
his country i shall say nothing of those remote nations where yahoos
preside among which the least corrupted are the brobdingnagians whose
wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to
observe but i forbear descanting further and rather leave the
judicious reader to his own remarks and application
i am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with
no censurers for what objections can be made against a writer who
relates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries where
we have not the least interest with respect either to trade or
negotiations i have carefully avoided every fault with which common
writers of travels are often too justly charged besides i meddle not
the least with any party but write without passion prejudice or
ill will against any man or number of men whatsoever i write for the
noblest end to inform and instruct mankind over whom i may without
breach of modesty pretend to some superiority from the advantages i
received by conversing so long among the most accomplished houyhnhnms
i write without any view to profit or praise i never suffer a word to
pass that may look like reflection or possibly give the least offence
even to those who are most ready to take it so that i hope i may with
justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless against whom the
remarkers will never be able to find matter for exercising their
i confess it was whispered to me that i was bound in duty as a
subject of england to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state
at my first coming over because whatever lands are discovered by a
subject belong to the crown but i doubt whether our conquests in the
countries i treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez over
the naked americans the lilliputians i think are hardly worth the
charge of a fleet and army to reduce them and i question whether it
might be prudent or safe to attempt the brobdingnagians or whether an
english army would be much at their ease with the flying island over
their heads the houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well prepared
for war a science to which they are perfect strangers and especially
against missive weapons however supposing myself to be a minister of
state i could never give my advice for invading them their prudence
unanimity unacquaintedness with fear and their love of their country
would amply supply all defects in the military art imagine twenty
thousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army confounding
the ranks overturning the carriages battering the warriors faces into
mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs for they would well
deserve the character given to augustus recalcitrat undique tutus
but instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation i
rather wish they were in a capacity or disposition to send a sufficient
number of their inhabitants for civilizing europe by teaching us the
first principles of honour justice truth temperance public spirit
fortitude chastity friendship benevolence and fidelity the names of
all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages and are
to be met with in modern as well as ancient authors which i am able to
but i had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge his
majestys dominions by my discoveries to say the truth i had conceived
a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon
those occasions for instance a crew of pirates are driven by a storm
they know not whither at length a boy discovers land from the topmast
they go on shore to rob and plunder they see a harmless people are
entertained with kindness they give the country a new name they take
formal possession of it for their king they set up a rotten plank or a
stone for a memorial they murder two or three dozen of the natives
bring away a couple more by force for a sample return home and get
their pardon here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by
divine right ships are sent with the first opportunity the natives
driven out or destroyed their princes tortured to discover their gold a
free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust the earth reeking
with the blood of its inhabitants and this execrable crew of butchers
employed in so pious an expedition is a modern colony sent to convert
but this description i confess does by no means affect the british
nation who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom care
and justice in planting colonies their liberal endowments for the
advancement of religion and learning their choice of devout and able
pastors to propagate christianity their caution in stocking their
provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the
mother kingdom their strict regard to the distribution of justice in
supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with
officers of the greatest abilities utter strangers to corruption and
to crown all by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors who
have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they
preside and the honour of the king their master
but as those countries which i have described do not appear to have any
desire of being conquered and enslaved murdered or driven out by
colonies nor abound either in gold silver sugar or tobacco i did
humbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our zeal our
valour or our interest however if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion i am ready to depose when i shall be
lawfully called that no european did ever visit those countries before
me i mean if the inhabitants ought to be believed unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two yahoos said to have been seen many years
but as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereigns name it
never came once into my thoughts and if it had yet as my affairs then
stood i should perhaps in point of prudence and self preservation have
having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller i here take a final leave of all my courteous readers
and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriff
to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which i learned among the
houyhnhnms to instruct the yahoos of my own family is far as i
shall find them docible animals to behold my figure often in a glass
and thus if possible habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of
a human creature to lament the brutality to houyhnhnms in my own
country but always treat their persons with respect for the sake of my
noble master his family his friends and the whole houyhnhnm race
whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments
i began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me at the
farthest end of a long table and to answer but with the utmost brevity
the few questions i asked her yet the smell of a yahoo continuing
very offensive i always keep my nose well stopped with rue lavender or
tobacco leaves and although it be hard for a man late in life to
remove old habits i am not altogether out of hopes in some time to
suffer a neighbour yahoo in my company without the apprehensions i am
yet under of his teeth or his claws
my reconcilement to the yahoo kind in general might not be so
difficult if they would be content with those vices and follies only
which nature has entitled them to i am not in the least provoked at the
sight of a lawyer a pickpocket a colonel a fool a lord a gamester a
politician a whoremonger a physician an evidence a suborner an
attorney a traitor or the like this is all according to the due course
of things but when i behold a lump of deformity and diseases both in
body and mind smitten with pride it immediately breaks all the measures
of my patience neither shall i be ever able to comprehend how such an
animal and such a vice could tally together the wise and virtuous
houyhnhnms who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational
creature have no name for this vice in their language which has no
terms to express any thing that is evil except those whereby they
describe the detestable qualities of their yahoos among which they
were not able to distinguish this of pride for want of thoroughly
understanding human nature as it shows itself in other countries where
that animal presides but i who had more experience could plainly
observe some rudiments of it among the wild yahoos
but the houyhnhnms who live under the government of reason are no
more proud of the good qualities they possess than i should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm which no man in his wits would boast of
although he must be miserable without them i dwell the longer upon this
subject from the desire i have to make the society of an english yahoo
by any means not insupportable and therefore i here entreat those who
have any tincture of this absurd vice that they will not presume to come
