rostovs since the day of his departure for the army to be in anna
pavlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in the
service and he at once understood his role letting his hostess make
use of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully scanned
each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
each of those present and the advantages that might accrue he took the
seat indicated to him beside the fair helene and listened to the general
vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that
not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them and
she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the actual phrase
used by the vienna cabinet said the danish charge daffaires
the doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellect with a
we must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor of
austria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never have thought
of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it
ah my dear vicomte put in anna pavlovna lurope for some reason
she called it urope as if that were a specially refined french
pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a
frenchman lurope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere 
after that anna pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the king
of prussia in order to draw boris into the conversation
boris listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turn
but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor the
beautiful helene whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
speaking of the position of prussia anna pavlovna very naturally asked
boris to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state he
found the prussian army boris speaking with deliberation told them in
pure correct french many interesting details about the armies and the
court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about
the facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the general
attention and anna pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was
received with pleasure by all her visitors the greatest attention of
all to boris narrative was shown by helene she asked him several
questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state
of the prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned to him with
you absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that implied
that for certain considerations he could not know of this was
on tuesday between eight and nine it will give me great pleasure
boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation
with her when anna pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her
you know her husband of course said anna pavlovna closing her eyes
and indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture ah she is such an
unfortunate and charming woman dont mention him before her please
when boris and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte had
bending forward in his armchair he said le roi de prusse and having
le roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing and
then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna pavlovna waited
for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she
began to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the
it is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but
hippolyte interrupted her with the words le roi de prusse and
again as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said no
anna pavlovna frowned mortemart hippolytes friend addressed him
come now what about your roi de prusse
oh its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a joke
he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to
get in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le roi de
boris smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical or
appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybody
your joke is too bad its witty but unjust said anna pavlovna
we are not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right principles
the conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
political news it became particularly animated toward the end of the
evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned
you know n n received a snuffbox with the portrait last year said
the man of profound intellect why shouldnt s s get the same
pardon me a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward but not a
will you bet the ribbon of the order is a different matter
when everybody rose to go helene who had spoken very little all the
evening again turned to boris asking him in a tone of caressing
significant command to come to her on tuesday
it is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile toward
anna pavlovna and anna pavlovna with the same sad smile with which she
spoke of her exalted patroness supported helenes wish
it seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening about the
prussian army helene had suddenly found it necessary to see him she
seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
but on tuesday evening having come to helenes splendid salon boris
received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to
come there were other guests and the countess talked little to him and
only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a
whisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinner tomorrow in
during that stay in petersburg boris became an intimate in the
the war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere one
heard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen and
recruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the seat of war
came contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously
interpreted the life of old prince bolkonski prince andrew and
in 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia
despite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeable
since the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not think
it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperor
himself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and
strength he was continually traveling through the three provinces
entrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severe
to cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home went to
his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as his
grandfather called him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet
nurse and nurse savishna in the late princess rooms and princess mary
spent most of the day in the nursery taking a mothers place to her
little nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemed
passionately fond of the boy and princess mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel as she
near the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards the angels upper lip was slightly raised as though about
to smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and
princess mary admitted to one another that the angels face reminded
them strangely of the little princess but what was still stranger
though of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in the
expression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face prince
andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
wife ah why have you done this to me
soon after prince andrews return the old prince made over to him a
large estate bogucharovo about twenty five miles from bald hills
partly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hills
partly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
his fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude
prince andrew made use of bogucharovo began building and spent most of
after the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not to
continue his military service and when the war recommenced and
everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in the
recruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and his son
seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old man
roused by activity expected the best results from the new campaign
while prince andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war and
secretly regretting this saw only the dark side
on february 26 1807 the old prince set off on one of his circuits
prince andrew remained at bald hills as usual during his fathers
absence little nicholas had been unwell for four days the coachman who
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
letters to princess marys apartments but did not find him there he
was told that the prince had gone to the nursery
if you please your excellency petrusha has brought some papers said
one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was sitting on a childs
little chair while frowning and with trembling hands he poured drops
from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water
what is it he said crossly and his hand shaking unintentionally he
poured too many drops into the glass he threw the mixture onto the
floor and asked for some more water the maid brought it
there were in the room a childs cot two boxes two armchairs a table
a childs table and the little chair on which prince andrew was
sitting the curtains were drawn and a single candle was burning on the
table screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on
my dear said princess mary addressing her brother from beside the
cot where she was standing better wait a bit later
oh leave off you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off
and this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an exasperated
my dear really its better not to wake him hes asleep said
prince andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed wineglass
perhaps wed really better not wake him he said hesitating
as you please really i think so but as you please said
princess mary evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had
prevailed she drew her brothers attention to the maid who was calling
it was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the boy
who was in a high fever these last days mistrusting their household
doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town they had
been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by sleeplessness
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
petrusha has come with papers from your father whispered the maid
devil take them he muttered and after listening to the verbal
instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
still the same wait for heavens sake karl ivanich always says that
sleep is more important than anything whispered princess mary with a
prince andrew went up to the child and felt him he was burning hot
confound you and your karl ivanich he took the glass with the drops
but he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes
and stooped glass in hand over the infant
but i wish it he said i beg you give it him
princess mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and
calling the nurse began giving the medicine the child screamed
hoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and sat
down on a sofa in the next room
he still had all the letters in his hand opening them mechanically he
began reading the old prince now and then using abbreviations wrote
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows
have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news if
its not false bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over
buonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing and the
rewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is a german i
congratulate him i cant make out what the commander at korchevo a
certain khandrikov is up to till now the additional men and provisions
have not arrived gallop off to him at once and say ill have his head
off if everything is not here in a week have received another letter
about the preussisch eylau battle from petenka he took part in it and
its all true when mischief makers dont meddle even a german beats
buonaparte he is said to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallop
off to korchevo without delay and carry out instructions
prince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope it was a
closely written letter of two sheets from bilibin he folded it up
without reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with the
words gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructions
no pardon me i wont go now till the child is better thought he
going to the door and looking into the nursery
princess mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the baby
ah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought prince
andrew recalling his fathers letter yes we have gained a victory
over bonaparte just when im not serving yes yes hes always poking
fun at me ah well let him and he began reading bilibins letter
which was written in french he read without understanding half of it
read only to forget if but for a moment what he had too long been
thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else
bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and
though he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms he
described the whole campaign with a fearless self censure and self
derision genuinely russian bilibin wrote that the obligation of
diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in prince
andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army the
letter was old having been written before the battle at preussisch
since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote bilibin
as you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i have
certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me what
i have seen during these last three months is incredible
i begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks the
prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed
us three times in three years we take up their cause but it turns out
that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches and
in his rude and savage way throws himself on the prussians without
giving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twists
of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the
i most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to bonaparte
that your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a
manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed i
have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded the
prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and lay
the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks the
king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all
in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it
turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war
on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have
everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a
commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz success
might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovski and
kamenski the latter was preferred the general comes to us suvorov
like in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy and
on the 4th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mails are
taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everything
himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
for us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to
him we search but none are to be found the field marshal grows
impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor to
count t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wild
furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens
them and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah so
thats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep
an eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes the
famous order of the day to general bennigsen
i am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army
you have brought your army corps to pultusk routed here it is exposed
and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as you
yourself reported to count buxhowden yesterday you must think of
from all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a saddle
sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents my
riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on the command
to the general next in seniority count buxhowden having sent him my
whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack
of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only one
days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all as
reported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmoretzki and all
that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain in
hospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humbly
submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its
present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already
in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious
task for which he was chosen i shall await your most gracious
permission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of a
secretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the army
does not produce the slightest stir a blind man has left it there are
the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all
this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining after the field marshals departure it
appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle
buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen does
not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who are
within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to
fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does so this is
the battle of pultusk which is considered a great victory but in my
opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a very
bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who retreat
after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is
we who lost the battle of pultusk in short we retreat after the battle
but send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and general
bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the post of commander in
chief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of the
army to general buxhowden during this interregnum we begin a very
original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer as
it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid general
buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief so
energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at
the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general buxhowden was all but
attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhowden pursues us we
scuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to
the other at last our enemy buxhowden catches us and attacks both
generals are angry and the result is a challenge on buxhowdens part
and an epileptic fit on bennigsens but at the critical moment the
courier who carried the news of our victory at pultusk to petersburg
returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief and our first
foe buxhowden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the
second bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a third
enemy rises before us namely the orthodox russian soldiers loudly
demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot the stores are
empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way of
which our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiments form
bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword
the inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick
and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack our
headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to
disperse them during one of these attacks they carried off my empty
portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give all
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much fear
this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other
at first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in
spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
bilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he
had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it was
not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyes
rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had
read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he
thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized with
alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it
just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cot
my dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was
seized by an unreasoning panic it occurred to him that the child was
dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror
all is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead
he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and
that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the curtain aside
and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby
at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the
bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in
prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had
already lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught him
tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the soft
forehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand even
the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not dead
but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrew
longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless
little creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at his
head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket he
heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the
cot he did not look round but still gazing at the infants face
listened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary
who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and
dropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her without
looking and held out his hand to her she pressed it
the child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead
prince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her
luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
were in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly
catching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gesture
and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair
yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh
soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the
kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with
him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and
explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that steps
would be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then they
were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies
were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs
punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals
asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some of
the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with
alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
with their management and embezzlement of money some after their first
fright were amused by pierres lisp and the new words they had not heard
before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the
cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from this
speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends
the chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierres intentions but
remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the
general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory
despite count bezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year
pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an
allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the
about 80000 went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about
30000 went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town house
and the allowance to the three princesses about 15000 was given in
pensions and the same amount for asylums 150000 alimony was sent to
the countess about 70000 went for interest on debts the building of a
new church previously begun had cost about 10000 in each of the last
two years and he did not know how the rest about 100000 rubles was
spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides this the
chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests or
of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the first
task pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but he
felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that these
consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
them or make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the state
of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of
paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to
which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded that
steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by
showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bank
and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation
the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling
the forests in the province of kostroma the land lower down the river
and the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which
operations according to him were connected with such complicated
measures the removal of injunctions petitions permits and so on
that pierre became quite bewildered and only replied
pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward for
his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
in kiev pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to make
his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largest
landowner of the province temptations to pierres greatest weakness
the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the lodge were so
strong that he could not resist them again whole days weeks and
months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied
with evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no time
for reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he had hoped
to lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundings
of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not
fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of moral
life and that of the seven virtues he lacked two morality and the love
of death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another
of the precepts that of reforming the human race and had other
virtues love of his neighbor and especially generosity
in the spring of 1807 he decided to return to petersburg on the way he
intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god had
entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit
the chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almost
insane unprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfs made
some concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as
impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildings schools
hospitals and asylums on all the estates before the master arrived
everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he
knew pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religious
ones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality as
according to his understanding of his master would touch and delude
the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna
carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on
pierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions
which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
depth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with bread
and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permission
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them
to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of
peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women with
infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work
on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him
surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he was
instructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierre
saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection
all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon
to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to
which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the
touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full skirted blue
what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and
paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters day and
that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the
chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that
since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they
did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and
that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children
and secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that the
brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial
labor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know that
where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments
had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been
increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his
estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brother instructor
how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good
thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it
he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at
receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a
toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was
pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would
happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly
on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power to
carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the
count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank
but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gave that is to
say all that could be got out of them
returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state of
mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
friend bolkonski whom he had not seen for two years
bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields
and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the house lay
behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks
still bare of grass it was at the end of a village that stretched along
the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir
the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a
bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facade
still in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laid
out the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water
cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight the
bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress of
tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond anton a man who had looked after prince
andrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that the
prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom
pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
he quickly entered the small reception room with its still unplastered
wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but anton
ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door
well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice
ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back
pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face
with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierre
embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
well i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew
pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise he
was struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was a
smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and
glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more manly
looking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to it
were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything they put
questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be
talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans
for the future pierres journeys and occupations the war and so on
the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in his
friends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with
which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful
animation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew would
have liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not the
latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in prince
andrews presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views
which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour
he checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistible
desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
different and better pierre than he had been in petersburg
i cant tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardly
yes we have altered much very much since then said prince andrew
plans repeated prince andrew ironically my plans he said as if
astonished at the word well you see im building i mean to settle
pierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrews face which
no i meant to ask pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him
but why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travels and
all you have been doing on your estates
pierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
made prince andrew several times prompted pierres story of what he had
been doing as though it were all an old time story and he listened not
only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was telling
pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company and
ill tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who evidently
also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor i am only
bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going back to my
sister today i will introduce you to her but of course you know her
already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he
now found nothing in common we will go after dinner and would you now
they went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the political
news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here
while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future
however this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and then
i was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrew
pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said
hurriedly i will tell you some time how it all happened but you know
but you know how it all ended dont you you heard of the duel
and so you had to go through that too
one thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said
why so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a very good
no to kill a man is bad wrong
why is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man to know
what is right and what is wrong men always did and always will err and
in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong
what does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasure
that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was roused had
begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to his present
and who has told you what is bad for another man he asked
bad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad for ourselves
yes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is
something i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growing more
and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to
pierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils in life
remorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evils to
live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now
and love of ones neighbor and self sacrifice began pierre no i
cant agree with you to live only so as not to do evil and not to have
to repent is not enough i lived like that i lived for myself and
ruined my life and only now when i am living or at least trying
pierres modesty made him correct himself to live for others only
now have i understood all the happiness of life no i shall not agree
with you and you do not really believe what you are saying prince
andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smile
when you see my sister princess mary youll get on with her he
said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short
pause but everyone lives in his own way you lived for yourself and
say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began
living for others i experienced just the reverse i lived for glory
and after all what is glory the same love of others a desire to do
something for them a desire for their approval so i lived for others
and not almost but quite ruined my life and i have become calmer
since i began to live only for myself
but what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierre
growing excited what about your son your sister and your father
but thats just the same as myself they are not others explained
prince andrew the others ones neighbors le prochain as you and
princess mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil le
prochain your kiev peasants to whom you want to do good
and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he
you are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited what
error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing a
little though i did very little and did it very badly what evil can
there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves
were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth beyond
ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a
comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and
consolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dying
of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
rendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum
for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a
peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i give
them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i have
done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done something
toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and
more than that you cant make me believe that you do not think so
yourself and the main thing is he continued that i know and know
for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure
yes if you put it like that its quite a different matter said
prince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you build
hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whats
right and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not by
us well you want an argument he added come on then
they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
come lets argue then said prince andrew you talk of schools he
went on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you want
to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his
cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while
it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and
that is just what you want to deprive him of i envy him but you want
to make him what i am without giving him my means then you say
lighten his toil but as i see it physical labor is as essential to
him as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to you
or me you cant help thinking i go to bed after two in the morning
thoughts come and i cant sleep but toss about till dawn because i
think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing
if he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill just as i could
not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so
he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die the
third thing what else was it you talked about and prince andrew
crooked a third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a fit he
is dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up he will drag
about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years it
would be far easier and simpler for him to die others are being born
and there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if you
grudged losing a laborer thats how i regard him but you want to cure
him from love of him and he does not want that and besides what a
notion that medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said he
prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke
readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time his
glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless
oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand how
one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago in
moscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i dont
live at all everything seems hateful to me myself most of all then
i dont eat dont wash and how is it with you
why not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the
contrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible im
alive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i can
but with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sit
life as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do nothing
but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to
choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of it
they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications
for it the kind of good natured fussy shallowness necessary for the
position then theres this house which must be built in order to have
a nook of ones own in which to be quiet and now theres this
after austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank you very
much i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russian
army and i wont not even if bonaparte were here at smolensk
threatening bald hills even then i wouldnt serve in the russian army
well as i was saying he continued recovering his composure now
theres this recruiting my father is chief in command of the third
district and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under
