go in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent as for
sancho he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant
and not finding it he said i see now that its all enchantment in this
house for the last time on this very spot where i am now i got ever so
many thumps without knowing who gave them to me or being able to see
anybody and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about though i saw
it cut off with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if
what blood and fountains are you talking about enemy of god and his
saints said the landlord dont you see you thief that the blood and
the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red
wine swimming all over the room and i wish i saw the soul of him that
i know nothing about that said sancho all i know is it will be my
bad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away like
salt in water for sancho awake was worse than his master asleep so
much had his masters promises addled his wits
the landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the
mischievous doings of the master and swore it should not be like the
last time when they went without paying and that their privileges of
chivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off
without paying even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put
to the damaged wine skins the curate was holding don quixotes hands
who fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of
the princess micomicona knelt before the curate and said exalted and
beauteous lady your highness may live from this day forth fearless of
any harm this base being could do you and i too from this day forth am
released from the promise i gave you since by the help of god on high
and by the favour of her by whom i live and breathe i have fulfilled it
did not i say so said sancho on hearing this you see i wasnt drunk
there you see my master has already salted the giant theres no doubt
about the bulls my county is all right
who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair master and
man and laugh they did all except the landlord who cursed himself but
at length the barber cardenio and the curate contrived with no small
trouble to get don quixote on the bed and he fell asleep with every
appearance of excessive weariness they left him to sleep and came out
to the gate of the inn to console sancho panza on not having found the
head of the giant but much more work had they to appease the landlord
who was furious at the sudden death of his wine skins and said the
landlady half scolding half crying at an evil moment and in an unlucky
hour he came into my house this knight errant would that i had never
set eyes on him for dear he has cost me the last time he went off with
the overnight score against him for supper bed straw and barley for
himself and his squire and a hack and an ass saying he was a knight
adventurer god send unlucky adventures to him and all the adventurers in
the world and therefore not bound to pay anything for it was so settled
by the knight errantry tariff and then all because of him came the
other gentleman and carried off my tail and gives it back more than two
cuartillos the worse all stripped of its hair so that it is no use for
my husbands purpose and then for a finishing touch to all to burst my
wine skins and spill my wine i wish i saw his own blood spilt but let
him not deceive himself for by the bones of my father and the shade of
my mother they shall pay me down every quarts or my name is not what it
is and i am not my fathers daughter all this and more to the same
effect the landlady delivered with great irritation and her good maid
maritornes backed her up while the daughter held her peace and smiled
from time to time the curate smoothed matters by promising to make good
all losses to the best of his power not only as regarded the wine skins
but also the wine and above all the depreciation of the tail which they
set such store by dorothea comforted sancho telling him that she
pledged herself as soon as it should appear certain that his master had
decapitated the giant and she found herself peacefully established in
her kingdom to bestow upon him the best county there was in it with
this sancho consoled himself and assured the princess she might rely
upon it that he had seen the head of the giant and more by token it had
a beard that reached to the girdle and that if it was not to be seen now
it was because everything that happened in that house went by
enchantment as he himself had proved the last time he had lodged there
dorothea said she fully believed it and that he need not be uneasy for
all would go well and turn out as he wished all therefore being
appeased the curate was anxious to go on with the novel as he saw there
was but little more left to read dorothea and the others begged him to
finish it and he as he was willing to please them and enjoyed reading
it himself continued the tale in these words
the result was that from the confidence anselmo felt in camillas
virtue he lived happy and free from anxiety and camilla purposely
looked coldly on lothario that anselmo might suppose her feelings
towards him to be the opposite of what they were and the better to
support the position lothario begged to be excused from coming to the
house as the displeasure with which camilla regarded his presence was
plain to be seen but the befooled anselmo said he would on no account
allow such a thing and so in a thousand ways he became the author of his
own dishonour while he believed he was insuring his happiness meanwhile
the satisfaction with which leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her
amour reached such a height that regardless of everything else she
followed her inclinations unrestrainedly feeling confident that her
mistress would screen her and even show her how to manage it safely at
last one night anselmo heard footsteps in leonelas room and on trying
to enter to see who it was he found that the door was held against him
which made him all the more determined to open it and exerting his
strength he forced it open and entered the room in time to see a man
leaping through the window into the street he ran quickly to seize him
or discover who he was but he was unable to effect either purpose for
leonela flung her arms round him crying be calm senor do not give way
to passion or follow him who has escaped from this he belongs to me and
anselmo would not believe it but blind with rage drew a dagger and
threatened to stab leonela bidding her tell the truth or he would kill
her she in her fear not knowing what she was saying exclaimed do
not kill me senor for i can tell you things more important than any you
tell me then at once or thou diest said anselmo
it would be impossible for me now said leonela i am so agitated
leave me till to morrow and then you shall hear from me what will fill
you with astonishment but rest assured that he who leaped through the
window is a young man of this city who has given me his promise to
anselmo was appeased with this and was content to wait the time she
asked of him for he never expected to hear anything against camilla so
satisfied and sure of her virtue was he and so he quitted the room and
left leonela locked in telling her she should not come out until she had
told him all she had to make known to him he went at once to see
camilla and tell her as he did all that had passed between him and her
handmaid and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of
there is no need of saying whether camilla was agitated or not for so
great was her fear and dismay that making sure as she had good reason
to do that leonela would tell anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness
she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed
and that same night as soon as she thought that anselmo was asleep she
packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money and without
being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to
lotharios to whom she related what had occurred imploring him to
convey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be
safe from anselmo the state of perplexity to which camilla reduced
lothario was such that he was unable to utter a word in reply still less
to decide upon what he should do at length he resolved to conduct her to
a convent of which a sister of his was prioress camilla agreed to this
and with the speed which the circumstances demanded lothario took her to
the convent and left her there and then himself quitted the city without
as soon as daylight came anselmo without missing camilla from his side
rose cager to learn what leonela had to tell him and hastened to the
room where he had locked her in he opened the door entered but found
no leonela all he found was some sheets knotted to the window a plain
proof that she had let herself down from it and escaped he returned
uneasy to tell camilla but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the
house he was lost in amazement he asked the servants of the house about
her but none of them could give him any explanation as he was going in
search of camilla it happened by chance that he observed her boxes were
lying open and that the greater part of her jewels were gone and now he
became fully aware of his disgrace and that leonela was not the cause of
his misfortune and just as he was without delaying to dress himself
completely he repaired sad at heart and dejected to his friend
lothario to make known his sorrow to him but when he failed to find him
and the servants reported that he had been absent from his house all
night and had taken with him all the money he had he felt as though he
were losing his senses and to make all complete on returning to his own
house he found it deserted and empty not one of all his servants male
or female remaining in it he knew not what to think or say or do and
his reason seemed to be deserting him little by little he reviewed his
position and saw himself in a moment left without wife friend or
servants abandoned he felt by the heaven above him and more than all
robbed of his honour for in camillas disappearance he saw his own ruin
after long reflection he resolved at last to go to his friends village
where he had been staying when he afforded opportunities for the
contrivance of this complication of misfortune he locked the doors of
his house mounted his horse and with a broken spirit set out on his
journey but he had hardly gone half way when harassed by his
reflections he had to dismount and tie his horse to a tree at the foot
of which he threw himself giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs and
there he remained till nearly nightfall when he observed a man
approaching on horseback from the city of whom after saluting him he
the citizen replied the strangest that have been heard for many a day
for it is reported abroad that lothario the great friend of the wealthy
anselmo who lived at san giovanni carried off last night camilla the
wife of anselmo who also has disappeared all this has been told by a
maid servant of camillas whom the governor found last night lowering
herself by a sheet from the windows of anselmos house i know not
indeed precisely how the affair came to pass all i know is that the
whole city is wondering at the occurrence for no one could have expected
a thing of the kind seeing the great and intimate friendship that
existed between them so great they say that they were called the two
is it known at all said anselmo what road lothario and camilla
not in the least said the citizen though the governor has been very
god be with you said the citizen and went his way
this disastrous intelligence almost robbed anselmo not only of his senses
but of his life he got up as well as he was able and reached the house
of his friend who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune but seeing him
come pale worn and haggard perceived that he was suffering some heavy
affliction anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest and
to be given writing materials his wish was complied with and he was left
lying down and alone for he desired this and even that the door should
be locked finding himself alone he so took to heart the thought of his
misfortune that by the signs of death he felt within him he knew well his
life was drawing to a close and therefore he resolved to leave behind
him a declaration of the cause of his strange end he began to write but
before he had put down all he meant to say his breath failed him and he
yielded up his life a victim to the suffering which his ill advised
curiosity had entailed upon him the master of the house observing that
it was now late and that anselmo did not call determined to go in and
ascertain if his indisposition was increasing and found him lying on his
face his body partly in the bed partly on the writing table on which
he lay with the written paper open and the pen still in his hand having
first called to him without receiving any answer his host approached
him and taking him by the hand found that it was cold and saw that he
was dead greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to
witness the sad fate which had befallen anselmo and then he read the
paper the handwriting of which he recognised as his and which contained
a foolish and ill advised desire has robbed me of life if the news of
my death should reach the ears of camilla let her know that i forgive
her for she was not bound to perform miracles nor ought i to have
required her to perform them and since i have been the author of my own
so far anselmo had written and thus it was plain that at this point
before he could finish what he had to say his life came to an end the
next day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives who
had already ascertained his misfortune as well as the convent where
camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on that
inevitable journey not on account of the tidings of his death but
because of those she received of her lovers departure although she saw
herself a widow it is said she refused either to quit the convent or
take the veil until not long afterwards intelligence reached her that
lothario had been killed in a battle in which m de lautrec had been
recently engaged with the great captain gonzalo fernandez de cordova in
the kingdom of naples whither her too late repentant lover had repaired
on learning this camilla took the veil and shortly afterwards died worn
out by grief and melancholy this was the end of all three an end that
i like this novel said the curate but i cannot persuade myself of
its truth and if it has been invented the authors invention is faulty
for it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a
costly experiment as anselmos if it had been represented as occurring
between a gallant and his mistress it might pass but between husband and
wife there is something of an impossibility about it as to the way in
which the story is told however i have no fault to find
which treats of more curious incidents that occurred at the inn
just at that instant the landlord who was standing at the gate of the
inn exclaimed here comes a fine troop of guests if they stop here we
four men said the landlord riding a la jineta with lances and
bucklers and all with black veils and with them there is a woman in
white on a side saddle whose face is also veiled and two attendants on
so near answered the landlord that here they come
hearing this dorothea covered her face and cardenio retreated into don
quixotes room and they hardly had time to do so before the whole party
the host had described entered the inn and the four that were on
horseback who were of highbred appearance and bearing dismounted and
came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side saddle and one
of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at the
entrance of the room where cardenio had hidden himself all this time
neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word only on
sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms
fall like one that was ill and weak the attendants on foot then led the
horses away to the stable observing this the curate curious to know who
these people in such a dress and preserving such silence were went to
where the servants were standing and put the question to one of them who
faith sir i cannot tell you who they are i only know they seem to be
people of distinction particularly he who advanced to take the lady you
saw in his arms and i say so because all the rest show him respect and
nothing is done except what he directs and orders
and the lady who is she asked the curate
that i cannot tell you either said the servant for i have not seen
her face all the way i have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter
such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time but it
is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you as my comrade
and i have only been in their company two days for having met us on the
road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to andalusia
and have you heard any of them called by his name asked the curate
no indeed replied the servant they all preserve a marvellous
silence on the road for not a sound is to be heard among them except the
poor ladys sighs and sobs which make us pity her and we feel sure that
wherever it is she is going it is against her will and as far as one
can judge from her dress she is a nun or what is more likely about to
become one and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her own
free will that she is so unhappy as she seems to be
that may well be said the curate and leaving them he returned to
where dorothea was who hearing the veiled lady sigh moved by natural
compassion drew near to her and said what are you suffering from
senora if it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to
relieve i offer you my services with all my heart
to this the unhappy lady made no reply and though dorothea repeated her
offers more earnestly she still kept silence until the gentleman with
the veil who the servant said was obeyed by the rest approached and
said to dorothea do not give yourself the trouble senora of making
any offers to that woman for it is her way to give no thanks for
anything that is done for her and do not try to make her answer unless
you want to hear some lie from her lips
i have never told a lie was the immediate reply of her who had been
silent until now on the contrary it is because i am so truthful and so
ignorant of lying devices that i am now in this miserable condition and
this i call you yourself to witness for it is my unstained truth that
cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly being quite close to
the speaker for there was only the door of don quixotes room between
them and the instant he did so uttering a loud exclamation he cried
good god what is this i hear what voice is this that has reached my
ears startled at the voice the lady turned her head and not seeing the
speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room observing which the
gentleman held her back preventing her from moving a step in her
agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her
face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and marvellous
beauty but pale and terrified for she kept turning her eyes everywhere
she could direct her gaze with an eagerness that made her look as if she
had lost her senses and so marked that it excited the pity of dorothea
and all who beheld her though they knew not what caused it the
gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders and being so fully
occupied with holding her back he was unable to put a hand to his veil
which was falling off as it did at length entirely and dorothea who
was holding the lady in her arms raising her eyes saw that he who
likewise held her was her husband don fernando the instant she
recognised him with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of
her heart she fell backwards fainting and but for the barber being
close by to catch her in his arms she would have fallen completely to
the ground the curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw
water on it and as he did so don fernando for he it was who held the
other in his arms recognised her and stood as if death stricken by the
sight not however relaxing his grasp of luscinda for it was she that
was struggling to release herself from his hold having recognised
cardenio by his voice as he had recognised her cardenio also heard
dorotheas cry as she fell fainting and imagining that it came from his
luscinda burst forth in terror from the room and the first thing he saw
was don fernando with luscinda in his arms don fernando too knew
cardenio at once and all three luscinda cardenio and dorothea stood
in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them
they gazed at one another without speaking dorothea at don fernando don
fernando at cardenio cardenio at luscinda and luscinda at cardenio the
first to break silence was luscinda who thus addressed don fernando
leave me senor don fernando for the sake of what you owe to yourself
if no other reason will induce you leave me to cling to the wall of
which i am the ivy to the support from which neither your importunities
nor your threats nor your promises nor your gifts have been able to
detach me see how heaven by ways strange and hidden from our sight has
brought me face to face with my true husband and well you know by
dear bought experience that death alone will be able to efface him from
my memory may this plain declaration then lead you as you can do
nothing else to turn your love into rage your affection into
resentment and so to take my life for if i yield it up in the presence
of my beloved husband i count it well bestowed it may be by my death he
will be convinced that i kept my faith to him to the last moment of
meanwhile dorothea had come to herself and had heard luscindas words
by means of which she divined who she was but seeing that don fernando
did not yet release her or reply to her summoning up her resolution as
well as she could she rose and knelt at his feet and with a flood of
if my lord the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine
arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by
this time that she who kneels at thy feet is so long as thou wilt have
it so the unhappy and unfortunate dorothea i am that lowly peasant girl
whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough
to call herself thine i am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a
contented life until at the voice of thy importunity and thy true and
tender passion as it seemed she opened the gates of her modesty and
surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty a gift received by thee but
thanklessly as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where
thou dost find me and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which
i see thee nevertheless i would not have thee suppose that i have come
here driven by my shame it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself
forgotten by thee that have led me it was thy will to make me thine and
thou didst so follow thy will that now even though thou repentest thou
canst not help being mine bethink thee my lord the unsurpassable
affection i bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for
which thou wouldst desert me thou canst not be the fair luscindas
because thou art mine nor can she be thine because she is cardenios
and it will be easier remember to bend thy will to love one who adores
thee than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now thou didst
address thyself to my simplicity thou didst lay siege to my virtue thou
wert not ignorant of my station well dost thou know how i yielded wholly
to thy will there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception
and if it be so as it is and if thou art a christian as thou art a
gentleman why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy
at last as thou didst at first and if thou wilt not have me for what i
am thy true and lawful wife at least take and accept me as thy slave
for so long as i am thine i will count myself happy and fortunate do not
by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the
streets make not the old age of my parents miserable for the loyal
services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not
deserving of such a return and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood
to mingle it with mine reflect that there is little or no nobility in
the world that has not travelled the same road and that in illustrious
lineages it is not the womans blood that is of account and moreover
that true nobility consists in virtue and if thou art wanting in that
refusing me what in justice thou owest me then even i have higher claims
to nobility than thine to make an end senor these are my last words to
thee whether thou wilt or wilt not i am thy wife witness thy words
which must not and ought not to be false if thou dost pride thyself on
that for want of which thou scornest me witness the pledge which thou
didst give me and witness heaven which thou thyself didst call to
witness the promise thou hadst made me and if all this fail thy own
conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all
thy gaiety and vindicate the truth of what i say and mar thy highest
all this and more the injured dorothea delivered with such earnest
feeling and such tears that all present even those who came with don
fernando were constrained to join her in them don fernando listened to
her without replying until ceasing to speak she gave way to such sobs
and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened
by the sight of so great sorrow luscinda stood regarding her with no
less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence
and beauty and would have gone to her to say some words of comfort to
her but was prevented by don fernandos grasp which held her fast he
overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment after regarding dorothea for
some moments with a fixed gaze opened his arms and releasing luscinda
thou hast conquered fair dorothea thou hast conquered for it is
impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths
luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when
don fernando released her but cardenio who stood near having retreated
behind don fernando to escape recognition casting fear aside and
regardless of what might happen ran forward to support her and said as
he clasped her in his arms if heaven in its compassion is willing to
let thee rest at last mistress of my heart true constant and fair
nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive
thee and received thee before when fortune permitted me to call thee
at these words luscinda looked up at cardenio at first beginning to
recognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that
it was he and hardly knowing what she did and heedless of all
considerations of decorum she flung her arms around his neck and
pressing her face close to his said yes my dear lord you are the
true master of this your slave even though adverse fate interpose again
and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours
a strange sight was this for don fernando and those that stood around
filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for dorothea fancied
that don fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take
vengeance on cardenio for she observed him put his hand to his sword
and the instant the idea struck her with wonderful quickness she clasped
him round the knees and kissing them and holding him so as to prevent
his moving she said while her tears continued to flow what is it thou
wouldst do my only refuge in this unforeseen event thou hast thy wife
at thy feet and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms
of her husband reflect whether it will be right for thee whether it
will be possible for thee to undo what heaven has done or whether it
will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be thy mate who in spite
of every obstacle and strong in her truth and constancy is before thine
eyes bathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her lawful
husband for gods sake i entreat of thee for thine own i implore thee
let not this open manifestation rouse thy anger but rather so calm it as
to allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any
interference from thee so long as heaven permits them and in so doing
thou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit and the world
shall see that with thee reason has more influence than passion
all the time dorothea was speaking cardenio though he held luscinda in
his arms never took his eyes off don fernando determined if he saw him
make any hostile movement to try and defend himself and resist as best
he could all who might assail him though it should cost him his life
but now don fernandos friends as well as the curate and the barber who
had been present all the while not forgetting the worthy sancho panza
ran forward and gathered round don fernando entreating him to have
regard for the tears of dorothea and not suffer her reasonable hopes to
be disappointed since as they firmly believed what she said was but
the truth and bidding him observe that it was not as it might seem by
accident but by a special disposition of providence that they had all
met in a place where no one could have expected a meeting and the curate
bade him remember that only death could part luscinda from cardenio that
even if some sword were to separate them they would think their death
most happy and that in a case that admitted of no remedy his wisest
course was by conquering and putting a constraint upon himself to show
a generous mind and of his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the
happiness heaven had granted them he bade him too turn his eyes upon
the beauty of dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much
less excel her while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the
surpassing love she bore him but besides all this he reminded him that
if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a christian he could not
do otherwise than keep his plighted word and that in doing so he would
obey god and meet the approval of all sensible people who know and
recognised it to be the privilege of beauty even in one of humble birth
provided virtue accompany it to be able to raise itself to the level of
any rank without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with
himself and furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts
itself so long as there be no mixture of sin in it he is not to be
to be brief they added to these such other forcible arguments that don
fernandos manly heart being after all nourished by noble blood was
touched and yielded to the truth which even had he wished it he could
not gainsay and he showed his submission and acceptance of the good
advice that had been offered to him by stooping down and embracing
dorothea saying to her rise dear lady it is not right that what i
hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet and if until now i have
shown no sign of what i own it may have been by heavens decree in order
that seeing the constancy with which you love me i may learn to value
you as you deserve what i entreat of you is that you reproach me not
with my transgression and grievous wrong doing for the same cause and
force that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against
being yours and to prove this turn and look at the eyes of the now
happy luscinda and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors and
as she has found and gained the object of her desires and i have found
in you what satisfies all my wishes may she live in peace and
contentment as many happy years with her cardenio as on my knees i pray
heaven to allow me to live with my dorothea and with these words he
once more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so much
tenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from
completing the proof of his love and repentance in the sight of all not
so luscinda and cardenio and almost all the others for they shed so
many tears some in their own happiness some at that of the others that
one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all even
sancho panza was weeping though afterwards he said he only wept because
he saw that dorothea was not as he fancied the queen micomicona of whom
he expected such great favours their wonder as well as their weeping
lasted some time and then cardenio and luscinda went and fell on their
knees before don fernando returning him thanks for the favour he had
rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer
them and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and
he then asked dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far
removed from her own home and she in a few fitting words told all that
she had previously related to cardenio with which don fernando and his
companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer
so charmingly did dorothea describe her misadventures when she had
finished don fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after
he had found in luscindas bosom the paper in which she declared that she
was cardenios wife and never could be his he said he meant to kill
her and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents and
that he quitted the house full of rage and shame and resolved to avenge
himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer the next day he
learned that luscinda had disappeared from her fathers house and that
no one could tell whither she had gone finally at the end of some
months he ascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there
all the rest of her life if she were not to share it with cardenio and
as soon as he had learned this taking these three gentlemen as his
companions he arrived at the place where she was but avoided speaking
to her fearing that if it were known he was there stricter precautions
would be taken in the convent and watching a time when the porters
lodge was open he left two to guard the gate and he and the other
entered the convent in quest of luscinda whom they found in the
cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns and carrying her off
without giving her time to resist they reached a place with her where
they provided themselves with what they required for taking her away all
which they were able to do in complete safety as the convent was in the
country at a considerable distance from the city he added that when
luscinda found herself in his power she lost all consciousness and after
returning to herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a
word and thus in silence and tears they reached that inn which for him
was reaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an
in which is continued the story of the famous princess micomicona with
to all this sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his
hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke and how the
fair princess micomicona had turned into dorothea and the giant into don
fernando while his master was sleeping tranquilly totally unconscious
of all that had come to pass dorothea was unable to persuade herself
that her present happiness was not all a dream cardenio was in a similar
state of mind and luscindas thoughts ran in the same direction don
fernando gave thanks to heaven for the favour shown to him and for having
been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so
near the destruction of his good name and of his soul and in short
everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the
happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business the curate as a
sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair and
congratulated each upon his good fortune but the one that was in the
highest spirits and good humour was the landlady because of the promise
cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and
damage she had sustained through don quixotes means sancho as has been
already said was the only one who was distressed unhappy and dejected
and so with a long face he went in to his master who had just awoke and
sir rueful countenance your worship may as well sleep on as much as you
like without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her
kingdom to the princess for that is all over and settled now
i should think it was replied don quixote for i have had the most
prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that i ever remember
having had all the days of my life and with one back stroke swish i
brought his head tumbling to the ground and so much blood gushed forth
from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water
like red wine your worship had better say replied sancho for i
would have you know if you dont know it that the dead giant is a
hacked wine skin and the blood four and twenty gallons of red wine that
it had in its belly and the cut off head is the bitch that bore me and
what art thou talking about fool said don quixote art thou in thy
let your worship get up said sancho and you will see the nice
business you have made of it and what we have to pay and you will see
the queen turned into a private lady called dorothea and other things
that will astonish you if you understand them
i shall not be surprised at anything of the kind returned don quixote
for if thou dost remember the last time we were here i told thee that
everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment and it would
be no wonder if it were the same now
i could believe all that replied sancho if my blanketing was the
same sort of thing also only it wasnt but real and genuine for i saw
the landlord who is here to day holding one end of the blanket and
jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly and with as much
laughter as strength and when it comes to be a case of knowing people i
hold for my part simple and sinner as i am that there is no enchantment
about it at all but a great deal of bruising and bad luck
well well god will give a remedy said don quixote hand me my
clothes and let me go out for i want to see these transformations and
sancho fetched him his clothes and while he was dressing the curate
gave don fernando and the others present an account of don quixotes
madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from
that pena pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his ladys
scorn he described to them also nearly all the adventures that sancho
had mentioned at which they marvelled and laughed not a little thinking
it as all did the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be
capable of but now the curate said that the lady dorotheas good
fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose it would be
necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home
cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun and suggested
that luscinda would act and support dorotheas part sufficiently well
no said don fernando that must not be for i want dorothea to follow
out this idea of hers and if the worthy gentlemans village is not very
far off i shall be happy if i can do anything for his relief
it is not more than two days journey from this said the curate
even if it were more said don fernando i would gladly travel so far
for the sake of doing so good a work
at this moment don quixote came out in full panoply with mambrinos
helmet all dinted as it was on his head his buckler on his arm and
leaning on his staff or pike the strange figure he presented filled don
fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow
face half a league long his armour of all sorts and the solemnity of
his deportment they stood silent waiting to see what he would say and
he fixing his eyes on the air dorothea addressed her with great gravity
i am informed fair lady by my squire here that your greatness has been
annihilated and your being abolished since from a queen and lady of
high degree as you used to be you have been turned into a private
maiden if this has been done by the command of the magician king your
father through fear that i should not afford you the aid you need and
are entitled to i may tell you he did not know and does not know half
the mass and was little versed in the annals of chivalry for if he had
read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as i have he
would have found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine have
accomplished things more difficult it is no great matter to kill a whelp
of a giant however arrogant he may be for it is not many hours since i
myself was engaged with one and i will not speak of it that they may
not say i am lying time however that reveals all will tell the tale
you were engaged with a couple of wine skins and not a giant said the
landlord at this but don fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no
account interrupt don quixote who continued i say in conclusion high
and disinherited lady that if your father has brought about this
metamorphosis in your person for the reason i have mentioned you ought
not to attach any importance to it for there is no peril on earth
through which my sword will not force a way and with it before many
days are over i will bring your enemys head to the ground and place on
don quixote said no more and waited for the reply of the princess who
aware of don fernandos determination to carry on the deception until don
quixote had been conveyed to his home with great ease of manner and
gravity made answer whoever told you valiant knight of the rueful
countenance that i had undergone any change or transformation did not
tell you the truth for i am the same as i was yesterday it is true that
certain strokes of good fortune that have given me more than i could
have hoped for have made some alteration in me but i have not therefore
ceased to be what i was before or to entertain the same desire i have
had all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and
invincible arm and so senor let your goodness reinstate the father
that begot me in your good opinion and be assured that he was a wise and
prudent man since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of
remedying my misfortune for i believe senor that had it not been for
you i should never have lit upon the good fortune i now possess and in
this i am saying what is perfectly true as most of these gentlemen who
are present can fully testify all that remains is to set out on our
journey to morrow for to day we could not make much way and for the
rest of the happy result i am looking forward to i trust to god and the
so said the sprightly dorothea and on hearing her don quixote turned to
sancho and said to him with an angry air i declare now little
sancho thou art the greatest little villain in spain say thief and
vagabond hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been
turned into a maiden called dorothea and that the head which i am
persuaded i cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee and other
nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity i have ever been in all
my life i vow and here he looked to heaven and ground his teeth i
have a mind to play the mischief with thee in a way that will teach
sense for the future to all lying squires of knights errant in the
let your worship be calm senor returned sancho for it may well be
that i have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess
micomicona but as to the giants head or at least as to the piercing of
the wine skins and the blood being red wine i make no mistake as sure
as there is a god because the wounded skins are there at the head of
your worships bed and the wine has made a lake of the room if not you
will see when the eggs come to be fried i mean when his worship the
landlord calls for all the damages for the rest i am heartily glad that
her ladyship the queen is as she was for it concerns me as much as
i tell thee again sancho thou art a fool said don quixote forgive
that will do said don fernando let us say no more about it and as
her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to morrow because it is too
late to day so be it and we will pass the night in pleasant
conversation and to morrow we will all accompany senor don quixote for
we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about
to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has
it is i who shall wait upon and accompany you said don quixote and i
am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me and the good
opinion entertained of me which i shall strive to justify or it shall
cost me my life or even more if it can possibly cost me more
many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed
between don quixote and don fernando but they were brought to an end by
a traveller who at this moment entered the inn and who seemed from his
attire to be a christian lately come from the country of the moors for
he was dressed in a short skirted coat of blue cloth with half sleeves
and without a collar his breeches were also of blue cloth and his cap
of the same colour and he wore yellow buskins and had a moorish cutlass
slung from a baldric across his breast behind him mounted upon an ass
there came a woman dressed in moorish fashion with her face veiled and a
scarf on her head and wearing a little brocaded cap and a mantle that
covered her from her shoulders to her feet the man was of a robust and
well proportioned frame in age a little over forty rather swarthy in
complexion with long moustaches and a full beard and in short his
appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been
taken for a person of quality and good birth on entering he asked for a
room and when they told him there was none in the inn he seemed
distressed and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a moor he
her down from saddle in his arms luscinda dorothea the landlady her
daughter and maritornes attracted by the strange and to them entirely
new costume gathered round her and dorothea who was always kindly
courteous and quick witted perceiving that both she and the man who had
brought her were annoyed at not finding a room said to her do not be
put out senora by the discomfort and want of luxuries here for it is
the way of road side inns to be without them still if you will be
pleased to share our lodging with us pointing to luscinda perhaps you
will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey
to this the veiled lady made no reply all she did was to rise from her
seat crossing her hands upon her bosom bowing her head and bending her
body as a sign that she returned thanks from her silence they concluded
that she must be a moor and unable to speak a christian tongue
at this moment the captive came up having been until now otherwise
engaged and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that she
made no reply to what they addressed to her he said ladies this
damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of her
own country for which reason she does not and cannot answer what has
nothing has been asked of her returned luscinda she has only been
offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we
occupy where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances
allow with the good will we are bound to show all strangers that stand
in need of it especially if it be a woman to whom the service is
on her part and my own senora replied the captive i kiss your
hands and i esteem highly as i ought the favour you have offered
which on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance
is it is plain to see a very great one
tell me senor said dorothea is this lady a christian or a moor for
her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could
in dress and outwardly said he she is a moor but at heart she is a
thoroughly good christian for she has the greatest desire to become
then she has not been baptised returned luscinda
there has been no opportunity for that replied the captive since she
left algiers her native country and home and up to the present she has
not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it
necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the
ceremonies our holy mother church ordains but please god ere long she
shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than
by these words he excited a desire in all who heard him to know who the
moorish lady and the captive were but no one liked to ask just then
seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves
than for questioning them about their lives dorothea took the moorish
lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself requested her
to remove her veil she looked at the captive as if to ask him what they
meant and what she was to do he said to her in arabic that they asked
her to take off her veil and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a
countenance so lovely that to dorothea she seemed more beautiful than
luscinda and to luscinda more beautiful than dorothea and all the
bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the
moorish ladys and there were even those who were inclined to give it
somewhat the preference and as it is the privilege and charm of beauty
to win the heart and secure good will all forthwith became eager to show
don fernando asked the captive what her name was and he replied that it
was lela zoraida but the instant she heard him she guessed what the
christian had asked and said hastily with some displeasure and energy
no not zoraida maria maria giving them to understand that she was
called maria and not zoraida these words and the touching
earnestness with which she uttered them drew more than one tear from
some of the listeners particularly the women who are by nature
tender hearted and compassionate luscinda embraced her affectionately
saying yes yes maria maria to which the moor replied yes yes
night was now approaching and by the orders of those who accompanied don
fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the
best supper that was in his power the hour therefore having arrived they
all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one for round or
square table there was none in the inn and the seat of honour at the
head of it though he was for refusing it they assigned to don quixote
who desired the lady micomicona to place herself by his side as he was
her protector luscinda and zoraida took their places next her opposite
to them were don fernando and cardenio and next the captive and the
other gentlemen and by the side of the ladies the curate and the
barber and so they supped in high enjoyment which was increased when
they observed don quixote leave off eating and moved by an impulse like
that which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with
verily gentlemen if we reflect upon it great and marvellous are the
things they see who make profession of the order of knight errantry
say what being is there in this world who entering the gate of this
castle at this moment and seeing us as we are here would suppose or
imagine us to be what we are who would say that this lady who is beside
me was the great queen that we all know her to be or that i am that
knight of the rueful countenance trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of
fame now there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all
those that mankind has invented and is the more deserving of being held
in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril away with
those who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms i will tell
them whosoever they may be that they know not what they say for the
reason which such persons commonly assign and upon which they chiefly
rest is that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the
body and that arms give employment to the body alone as if the calling
were a porters trade for which nothing more is required than sturdy
strength or as if in what we who profess them call arms there were not
included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is
requisite or as if the soul of the warrior when he has an army or the
defence of a city under his care did not exert itself as much by mind as
by body nay see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or
divine the intentions of the enemy his plans stratagems or obstacles
or to ward off impending mischief for all these are the work of the
mind and in them the body has no share whatever since therefore arms
have need of the mind as much as letters let us see now which of the
two minds that of the man of letters or that of the warrior has most to
do and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain
for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler
object the end and goal of letters i am not speaking now of divine
letters the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to heaven for
with an end so infinite no other can be compared i speak of human
letters the end of which is to establish distributive justice give to
every man that which is his and see and take care that good laws are
observed an end undoubtedly noble lofty and deserving of high praise
but not such as should be given to that sought by arms which have for
their end and object peace the greatest boon that men can desire in this
life the first good news the world and mankind received was that which
the angels announced on the night that was our day when they sang in the
air glory to god in the highest and peace on earth to men of
good will and the salutation which the great master of heaven and earth
taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house
was to say peace be on this house and many other times he said to
them my peace i give unto you my peace i leave you peace be with
you a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand a jewel
without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven
this peace is the true end of war and war is only another name for arms
this then being admitted that the end of war is peace and that so far
it has the advantage of the end of letters let us turn to the bodily
labours of the man of letters and those of him who follows the
profession of arms and see which are the greater
don quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct
language that for the time being he made it impossible for any of his
hearers to consider him a madman on the contrary as they were mostly
gentlemen to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth they listened to
him with great pleasure as he continued here then i say is what the
student has to undergo first of all poverty not that all are poor but
to put the case as strongly as possible and when i have said that he
endures poverty i think nothing more need be said about his hard
fortune for he who is poor has no share of the good things of life this
poverty he suffers from in various ways hunger or cold or nakedness
or all together but for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets
something to eat though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and
from the leavings of the rich for the greatest misery of the student is
what they themselves call going out for soup and there is always some
neighbours brazier or hearth for them which if it does not warm at
least tempers the cold to them and lastly they sleep comfortably at
night under a roof i will not go into other particulars as for example
want of shirts and no superabundance of shoes thin and threadbare
garments and gorging themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good
luck has treated them to a banquet of some sort by this road that i have
described rough and hard stumbling here falling there getting up
again to fall again they reach the rank they desire and that once
attained we have seen many who have passed these syrtes and scyllas and
charybdises as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune we
have seen them i say ruling and governing the world from a chair their
hunger turned into satiety their cold into comfort their nakedness into
fine raiment their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask the
justly earned reward of their virtue but contrasted and compared with
what the warrior undergoes all they have undergone falls far short of
it as i am now about to show
which treats of the curious discourse don quixote delivered on arms and
continuing his discourse don quixote said as we began in the students
case with poverty and its accompaniments let us see now if the soldier
is richer and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one
poorer for he is dependent on his miserable pay which comes late or
never or else on what he can plunder seriously imperilling his life and
conscience and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed
doublet serves him for uniform and shirt and in the depth of winter he
has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open
field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth which i need not
say coming from an empty place must come out cold contrary to the laws
of nature to be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make
up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him which unless by
some fault of his never sins by being over narrow for he can easily
measure out on the ground as he likes and roll himself about in it to
his hearts content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from
