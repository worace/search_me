after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the
i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who
advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was
revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim
is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable
which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and
support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place
the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
sacred all embracing teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect
everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the
holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and
life the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur mercury
and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with
salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of
which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination
produces other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence
awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and
paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dolokhov
meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifes absence at the time i gave
him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my
mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected
myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with
anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards boris drubetskoy
came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the
first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up
and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became
silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i
cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set
myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to
my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god
grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave
so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was
drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy day
i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with
my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began
biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and
heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me
to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank i
stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a
fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i
dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and
pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large
and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature
help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the last
which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me
to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my
i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i was
very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered
incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but
as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young
and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order
but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left
the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on the
floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my
sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing
to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying
me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but he
looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i
felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly
found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down
on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down
too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do you
know it i think you know it already abashed by this question i
replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head
incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living
with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of ones embraces and
gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i should
be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and
found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light of
men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it
not joseph alexeevichs face had looked young and bright that day i
received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal
i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that i
was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph
alexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that
the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed
to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast
thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holding
him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair
on his head and his features were quite changed and i said i should
have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am i
telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body then
he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large
book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answered
by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there were
excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings
represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its
pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent
garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and i
seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation
of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt
that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord
help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done but
if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish of
the rostovs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they
though nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little
the way of life at otradnoe mitenkas management of affairs in
particular was such that the debts inevitably increased every year the
only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply
for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one and
also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time
soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to vera and was
though in moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society without
themselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were
provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without
inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them
the rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow
and the most diverse people met at their suppers country neighbors from
otradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters peronskaya a
maid of honor pierre bezukhov and the son of their district postmaster
who had obtained a post in petersburg among the men who very soon
became frequent visitors at the rostovs house in petersburg were boris
pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him
and berg who spent whole days at the rostovs and paid the eldest
daughter countess vera the attentions a young man pays when he intends
not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he
narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had
in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked
up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide de camp standing near
the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander just as he had
done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and so
insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
this and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in 1809
he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some special
though some skeptics smiled when told of bergs merits it could not be
denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms
with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career before
four years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow
theater berg had pointed out vera rostova to him and had said in
german das soll mein weib werden  and from that moment had made up
his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostovs
position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose
bergs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostova but
bergs chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism
that the rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing
since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed
excellent moreover the rostovs affairs were seriously embarrassed as
the suitor could not but know and above all vera was twenty four had
been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly good looking and
sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their
you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend only
because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered
it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it
were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are
now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the baltic
provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortune
and my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying for
money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should bring her share
and a husband his i have my position in the service she has
connections and some means in our times that is worth something isnt
it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves
and i love her because her character is sensible and very good now
the other sister though they are the same family is quite different
an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so
you know unpleasant but my fiancee well you will be coming
he was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take
tea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round
ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness
after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by bergs
proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere
in the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and
constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved vera
sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the old
count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the
cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his
affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted
to or what dowry he could give vera when his daughters were born he
had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three
hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the
other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to vera nor had
berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before
the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the
count thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest at
another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the
wedding berg entered the counts study early one morning and with a
pleasant smile respectfully asked his future father in law to let him
know what veras dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by this
long foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply
that came into his head i like your being businesslike about it i
and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the
conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not
know for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at least
part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off
because consider count if i allowed myself to marry now without
having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly
the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to
avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for
eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the
shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible
for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then a
yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me my
dear fellow ill give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty
natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very year to which she
had counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four years
ago since then she had not seen him before sonya and her mother if
boris happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode
as of some childish long forgotten matter that was not worth
mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether
her engagement to boris was a jest or an important binding promise
since boris left moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
rostovs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near
otradnoe but had never been to see them
sometimes it occurred to natasha that he did not wish to see her and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when
anna mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered when the rostovs came to petersburg boris called
he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was his
most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of letting
her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and
natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant
position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezukhova a
brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an
important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was
beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered
the rostovs drawing room natasha was in her own room when she heard of
his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming
boris remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from
under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her
four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different
natasha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this
well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the
boris kissed natashas hand and said that he was astonished at the
i should think so replied natashas laughing eyes
natasha sat down and without joining in boris conversation with the
countess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor he felt
the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her
boris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at once
he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging
with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling
with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not
accidentally natasha felt that he alluded when speaking of the
highest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and to
invitations he had received from nn and ss
all this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under her
brows this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he looked
round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying
he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the
same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at
him after his first visit boris said to himself that natasha attracted
him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling
because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to
his career while to renew their former relations without intending to
marry her would be dishonorable boris made up his mind to avoid meeting
natasha but despite that resolution he called again a few days later
and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs it
seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natasha and tell
her that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything
she could not be his wife that he had no means and they would never
let her marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about
entering on such an explanation from day to day he became more and more
entangled it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in love
with boris as of old she sang him his favorite songs showed him her
album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the past
letting it be understood how delightful was the present and every day
he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and not
knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end he
left off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her every
day and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovs
one night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket
without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing
under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and natasha also in a
dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
curlpapers ran in the countess her prayerful mood dispelled looked
round and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be that
this couch will be my grave natasha flushed and eager seeing her
mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and
unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that her
mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly
slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and
jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave this
couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
the one below natasha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled
over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her
mother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face but seeing that natashas head was covered she smiled in
mamma can we have a talk yes said natasha now just one on your
throat and another thatll do and seizing her mother round the
neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother
natasha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows
and waited until natasha after turning over a couple of times had
settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and
these visits of natashas at night before the count returned from his
club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter
what is it tonight but i have to tell you
natasha put her hand on her mothers mouth
about boris i know she said seriously thats what i have come
about dont say it i know no do tell me and she removed her hand
natasha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say boris is
nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then what
are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see
as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter natasha was
lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess
only saw her daughters face in profile that face struck her by its
you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you
why not said natasha without changing her position
because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation
natasha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to
her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it
over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the
knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february march
april may speak mamma why dont you say anything speak said she
turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in
that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say
it wont do my love not everyone will understand this friendship
dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may
injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it
torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and
ill tell you some things about myself i had a cousin
i know cyril matveich but he is old
he was not always old but this is what ill do natasha ill have a
talk with boris he need not come so often
because i know it will end in nothing
how can you know no mamma dont speak to him what nonsense said
natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property well i
wont marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natasha
smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just so she added
just so theres no need for me to marry him but just so
just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she
went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh
dont laugh stop cried natasha youre shaking the whole bed
youre awfully like me just such another giggler wait and she
seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger
saying june and continued kissing july august on the other
hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you think was
anybody ever so much in love with you and hes very nice very very
nice only not quite my taste he is so narrow like the dining room
clock dont you understand narrow you know gray light gray
natasha continued dont you really understand nicholas would
understand bezukhov now is blue dark blue and red and he is
you flirt with him too said the countess laughing
no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine dark blue and
red how can i explain it to you
little countess the counts voice called from behind the door
youre not asleep natasha jumped up snatched up her slippers and
it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her
sonya she thought glancing at that curled up sleeping little kitten
with her enormous plait of hair no how could she shes virtuous she
fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even
mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how
charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person
and imagining it was some very wise man the wisest and best of men who
was saying it of her there is everything everything in her
continued this man she is unusually intelligent charming and then
she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agile she swims and rides
splendidly and her voice one can really say its a wonderful voice
she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself
on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
fall asleep called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before
dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in
reality and even more so because it was different
next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him after
on the thirty first of december new years eve 1809 10 an old
grandee of catherines day was giving a ball and midnight supper the
diplomatic corps and the emperor himself were to be present
the grandees well known mansion on the english quay glittered with
innumerable lights police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
which was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of
police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch
carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with red liveried
footmen and footmen in plumed hats from the carriages emerged men
wearing uniforms stars and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine
cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
the emperor no a minister prince ambassador dont you see
one person better dressed than the rest seemed to know everyone and
mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day
a third of the visitors had already arrived but the rostovs who were
to be present were still hurrying to get dressed
there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
rostov family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that the
dresses would not be ready or that something would not be arranged as
marya ignatevna peronskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at the
court of the dowager empress who was a friend and relation of the
countess and piloted the provincial rostovs in petersburg high society
they were to call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten
oclock but it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were not
natasha was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight that
morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day all
her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
all she herself mamma and sonya should be as well dressed as
possible sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands the
countess was to wear a claret colored velvet dress and the two girls
white gauze over pink silk slips with roses on their bodices and their
everything essential had already been done feet hands necks and ears
washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the openwork silk
stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on the
hairdressing was almost done sonya was finishing dressing and so was
the countess but natasha who had bustled about helping them all was
behindhand she was still sitting before a looking glass with a dressing
jacket thrown over her slender shoulders sonya stood ready dressed in
the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
thats not the way thats not the way sonya cried natasha turning
her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who
was dressing it had not time to release that bow is not right come
sonya sat down and natasha pinned the ribbon on differently
allow me miss i cant do it like that said the maid who was holding
oh dear well then wait thats right sonya
arent you ready it is nearly ten came the countess voice
i have only my cap to pin on
dont do it without me called natasha you wont do it right
they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and natasha had
still to get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens
when her hair was done natasha in her short petticoat from under which
her dancing shoes showed and in her mothers dressing jacket ran up to
sonya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother turning her mothers
head this way and that she fastened on the cap and hurriedly kissing
her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her
the cause of the delay was natashas skirt which was too long two
maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
thread a third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
countess and sonya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
whenever will you be ready asked the count coming to the door here
is some scent peronskaya must be tired of waiting
its ready miss said the maid holding up the shortened gauze dress
with two fingers and blowing and shaking something off it as if by
this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she
in a minute in a minute dont come in papa she cried to her father
as he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt which still
sonya slammed the door to a minute later they let the count in he was
wearing a blue swallow tail coat shoes and stockings and was perfumed
oh papa how nice you look charming cried natasha as she stood in
the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze
if you please miss allow me said the maid who on her knees was
pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
say what you like exclaimed sonya in a despairing voice as she
looked at natasha say what you like its still too long
natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass the dress was
really madam it is not at all too long said mavra crawling on her
well if its too long well tack it up well tack it up in one
minute said the resolute dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on
the front of her little shawl and still kneeling on the floor set to
at that moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap
oo oo my beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than any of
he would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside fearing to
mamma your cap more to this side said natasha ill arrange it
and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt
could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off
oh goodness what has happened really it was not my fault
never mind ill run it up it wont show said dunyasha
what a beauty a very queen said the nurse as she came to the door
at a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started
but they had still to call at the taurida gardens
peronskaya was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she had
gone through the same process as the rostovs but with less flurry for
to her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was washed
perfumed and powdered in just the same way she had washed behind her
ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing room in her
yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old ladys maid
was as full of rapturous admiration as the rostovs servants had been
she praised the rostovs toilets they praised her taste and toilet and
at eleven oclock careful of their coiffures and dresses they settled
natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
had time to think of what lay before her
in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball in those brightly lighted rooms with music flowers dances
the emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the
prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true so
out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping
over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her
fur cloak and beside sonya and in front of her mother mounted the
brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did she
remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic
air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion but
fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing
clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed
at her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made her
ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
with all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that
became her best before and behind them other visitors were entering
also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the
landing reflected ladies in white pale blue and pink dresses with
diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms
natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession on
entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and
greetings deafened natasha and the light and glitter dazzled her still
more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door
for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals
charme de vous voir  greeted the rostovs and peronskaya in the same
the two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her black
hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarily
rested longer on the slim natasha she looked at her and gave her alone
a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess looking at
her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her own
girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natasha with his
eyes and asked the count which was his daughter
charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers
in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the
emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows of
that crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about
her and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked her
there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought
peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at
that is the dutch ambassador do you see that gray haired man she
said indicating an old man with a profusion of silver gray curly hair
who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said
ah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bezukhova said
peronskaya indicating helene who had just entered how lovely she is
quite equal to marya antonovna see how the men young and old pay
court to her beautiful and clever they say prince is quite mad
about her but see those two though not good looking are even more
she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and look
that is bezukhovas brother anatole kuragin she said indicating a
handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erect
looking at something over the heads of the ladies hes handsome isnt
he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl but your cousin
drubetskoy is also very attentive to her they say she has millions oh
yes thats the french ambassador himself she replied to the countess
inquiry about caulaincourt looks as if he were a king all the same
the french are charming very charming no one more charming in society
ah here she is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our
marya antonovna and how simply she is dressed lovely and that stout
one in spectacles is the universal freemason she went on indicating
pierre put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon
pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd
and nodding to right and left as casually and good naturedly as if he
were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently
natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon
as peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for
her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce
but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark
man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window
talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natasha at once
recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was
bolkonski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and
theres someone else we know bolkonski do you see mamma said
natasha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a night
oh you know him said peronskaya i cant bear him il fait a
present la pluie et le beau temps  hes too proud for anything takes
after his father and hes hand in glove with speranski writing some
project or other just look how he treats the ladies theres one
talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him id
give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies
suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then
back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to
the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked
his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as
if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band
played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts you
ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd
made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces
hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from the
drawing room door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the
hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies
asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete
forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the
detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take
everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing
room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music
the host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina then came
ambassadors ministers and various generals whom peronskaya diligently
named more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking
up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natasha
felt that she would be left with her mother and sonya among a minority
of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance
she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom
rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering
frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the
height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any
of those great people whom peronskaya was pointing out she had but one
thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among
the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men will
notice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as
if they were saying ah shes not the one im after so its not worth
looking at her no its impossible she thought they must know how
i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy
the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable
time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natashas ears she
wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the other end
of the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves
as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one
interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady
passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was
smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natasha as one
looks at a wall boris passed them twice and each time turned away berg
and his wife who were not dancing came up to them
this family gathering seemed humiliating to natasha as if there were
nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not
listen to or look at vera who was telling her something about her own
at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced with
three and the music ceased a worried aide de camp ran up to the
rostovs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they
were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the
distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperor
looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun
dancing an aide de camp the master of ceremonies went up to countess
bezukhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and laid
it on his shoulder without looking at him the aide de camp an adept in
his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident
deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the
circle then at the corner of the room he caught helenes left hand and
turned her the only sound audible apart from the ever quickening
music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet
while at every third beat his partners velvet dress spread out and
seemed to flash as she whirled round natasha gazed at them and was
ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of
prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing
stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the
front row of the circle not far from the rostovs baron firhoff was
talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be
held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranski
and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give
reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors
were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle
prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the emperors presence
and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance
pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm
you always dance i have a protegee the young rostova here ask her
where is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to the
baron we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball one must
dance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated the
despairing dejected expression of natashas face caught his eye he
recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debut
remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of
allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with
i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess
remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
belying peronskayas remarks about his rudeness and approaching natasha
he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his
invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on
natashas face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly
i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl
seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she
raised her hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the second couple
to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his
day and natasha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white satin
dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of
herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare
arms and neck were not beautiful compared to helenes her shoulders
looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but helene seemed as it were
hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned
her person while natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time
who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this
prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as
possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to
him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked
caused by the emperors presence he danced and had chosen natasha
because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that
slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felt
himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
after prince andrew boris came up to ask natasha for a dance and then
