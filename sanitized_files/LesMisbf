a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm and he was at once both
let us not insult the gods said he the gods may not have taken

dreams you say well even in nature such as it is to day after the
flight of these dreams we still find all the grand old pagan myths
such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel like the
vignemale for example is still to me the headdress of cybele it has
not been proved to me that pan does not come at night to breathe into
the hollow trunks of the willows stopping up the holes in turn with his
fingers and i have always believed that io had something to do with the
in the last corner they were talking politics the charter which had
been granted was getting roughly handled combeferre was upholding it
weakly courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it on the table
lay an unfortunate copy of the famous touquet charter courfeyrac had
seized it and was brandishing it mingling with his arguments the
in the first place i wont have any kings if it were only from an
economical point of view i dont want any a king is a parasite one
does not have kings gratis listen to this the dearness of kings at
the death of francois i the national debt of france amounted to an
income of thirty thousand livres at the death of louis xiv it was two
milliards six hundred millions at twenty eight livres the mark which
was equivalent in 1760 according to desmarets to four milliards five
hundred millions which would to day be equivalent to twelve milliards
in the second place and no offence to combeferre a charter granted is
but a poor expedient of civilization to save the transition to soften
the passage to deaden the shock to cause the nation to pass insensibly
from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional
fictions what detestable reasons all those are no no let us never
enlighten the people with false daylight principles dwindle and pale
in your constitutional cellar no illegitimacy no compromise no grant
from the king to the people in all such grants there is an article 14
by the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches
back i refuse your charter point blank a charter is a mask the lie
lurks beneath it a people which accepts a charter abdicates the law is
only the law when entire no no charter
it was winter a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace this
was tempting and courfeyrac could not resist he crumpled the poor
touquet charter in his fist and flung it in the fire the paper
flashed up combeferre watched the masterpiece of louis xviii burn
and sarcasms sallies jests that french thing which is called entrain
and that english thing which is called humor good and bad taste
good and bad reasons all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue mounting
together and crossing from all points of the room produced a sort of
the shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable
property that one can never foresee the spark nor divine the lightning
flash what will dart out presently no one knows the burst of laughter
at the moment of jest the serious makes its entry impulses depend on
the first chance word the spirit of each is sovereign jest suffices
to open the field to the unexpected these are conversations with
abrupt turns in which the perspective changes suddenly chance is the
a severe thought starting oddly from a clash of words suddenly
traversed the conflict of quips in which grantaire bahorel prouvaire
how does a phrase crop up in a dialogue whence comes it that it
suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it we
have just said that no one knows anything about it in the midst of the
uproar bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to combeferre
at this name of waterloo marius who was leaning his elbows on a table
beside a glass of water removed his wrist from beneath his chin and
pardieu exclaimed courfeyrac parbleu was falling into disuse
at this period that number 18 is strange and strikes me it is
bonapartes fatal number place louis in front and brumaire behind you
have the whole destiny of the man with this significant peculiarity
that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement
enjolras who had remained mute up to that point broke the silence and
you mean to say the crime and the expiation
this word crime overpassed the measure of what marius who was already
greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of waterloo could accept
he rose walked slowly to the map of france spread out on the wall and
at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment laid his
corsica a little island which has rendered france very great
this was like a breath of icy air all ceased talking they felt that
bahorel replying to bossuet was just assuming an attitude of the torso
to which he was addicted he gave it up to listen
enjolras whose blue eye was not fixed on any one and who seemed to be
gazing at space replied without glancing at marius
france needs no corsica to be great france is great because she is
marius felt no desire to retreat he turned towards enjolras and his
voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very
god forbid that i should diminish france but amalgamating napoleon
with her is not diminishing her come let us argue the question i am
a new comer among you but i will confess that you amaze me where do we
stand who are we who are you who am i let us come to an explanation
about the emperor i hear you say buonaparte accenting the u like the
royalists i warn you that my grandfather does better still he
says buonaparte i thought you were young men where then is your
enthusiasm and what are you doing with it whom do you admire if you
do not admire the emperor and what more do you want if you will
have none of that great man what great men would you like he had
everything he was complete he had in his brain the sum of human
faculties he made codes like justinian he dictated like caesar his
conversation was mingled with the lightning flash of pascal with the
thunderclap of tacitus he made history and he wrote it his bulletins
are iliads he combined the cipher of newton with the metaphor of
mahomet he left behind him in the east words as great as the pyramids
at tilsit he taught emperors majesty at the academy of sciences he
replied to laplace in the council of state be held his own against
merlin he gave a soul to the geometry of the first and to the
chicanery of the last he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal
with the astronomers like cromwell blowing out one of two candles he
went to the temple to bargain for a curtain tassel he saw everything
he knew everything which did not prevent him from laughing
good naturedly beside the cradle of his little child and all at once
frightened europe lent an ear armies put themselves in motion parks of
artillery rumbled pontoons stretched over the rivers clouds of cavalry
galloped in the storm cries trumpets a trembling of thrones in every
direction the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map the sound
of a superhuman sword was heard as it was drawn from its sheath they
beheld him him rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his
hand and a glow in his eyes unfolding amid the thunder his two wings
the grand army and the old guard and he was the archangel of war
all held their peace and enjolras bowed his head silence always
produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence of the enemy being driven
to the wall marius continued with increased enthusiasm and almost
let us be just my friends what a splendid destiny for a nation to be
the empire of such an emperor when that nation is france and when it
adds its own genius to the genius of that man to appear and to reign
to march and to triumph to have for halting places all capitals to
take his grenadiers and to make kings of them to decree the falls of
dynasties and to transfigure europe at the pace of a charge to make
you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the
sword of god to follow in a single man hannibal caesar charlemagne
to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling
announcement of a battle won to have the cannon of the invalides to
rouse you in the morning to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words
which flame forever marengo arcola austerlitz jena wagram to cause
constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the
zenith of the centuries to make the french empire a pendant to the
roman empire to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand
army to make its legions fly forth over all the earth as a mountain
sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer to dominate to strike
with lightning to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory
to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet blast of titans to conquer
the world twice by conquest and by dazzling that is sublime and what
marius lowered his head in his turn that cold and simple word had
traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel and he felt it
vanishing within him when he raised his eyes combeferre was no longer
there probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis he had
just taken his departure and all with the exception of enjolras
had followed him the room had been emptied enjolras left alone with
marius was gazing gravely at him marius however having rallied his
ideas to some extent did not consider himself beaten there lingered in
him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point no doubt of
translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against enjolras when all of
a sudden they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went it was
combeferre and this is what he was singing
the wild and tender accents with which combeferre sang communicated to
this couplet a sort of strange grandeur marius thoughtfully and
with his eyes diked on the ceiling repeated almost mechanically my
at that moment he felt enjolras hand on his shoulder
citizen said enjolras to him my mother is the republic
that evening left marius profoundly shaken and with a melancholy shadow
in his soul he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment
when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited
within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy
marius was gloomy he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject
it already he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to
himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of
himself to stand between two religions from one of which you have
not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is
intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls marius
was clear eyed and he required the true light the half lights of doubt
pained him whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was
he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to
advance to examine to think to march further whither would this lead
him he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him
nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from
that father his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which
occurred to him an escarpment rose around him he was in accord neither
with his grandfather nor with his friends daring in the eyes of
the one he was behind the times in the eyes of the others and he
recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated on the side of age and
on the side of youth he ceased to go to the cafe musain
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of
certain serious sides of existence the realities of life do not allow
themselves to be forgotten they soon elbowed him abruptly
one morning the proprietor of the hotel entered marius room and said
request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius
courfeyrac having made his appearance the host left them marius then
told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate that he was
the same as alone in the world and had no relatives
what is to become of you said courfeyrac
i do not know in the least replied marius
do you want me to lend you some
i know a clothes dealer who will take your frock coat and a pair of
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a
what you will not go barefoot what opulence
i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch
no it is not good what will you do after that
whatever is necessary anything honest that is to say
because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an
encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german
articles it is badly paid work but one can live by it
in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch
the clothes dealer was sent for he paid twenty francs for the cast off
garments they went to the watchmakers he bought the watch for
that is not bad said marius to courfeyrac on their return to the
hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot it
the deuce exclaimed courfeyrac you will eat up five francs while
you are learning english and five while learning german that will be
swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
in the meantime aunt gillenormand a rather good hearted person at
bottom in difficulties had finally hunted up marius abode
one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter
from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter
in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that
he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs at that moment
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of
exasperating him besides had he not said let me never hear the name
marius left the hotel de la porte saint jacques as he did not wish to
life became hard for marius it was nothing to eat his clothes and his
watch he ate of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la
vache enrage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations
a terrible thing it is containing days without bread nights without
sleep evenings without a candle a hearth without a fire weeks without
work a future without hope a coat out at the elbows an old hat which
evokes the laughter of young girls a door which one finds locked on one
at night because ones rent is not paid the insolence of the porter
and the cook shop man the sneers of neighbors humiliations dignity
trampled on work of whatever nature accepted disgusts bitterness
despondency marius learned how all this is eaten and how such are
often the only things which one has to devour at that moment of his
existence when a man needs his pride because he needs love he felt
that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous
because he was poor at the age when youth swells the heart with
imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated
boots and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of
wretchedness admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge
base from which the strong emerge sublime a crucible into which
destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi god
for many great deeds are performed in petty combats there are instances
of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by
step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes noble and
mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds which are requited with no
renown which are saluted with no trumpet blast life misfortune
isolation abandonment poverty are the fields of battle which have
their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the
firm and rare natures are thus created misery almost always a
step mother is sometimes a mother destitution gives birth to might of
soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride unhappiness is a good
there came a moment in marius life when he swept his own landing when
he bought his sous worth of brie cheese at the fruiterers when he
waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the bakers and purchase
a loaf which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had
stolen it sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butchers shop
on the corner in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him an
awkward young man carrying big books under his arm who had a timid yet
angry air who on entering removed his hat from a brow whereon stood
drops of perspiration made a profound bow to the butchers astonished
wife asked for a mutton cutlet paid six or seven sous for it wrapped
it up in a paper put it under his arm between two books and went
away it was marius on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he
on the first day he ate the meat on the second he ate the fat on the
third he gnawed the bone aunt gillenormand made repeated attempts and
sent him the sixty pistoles several times marius returned them on every
he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we
have just described was effected within him from that time forth he
had not put off his black garments but his garments were quitting him
the day came when he had no longer a coat the trousers would go next
what was to be done courfeyrac to whom he had on his side done some
good turns gave him an old coat for thirty sous marius got it turned
by some porter or other and it was a new coat but this coat was green
then marius ceased to go out until after nightfall this made his coat
black as he wished always to appear in mourning he clothed himself
in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer he was
supposed to live in courfeyracs room which was decent and where
a certain number of law books backed up and completed by several
dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the
regulations he had his letters addressed to courfeyracs quarters
when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact
in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect m
gillenormand trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four
pieces and threw it into the waste basket two or three days later
mademoiselle gillenormand heard her father who was alone in his room
talking aloud to himself he always did this whenever he was greatly
agitated she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a
fool you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same
it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else it ends by
becoming bearable it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself one
vegetates that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion
which is however sufficient for life this is the mode in which the
he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a
little in front of him by dint of toil perseverance courage and
will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a
year he had learned german and english thanks to courfeyrac who had
put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled
the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing
house he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated
editions compiled biographies etc net product year in and year
out seven hundred francs he lived on it how not so badly we will
marius occupied in the gorbeau house for an annual sum of thirty
francs a den minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only
the most indispensable articles of furniture this furniture belonged
to him he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come
and sweep his hole and to bring him a little hot water every morning
a fresh egg and a penny roll he breakfasted on this egg and roll his
breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs
were dear or cheap at six oclock in the evening he descended the
rue saint jacques to dine at rousseaus opposite bassets the
stamp dealers on the corner of the rue des mathurins he ate no soup
he took a six sou plate of meat a half portion of vegetables for three
sous and a three sou dessert for three sous he got as much bread as
he wished as for wine he drank water when he paid at the desk
where madam rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically
presided he gave a sou to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a
smile then he went away for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner
this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes
were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant it no
longer exists the proprietor had a fine nickname he was called
thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty
sous a day which made three hundred and sixty five francs a year add
the thirty francs for rent and the thirty six francs to the old woman
plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred and fifty francs marius
was fed lodged and waited on his clothing cost him a hundred francs
his linen fifty francs his washing fifty francs the whole did not
exceed six hundred and fifty francs he was rich he sometimes lent ten
francs to a friend courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs
of him as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had
marius always had two complete suits of clothes the one old for every
day the other brand new for special occasions both were black he
had but three shirts one on his person the second in the commode and
the third in the washerwomans hands he renewed them as they wore out
they were always ragged which caused him to button his coat to the
it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing
condition hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to
climb marius had not failed for a single day he had endured everything
in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts
he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou
a debt was to him the beginning of slavery he even said to himself
that a creditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only
your person a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to
it a box on the ear rather than borrow he went without food he had
passed many a day fasting feeling that all extremes meet and that
if one is not on ones guard lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of
soul he kept a jealous watch on his pride such and such a formality
or action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a
deference to him now seemed insipidity and he nerved himself against
it his face wore a sort of severe flush he was timid even to rudeness
during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even
uplifted at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself
the soul aids the body and at certain moments raises it it is the
only bird which bears up its own cage
besides his fathers name another name was graven in marius heart
the name of thenardier marius with his grave and enthusiastic nature
surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thoughts
he owed his fathers life that intrepid sergeant who had saved the
colonel amid the bullets and the cannon balls of waterloo he never
separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and
he associated them in his veneration it was a sort of worship in two
steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for
thenardier what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards
thenardier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that
thenardier had fallen and which had engulfed the latter marius had
learned at montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate
inn keeper since that time he had made unheard of efforts to find
traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which
thenardier had disappeared marius had beaten the whole country he
had gone to chelles to bondy to gourney to nogent to lagny he had
persisted for three years expending in these explorations the little
money which he had laid by no one had been able to give him any news of
thenardier he was supposed to have gone abroad his creditors had also
sought him with less love than marius but with as much assiduity and
had not been able to lay their hands on him marius blamed himself and
was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches
it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a
matter of honor to pay it what he thought when my father lay dying
on the field of battle did thenardier contrive to find him amid the
smoke and the grape shot and bear him off on his shoulders and yet he
owed him nothing and i who owe so much to thenardier cannot join him
in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my
turn bring him back from death to life oh i will find him to find
thenardier in fact marius would have given one of his arms to rescue
him from his misery he would have sacrificed all his blood to see
thenardier to render thenardier some service to say to him you do
not know me well i do know you here i am dispose of me this was
at this epoch marius was twenty years of age it was three years since
he had left his grandfather both parties had remained on the same
terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to
see each other besides what was the use of seeing each other marius
was the brass vase while father gillenormand was the iron pot
we admit that marius was mistaken as to his grandfathers heart he had
imagined that m gillenormand had never loved him and that that crusty
harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed
and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that
affection which is at once slight and severe of the dotards of comedy
marius was in error there are fathers who do not love their children
there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson at bottom
as we have said m gillenormand idolized marius he idolized him after
his own fashion with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the
ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart
he would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while
secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed at first he hoped that
this buonapartist this jacobin this terrorist this septembrist would
return but the weeks passed by years passed to m gillenormands
great despair the blood drinker did not make his appearance i could
not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself
and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do
it his pride instantly answered yes but his aged head which he
shook in silence replied sadly no he had his hours of depression
he missed marius old men need affection as they need the sun it is
warmth strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some
change in him nothing in the world could have induced him to take a
step towards that rogue but he suffered he never inquired about him
but he thought of him incessantly he lived in the marais in a more and
more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but
his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violences always
terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection he sometimes said
oh if he only would return what a good box on the ear i would give
as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no
longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually
came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the
paroquet which she probably had what augmented father gillenormands
secret suffering was that he locked it all up within his breast and
did not allow its existence to be divined his sorrow was like those
recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke it sometimes
happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked
him what is your grandson doing what has become of him the old
bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a
fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay monsieur le baron de
pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other
while the old man regretted marius applauded himself as is the case
with all good hearted people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness
he only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light but he had set
his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been
unkind to his father this was the mitigated translation of his first
indignation moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering
still it was for his fathers sake the hardness of his life satisfied
and pleased him he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was
certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had
it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and
later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a
father that it would not have been just that his father should have all
the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his
toils and his destitution compared with the colonels heroic life that
in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him
was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant
before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had
meant to imply by the words he will be worthy of it words which
marius continued to wear not on his breast since the colonels writing
and then on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors
he had been only a child now he was a man he felt it misery we
repeat had been good for him poverty in youth when it succeeds has
this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards
effort and the whole soul towards aspiration poverty instantly lays
material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds
towards the ideal life the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and
brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming
good repasts and all the rest of it occupations for the baser side
of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides
the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has
eaten he has nothing more but meditation he goes to the spectacles
which god furnishes gratis he gazes at the sky space the stars
flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering the
creation amid which he beams he gazes so much on humanity that he
perceives its soul he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he
beholds god he dreams he feels himself great he dreams on and feels
himself tender from the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the
compassion of the man who meditates an admirable sentiment breaks forth
in him forgetfulness of self and pity for all as he thinks of the
innumerable enjoyments which nature offers gives and lavishes to souls
which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to
pity he the millionnaire of the mind the millionnaire of money all
hatred departs from his heart in proportion as light penetrates his
spirit and is he unhappy no the misery of a young man is never
miserable the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may
be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes
his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white
teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor
and then every morning he sets himself afresh to the task of earning
his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column
gains pride his brain gathers ideas his task finished he returns to
ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joys he beholds his feet set
in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes
in the mire his head in the light he is firm serene gentle peaceful
attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for
having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich
man lacks work which makes him free and thought which makes him
this is what had happened with marius to tell the truth he inclined a
little too much to the side of contemplation from the day when he had
succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had
stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrenching time from his work
to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days
in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute
voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance he had thus propounded
the problem of his life to toil as little as possible at material
labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is
impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to
cast the rest to the infinite as he believed that he lacked nothing he
did not perceive that contemplation thus understood ends by becoming
one of the forms of idleness that he was contenting himself with
conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from
it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this
could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against
the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken
in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father
gillenormand thought about the matter he was not practising he was
not even pettifogging meditation had turned him aside from pleading to
haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cases what a bore why
should he do it he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his
livelihood the obscure and ill paid publishing establishment had come
to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much
labor as we have explained and which sufficed for his wants
one of the publishers for whom he worked m magimel i think offered
to take him into his own house to lodge him well to furnish him with
regular occupation and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year to be
well lodged fifteen hundred francs no doubt but renounce his liberty
be on fixed wages a sort of hired man of letters according to marius
opinion if he accepted his position would become both better and worse
at the same time he acquired comfort and lost his dignity it was a
fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous
state of torture something like the case of a blind man who should
recover the sight of one eye he refused
marius dwelt in solitude owing to his taste for remaining outside of
everything and through having been too much alarmed he had not entered
decidedly into the group presided over by enjolras they had remained
good friends they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every
possible way but nothing more marius had two friends one young
courfeyrac and one old m mabeuf he inclined more to the old man
in the first place he owed to him the revolution which had taken
place within him to him he was indebted for having known and loved his
father he operated on me for a cataract he said
the churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part
it was not however that m mabeuf had been anything but the calm and
impassive agent of providence in this connection he had enlightened
marius by chance and without being aware of the fact as does a candle
which some one brings he had been the candle and not the some one
as for marius inward political revolution m mabeuf was totally
incapable of comprehending it of willing or of directing it
as we shall see m mabeuf again later on a few words will not be
on the day when m mabeuf said to marius certainly i approve of
political opinions he expressed the real state of his mind all
political opinions were matters of indifference to him and he approved
them all without distinction provided they left him in peace as the
greeks called the furies the beautiful the good the charming the
eumenides m mabeufs political opinion consisted in a passionate love
for plants and above all for books like all the rest of the world
he possessed the termination in ist without which no one could exist at
that time but he was neither a royalist a bonapartist a chartist
an orleanist nor an anarchist he was a bouquinist a collector of old
books he did not understand how men could busy themselves with
hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter democracy
legitimacy monarchy the republic etc when there were in the world
all sorts of mosses grasses and shrubs which they might be looking at
and heaps of folios and even of 32mos which they might turn over he
took good care not to become useless having books did not prevent his
reading being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener when
he made pontmercys acquaintance this sympathy had existed between the
colonel and himself that what the colonel did for flowers he did for
fruits m mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory
as the pears of st germain it is from one of his combinations
apparently that the october mirabelle now celebrated and no less
perfumed than the summer mirabelle owes its origin he went to mass
rather from gentleness than from piety and because as he loved the
faces of men but hated their noise he found them assembled and silent
only in church feeling that he must be something in the state he had
chosen the career of warden however he had never succeeded in loving
any woman as much as a tulip bulb nor any man as much as an elzevir
he had long passed sixty when one day some one asked him have you
never been married i have forgotten said he when it sometimes
happened to him and to whom does it not happen to say oh if i were
only rich it was not when ogling a pretty girl as was the case with
father gillenormand but when contemplating an old book he lived alone
with an old housekeeper he was somewhat gouty and when he was asleep
his aged fingers stiffened with rheumatism lay crooked up in the folds
of his sheets he had composed and published a flora of the environs of
cauteretz with colored plates a work which enjoyed a tolerable
measure of esteem and which sold well people rang his bell in the rue
mesieres two or three times a day to ask for it he drew as much as
two thousand francs a year from it this constituted nearly the whole of
his fortune although poor he had had the talent to form for himself
by dint of patience privations and time a precious collection of rare
copies of every sort he never went out without a book under his arm
and he often returned with two the sole decoration of the four rooms
on the ground floor which composed his lodgings consisted of framed
herbariums and engravings of the old masters the sight of a sword or
a gun chilled his blood he had never approached a cannon in his life
even at the invalides he had a passable stomach a brother who was a
cure perfectly white hair no teeth either in his mouth or his mind a
trembling in every limb a picard accent an infantile laugh the air of
an old sheep and he was easily frightened add to this that he had no
other friendship no other acquaintance among the living than an old
bookseller of the porte saint jacques named royal his dream was to
his servant was also a sort of innocent the poor good old woman was a
spinster sultan her cat which might have mewed allegris miserere in
the sixtine chapel had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity
of passion which existed in her none of her dreams had ever proceeded
as far as man she had never been able to get further than her cat like
him she had a mustache her glory consisted in her caps which were
always white she passed her time on sundays after mass in counting
over the linen in her chest and in spreading out on her bed the dresses
in the piece which she bought and never had made up she knew how to
read m mabeuf had nicknamed her mother plutarque
m mabeuf had taken a fancy to marius because marius being young and
gentle warmed his age without startling his timidity youth combined
with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without
wind when marius was saturated with military glory with gunpowder
with marches and countermarches and with all those prodigious battles
in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the
sword he went to see m mabeuf and m mabeuf talked to him of his hero
his brother the cure died about 1830 and almost immediately as when
the night is drawing on the whole horizon grew dark for m mabeuf a
notarys failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs which
was all that he possessed in his brothers right and his own the
revolution of july brought a crisis to publishing in a period of
embarrassment the first thing which does not sell is a flora the flora
of the environs of cauteretz stopped short weeks passed by without a
single purchaser sometimes m mabeuf started at the sound of the bell
monsieur said mother plutarque sadly it is the water carrier
in short one day m mabeuf quitted the rue mesieres abdicated the
functions of warden gave up saint sulpice sold not a part of his
books but of his prints that to which he was the least attached and
installed himself in a little house on the rue montparnasse where
however he remained but one quarter for two reasons in the first
place the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he
dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent in the second
being near fatons shooting gallery he could hear the pistol shots
he carried off his flora his copper plates his herbariums his
portfolios and his books and established himself near the salpetriere
in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of austerlitz where
for fifty crowns a year he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a
hedge and containing a well he took advantage of this removal to sell
off nearly all his furniture on the day of his entrance into his new
quarters he was very gay and drove the nails on which his engravings
and herbariums were to hang with his own hands dug in his garden the
rest of the day and at night perceiving that mother plutarque had a
melancholy air and was very thoughtful he tapped her on the shoulder
and said to her with a smile we have the indigo
only two visitors the bookseller of the porte saint jacques and marius
were admitted to view the thatched cottage at austerlitz a brawling
name which was to tell the truth extremely disagreeable to him
however as we have just pointed out brains which are absorbed in some
bit of wisdom or folly or as it often happens in both at once are
but slowly accessible to the things of actual life their own destiny
is a far off thing to them there results from such concentration a
passivity which if it were the outcome of reasoning would resemble
philosophy one declines descends trickles away even crumbles away
and yet is hardly conscious of it ones self it always ends it is
true in an awakening but the awakening is tardy in the meantime it
seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on
between our happiness and our unhappiness we are the stake and we look
it is thus that athwart the cloud which formed about him when all his
hopes were extinguished one after the other m mabeuf remained rather
puerilely but profoundly serene his habits of mind had the regular
swing of a pendulum once mounted on an illusion he went for a very
long time even after the illusion had disappeared a clock does not
stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost
m mabeuf had his innocent pleasures these pleasures were inexpensive
and unexpected the merest chance furnished them one day mother
plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room she was
reading aloud finding that she understood better thus to read aloud is
to assure ones self of what one is reading there are people who read
very loud and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word
of honor as to what they are perusing
it was with this sort of energy that mother plutarque was reading the
romance which she had in hand m mabeuf heard her without listening to
in the course of her reading mother plutarque came to this phrase it
was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty
here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses
bouddha and the dragon struck in m mabeuf in a low voice yes it
is true that there was a dragon which from the depths of its cave
spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire many stars
had already been consumed by this monster which besides had the claws
of a tiger bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the
dragon that is a good book that you are reading mother plutarque
there is no more beautiful legend in existence
and m mabeuf fell into a delicious revery
chapter v poverty a good neighbor for misery
marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into
the clutches of indigence and who came to feel astonishment little
by little without however being made melancholy by it marius met
courfeyrac and sought out m mabeuf very rarely however twice a month
marius pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer
boulevards or in the champs de mars or in the least frequented alleys
of the luxembourg he often spent half a day in gazing at a market
garden the beds of lettuce the chickens on the dung heap the horse
turning the water wheel the passers by stared at him in surprise and
some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister he was
only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way
it was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the gorbeau house
and tempted by its isolation and its cheapness had taken up his abode
there he was known there only under the name of m marius
some of his fathers old generals or old comrades had invited him to go
and see them when they learned about him marius had not refused their
invitations they afforded opportunities of talking about his father
thus he went from time to time to comte pajol to general bellavesne
to general fririon to the invalides there was music and dancing there
on such evenings marius put on his new coat but he never went to
these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold
because he could not afford a carriage and he did not wish to arrive
he said sometimes but without bitterness men are so made that in a
drawing room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes in order
to insure a good reception there only one irreproachable thing is asked
all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery marius
political fevers vanished thus the revolution of 1830 assisted in the
process by satisfying and calming him he remained the same setting
aside his fits of wrath he still held the same opinions only they had
been tempered to speak accurately he had no longer any opinions he
had sympathies to what party did he belong to the party of humanity
out of humanity he chose france out of the nation he chose the people
out of the people he chose the woman it was to that point above all
that his pity was directed now he preferred an idea to a deed a
poet to a hero and he admired a book like job more than an event like
marengo and then when after a day spent in meditation he returned
in the evening through the boulevards and caught a glimpse through
the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond the nameless
gleams the abyss the shadow the mystery all that which is only human
he thought that he had and he really had in fact arrived at the truth
of life and of human philosophy and he had ended by gazing at nothing
but heaven the only thing which truth can perceive from the bottom of
this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans his combinations
his scaffoldings his projects for the future in this state of revery
an eye which could have cast a glance into marius interior would have
been dazzled with the purity of that soul in fact had it been given to
our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others we should
be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams
than according to what he thinks there is will in thought there is
none in dreams revery which is utterly spontaneous takes and keeps
even in the gigantic and the ideal the form of our spirit nothing
proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our
soul than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards
