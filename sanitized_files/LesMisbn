feudalism born from toil itself a false and dangerous situation which
sates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state
in the sufferings of the individual a badly constituted grandeur in
which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral
communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem
they are mistaken their division kills production equal partition
abolishes emulation and consequently labor it is a partition made
by the butcher which kills that which it divides it is therefore
impossible to pause over these pretended solutions slaying wealth is
the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved the
two problems must be combined and made but one
solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will
be england you will have like venice an artificial power or like
england a material power you will be the wicked rich man you will die
by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england
will fall and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely
selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a
it is well understood here that by the words venice england we
designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies
superposed on nations and not the nations themselves the nations
always have our respect and our sympathy venice as a people will live
again england the aristocracy will fall but england the nation is
solve the two problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor
suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by
the strong put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who
is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust
mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and
compulsory education with the growth of childhood and make of science
the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms busy be at one
and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render
property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal
so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier
matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce
wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and
material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france
this is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have
gone astray that is what it sought in facts that is what it sketched
these doctrines these theories these resistances the unforeseen
necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account confused
evidences of which we catch a glimpse a new system of politics to be
created which shall be in accord with the old world without too much
disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal a situation in which it
became necessary to use lafayette to defend polignac the intuition of
progress transparent beneath the revolt the chambers and streets the
competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him his faith in
the revolution perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the
vague acceptance of a superior definitive right his desire to remain of
his race his domestic spirit his sincere respect for the people his
own honesty preoccupied louis philippe almost painfully and there were
moments when strong and courageous as he was he was overwhelmed by the
he felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation which was not
nevertheless a reduction to dust france being more france than ever
piles of shadows covered the horizon a strange shade gradually drawing
nearer extended little by little over men over things over ideas
a shade which came from wraths and systems everything which had been
hastily stifled was moving and fermenting at times the conscience of
the honest man resumed its breathing so great was the discomfort
of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths spirits
trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm
the electric tension was such that at certain instants the first comer
a stranger brought light then the twilight obscurity closed in again
at intervals deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed
as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud
twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july the year
1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening
the distress of the people the laborers without bread the last prince

suspected ally ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to
hurl herself on that which should fall the peerage sheltering itself
behind beccaria to refuse four heads to the law the fleurs de lys

chapter v facts whence history springs and which history ignores
towards the end of april everything had become aggravated the
fermentation entered the boiling state ever since 1830 petty partial
revolts had been going on here and there which were quickly suppressed
but ever bursting forth afresh the sign of a vast underlying
conflagration something terrible was in preparation glimpses could be
caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted of a
possible revolution france kept an eye on paris paris kept an eye on
the faubourg saint antoine which was in a dull glow was beginning its
illustration a street orator 4b1 5 street orator
the wine shops of the rue de charonne were although the union of
the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine shops grave and
the government was there purely and simply called in question there
people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet
there were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they
would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm and that they
would fight without counting the number of the enemy this engagement
once entered into a man seated in the corner of the wine shop assumed
a sonorous tone and said you understand you have sworn
sometimes they went up stairs to a private room on the first floor
and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted they made the
initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the
in the tap rooms subversive pamphlets were read they treated the
government with contempt says a secret report of that time
words like the following could be heard there
i dont know the names of the leaders we folks shall not know the day
until two hours beforehand one workman said there are three hundred
of us let each contribute ten sous that will make one hundred and
fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot
another said i dont ask for six months i dont ask for even two
in less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government with
twenty five thousand men we can face them another said i dont sleep
at night because i make cartridges all night from time to time
men of bourgeois appearance and in good coats came and caused
embarrassment and with the air of command shook hands with the most
important and then went away they never stayed more than ten minutes
significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone the plot is ripe the
matter is arranged it was murmured by all who were there to borrow
the very expression of one of those who were present the exaltation was
such that one day a workingman exclaimed before the whole wine shop
we have no arms one of his comrades replied the soldiers have
thus parodying without being aware of the fact bonapartes proclamation
to the army in italy when they had anything of a more secret nature on
hand adds one report they did not communicate it to each other it
is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said
these reunions were sometimes periodical at certain ones of them there
were never more than eight or ten persons present and they were always
the same in others any one entered who wished and the room was
so full that they were forced to stand some went thither through
enthusiasm and passion others because it was on their way to their
work as during the revolution there were patriotic women in some of
a man would enter a shop drink and go his way with the remark
wine merchant the revolution will pay what is due to you
revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine shop facing the rue de
charonne the balloting was carried on in their caps
workingmen met at the house of a fencing master who gave lessons in
the rue de cotte there there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden
broadswords canes clubs and foils one day the buttons were removed
a workman said there are twenty five of us but they dont count
on me because i am looked upon as a machine later on that machine
the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange
and indescribable notoriety a woman sweeping off her doorsteps said
to another woman for a long time there has been a strong force busy
making cartridges in the open street proclamation could be seen
addressed to the national guard in the departments one of these
one day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an italian
accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor seller in the marche
lenoir and read aloud a singular document which seemed to emanate from
an occult power groups formed around him and applauded
the passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and
noted down  our doctrines are trammelled our proclamations torn our
bill stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison the breakdown
which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many
mediums the future of nations is being worked out in our obscure
ranks here are the fixed terms action or reaction revolution or
counter revolution for at our epoch we no longer believe either in
inertia or in immobility for the people against the people that is the
question there is no other on the day when we cease to suit you
break us but up to that day help us to march on all this in broad
other deeds more audacious still were suspicious in the eyes of the
people by reason of their very audacity on the 4th of april 1832 a
passer by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the
rue sainte marguerite and shouted i am a babouvist but beneath
down with property the opposition of the left is cowardly and
treacherous when it wants to be on the right side it preaches
revolution it is democratic in order to escape being beaten and
royalist so that it may not have to fight the republicans are beasts
with feathers distrust the republicans citizens of the laboring
this shout put an end to the discourse
at nightfall a workingman encountered near the canal a very well
dressed man who said to him whither are you bound citizen sir
replied the workingman i have not the honor of your acquaintance i
know you very well however and the man added dont be alarmed i
am an agent of the committee you are suspected of not being quite
faithful you know that if you reveal anything there is an eye fixed on
you then he shook hands with the workingman and went away saying we
the police who were on the alert collected singular dialogues not
only in the wine shops but in the street
get yourself received very soon said a weaver to a cabinet maker
there is going to be a shot to fire
two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies fraught with
the reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word jacquerie in a
on another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they
passed by we have a good plan of attack
only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men
who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the barriere du trone
everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about paris any
the principal leaders as they said in the faubourg held themselves
apart it was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine shop
near the point saint eustache a certain aug  chief of the society
aid for tailors rue mondetour had the reputation of serving as
intermediary central between the leaders and the faubourg saint antoine
nevertheless there was always a great deal of mystery about these
leaders and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of
this reply made later on by a man accused before the court of peers
i knew of none and i recognized none
there was nothing but words transparent but vague sometimes idle
a carpenter occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground
on which a house was in process of construction in the rue de reuilly
found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still
the committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections
we have learned that there are guns in the rue du faubourg poissonniere
no 5 bis to the number of five or six thousand in the house of a
gunsmith in that court the section owns no arms
what excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his
neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another
paper torn like the first and still more significant of which we
reproduce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to
 q  c  d  e  learn this list by heart after so doing
      you will tear it up the men admitted
      will do the same when you have transmitted
it was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this
find at the time learned the significance of those four capital
the sense of the letters u og a fe which was a date and meant april
15th 1832 under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by
very characteristic notes thus q bannerel 8 guns 83 cartridges a
safe man c boubiere 1 pistol 40 cartridges d rollet 1 foil
1 pistol 1 pound of powder e tessier 1 sword 1 cartridge box
finally this carpenter found still in the same enclosure a third
paper on which was written in pencil but very legibly this sort of
the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its
significance it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of
the sections of the fourth arondissement of the society of the rights
of man with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections to day
when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history
we may publish them it should be added that the foundation of the
society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date
when this paper was found perhaps this was only a rough draft
still according to all the remarks and the words according to written
notes material facts begin to make their appearance
in the rue popincourt in the house of a dealer in bric abrac there
were seized seven sheets of gray paper all folded alike lengthwise
and in four these sheets enclosed twenty six squares of this same
gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge and a card on which was
the report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell
a mason returning from his days work left behind him a little package
on a bench near the bridge of austerlitz this package was taken to
the police station it was opened and in it were found two printed
dialogues signed lahautiere a song entitled workmen band together
one artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how
warm he was the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat
in a ditch on the boulevard between pere lachaise and the barriere
du trone at the most deserted spot some children while playing
discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood a
bag containing a bullet mould a wooden punch for the preparation of
cartridges a wooden bowl in which there were grains of hunting powder
and a little cast iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of
police agents making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five
oclock in the morning into the dwelling of a certain pardon who
was afterwards a member of the barricade merry section and got himself
killed in the insurrection of april 1834 found him standing near his
bed and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of
towards the hour when workingmen repose two men were seen to meet
between the barriere picpus and the barriere charenton in a little lane
between two walls near a wine shop in front of which there was a jeu
de siam33 one drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to
the other as he was handing it to him he noticed that the perspiration
of his chest had made the powder damp he primed the pistol and added
more powder to what was already in the pan then the two men parted
a certain gallais afterwards killed in the rue beaubourg in the affair
of april boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and
the government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred
thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg on
the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed the
remarkable point about it was that the police were not able to seize a
an intercepted letter read the day is not far distant when within
four hours by the clock eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
all this fermentation was public one might almost say tranquil the
approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of
the government no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean
crisis which was already perceptible the bourgeois talked peaceably to
the working classes of what was in preparation they said how is the
rising coming along in the same tone in which they would have said
a furniture dealer of the rue moreau inquired well when are you
i know it a month ago there were fifteen thousand of you now there
are twenty five thousand he offered his gun and a neighbor offered a
small pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs
moreover the revolutionary fever was growing not a point in paris nor
in france was exempt from it the artery was beating everywhere like
those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the
human body the network of secret societies began to spread all over the
country from the associations of the friends of the people which was
at the same time public and secret sprang the society of the rights of
man which also dated from one of the orders of the day pluviose year
40 of the republican era which was destined to survive even the mandate
of the court of assizes which pronounced its dissolution and which
did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the
the society of the rights of man engendered the society of action these
were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead other
associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother
societies the members of sections complained that they were torn
asunder thus the gallic society and the committee of organization of
the municipalities thus the associations for the liberty of the press
for individual liberty for the instruction of the people against
indirect taxes then the society of equal workingmen which was divided
into three fractions the levellers the communists the reformers
then the army of the bastilles a sort of cohort organized on a military
footing four men commanded by a corporal ten by a sergeant twenty by
a sub lieutenant forty by a lieutenant there were never more than
five men who knew each other creation where precaution is combined with
audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of venice
the central committee which was at the head had two arms the society
of action and the army of the bastilles
a legitimist association the chevaliers of fidelity stirred about
among these the republican affiliations it was denounced and repudiated
the parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities lyons
nantes lille marseilles and each had its society of the rights of
man the charbonniere and the free men all had a revolutionary society
which was called the cougourde we have already mentioned this word
in paris the faubourg saint marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the
faubourg saint antoine and the schools were no less moved than the
faubourgs a cafe in the rue saint hyacinthe and the wine shop of the
seven billiards rue des mathurins saint jacques served as rallying
points for the students the society of the friends of the a b c
affiliated to the mutualists of angers and to the cougourde of aix
met as we have seen in the cafe musain these same young men assembled
also as we have stated already in a restaurant wine shop of the rue
mondetour which was called corinthe these meetings were secret others
were as public as possible and the reader can judge of their boldness
from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the
ulterior prosecutions where was this meeting held in the rue de la
paix at whose house in the street what sections were there
only one which the manuel section who was its leader
i you are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of
attacking the government where did your instructions come from from
the army was mined at the same time as the population as was proved
subsequently by the operations of beford luneville and epinard they
counted on the fifty second regiment on the fifth on the eighth on
the thirty seventh and on the twentieth light cavalry in burgundy and
in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say a
the faubourg saint antoine more than any other group of the population
as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made
it felt that was the sore point this old faubourg peopled like
an ant hill laborious courageous and angry as a hive of bees was
quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult everything
was in a state of agitation there without any interruption however of
the regular work it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet
sombre physiognomy in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden
under attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds it is
particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is
the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it
received the counter shock of commercial crises of failures strikes
slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances in times
of revolution misery is both cause and effect the blow which it deals
rebounds upon it this population full of proud virtue capable to the
highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to
explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the
fall of a spark whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased
by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg
saint antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very
gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas
the wine shops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than
once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess
historical notoriety in troublous times people grow intoxicated there
more on words than on wine a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus
of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls the
cabarets of the faubourg saint antoine resemble those taverns of mont
aventine erected on the cave of the sibyl and communicating with
the profound and sacred breath taverns where the tables were almost
tripods and where was drunk what ennius calls the sibylline wine
the faubourg saint antoine is a reservoir of people revolutionary
agitations create fissures there through which trickles the popular
sovereignty this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any
other but even when led astray it remains great we may say of it as
in 93 according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil
according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm there leaped
forth from the faubourg saint antoine now savage legions now heroic
savage let us explain this word when these bristling men who in the
early days of the revolutionary chaos tattered howling wild with
uplifted bludgeon pike on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in
an uproar what did they want they wanted an end to oppression an
end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the
child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity
bread for all the idea for all the edenizing of the world progress
and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible
wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in fist
a roar in their mouths they were savages yes but the savages of
they proclaimed right furiously they were desirous if only with
fear and trembling to force the human race to paradise they seemed
barbarians and they were saviours they demanded light with the mask of
facing these men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying but
ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling
embroidered gilded beribboned starred in silk stockings in white
plumes in yellow gloves in varnished shoes who with their elbows on
a velvet table beside a marble chimney piece insist gently on demeanor
and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right
of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war
glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and
the scaffold for our part if we were forced to make a choice between
the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we
but thank heaven still another choice is possible no perpendicular
fall is necessary in front any more than in the rear
neither despotism nor terrorism we desire progress with a gentle slope
god takes care of that gods whole policy consists in rendering slopes
it was about this epoch that enjolras in view of a possible
all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe musain
enjolras said mixing his words with a few half enigmatical but
it is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may
count if combatants are required they must be provided it can do no
harm to have something with which to strike passers by always have more
chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there
are none let us therefore reckon a little on the herd how many of us
are there there is no question of postponing this task until to morrow
revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose
let us mistrust the unexpected let us not be caught unprepared we must
go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast
this business ought to be concluded to day courfeyrac you will see the
polytechnic students it is their day to go out to day is wednesday
feuilly you will see those of the glaciere will you not combeferre
has promised me to go to picpus there is a perfect swarm and an
excellent one there bahorel will visit the estrapade prouvaire the
masons are growing lukewarm you will bring us news from the lodge of
the rue de grenelle saint honore joly will go to dupuytrens clinical
lecture and feel the pulse of the medical school bossuet will take a
little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates i will
enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection then he
at the barriere du maine there are marble workers painters and
journeymen in the studios of sculptors they are an enthusiastic family
but liable to cool off i dont know what has been the matter with
them for some time past they are thinking of something else they are
becoming extinguished they pass their time playing dominoes there is
urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little but
with firmness they meet at richefeus they are to be found there
between twelve and one oclock those ashes must be fanned into a glow
for that errand i had counted on that abstracted marius who is a good
fellow on the whole but he no longer comes to us i need some one for
the barriere du maine i have no one
what about me said grantaire here am i
you indoctrinate republicans you warm up hearts that have grown cold
i have a vague ambition in that direction said grantaire
well dont meddle with our affairs sleep yourself sober from your
you the man to go to the barriere du maine you capable of it
i am capable of descending the rue de gres of crossing the place
saint michel of sloping through the rue monsieur le prince of taking
the rue de vaugirard of passing the carmelites of turning into the rue
dassas of reaching the rue du cherche midi of leaving behind me the
conseil de guerre of pacing the rue des vielles tuileries of striding
across the boulevard of following the chaussee du maine of passing
the barrier and entering richefeus i am capable of that my shoes are
do you know anything of those comrades who meet at richefeus
not much we only address each other as thou
i will speak to them of robespierre pardi of danton of principles
i but i dont receive justice when i set about it i am terrible i
have read prudhomme i know the social contract i know my constitution
of the year two by heart the liberty of one citizen ends where the
liberty of another citizen begins do you take me for a brute i have
an old bank bill of the republic in my drawer the rights of man the
sovereignty of the people sapristi i am even a bit of a hebertist i
can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock watch in
enjolras meditated for a few moments and made the gesture of a man who
grantaire he said gravely i consent to try you you shall go to the
grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the cafe musain he went
out and five minutes later he returned he had gone home to put on a
red said he as he entered and he looked intently at enjolras then
with the palm of his energetic hand he laid the two scarlet points of
and stepping up to enjolras he whispered in his ear
he jammed his hat on resolutely and departed
a quarter of an hour later the back room of the cafe musain was
deserted all the friends of the a b c were gone each in his own
direction each to his own task enjolras who had reserved the
cougourde of aix for himself was the last to leave
those members of the cougourde of aix who were in paris then met on the
plain of issy in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in
as enjolras walked towards this place he passed the whole situation
in review in his own mind the gravity of events was self evident when
facts the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady move heavily
the slightest complication stops and entangles them a phenomenon whence
arises ruin and new births enjolras descried a luminous uplifting
beneath the gloomy skirts of the future who knows perhaps the moment
was at hand the people were again taking possession of right and
what a fine spectacle the revolution was again majestically taking
possession of france and saying to the world the sequel to morrow
enjolras was content the furnace was being heated he had at that
moment a powder train of friends scattered all over paris he composed
in his own mind with combeferres philosophical and penetrating
bahorels smile jean prouvaires melancholy jolys science bossuets
sarcasms a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at
once all hands to work surely the result would answer to the effort
this was well this made him think of grantaire
hold said he to himself the barriere du maine will not take me far
out of my way what if i were to go on as far as richefeus let us have
a look at what grantaire is about and see how he is getting on
one oclock was striking from the vaugirard steeple when enjolras
he pushed open the door entered folded his arms letting the door fall
to and strike his shoulders and gazed at that room filled with tables
a voice broke forth from the mist of smoke interrupted by another
voice it was grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary
grantaire was sitting opposite another figure at a marble saint anne
table strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos he was
hammering the table with his fist and this is what enjolras heard
that makes me twenty two thoughtfully twenty two
you werent expecting that double six if i had placed it at the
beginning the whole play would have been changed
what luck he has ah you are lucky long revery two
neither five nor one thats bad for you
marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose
track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building
bearing off his prisoners in three hackney coaches than marius also
glided out of the house it was only nine oclock in the evening marius
betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable
inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la
verrerie for political reasons this quarter was one where at that
epoch insurrection liked to install itself marius said to courfeyrac
i have come to sleep with you courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his
bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said
at seven oclock on the following morning marius returned to the hovel
paid the quarters rent which he owed to maam bougon had his books
his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a
hand cart and went off without leaving his address so that when javert
returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning
marius as to the events of the preceding evening he found only maam
maam bougon was convinced that marius was to some extent an accomplice
of the robbers who had been seized the night before who would ever
have said it she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter a young
man like that who had the air of a girl
marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence the first
was that he now had a horror of that house where he had beheld so
close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development
a social deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked
rich man the wicked poor man the second was that he did not wish
to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability and be
javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was
afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time
of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without
a month passed then another marius was still with courfeyrac he had
learned from a young licentiate in law an habitual frequenter of the
courts that thenardier was in close confinement every monday
marius had five francs handed in to the clerks office of la force for
as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five francs from
courfeyrac it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed
money these periodical five francs were a double riddle to courfeyrac
who lent and to thenardier who received them to whom can they go
thought courfeyrac whence can this come to me thenardier asked
moreover marius was heart broken everything had plunged through a
trap door once more he no longer saw anything before him his life
was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly he had for a
moment beheld very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom
he loved the old man who seemed to be her father those unknown beings
who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the
very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them a
gust had swept all these shadows away not a spark of certainty and
truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions no
conjecture was possible he no longer knew even the name that he thought
he knew it certainly was not ursule and the lark was a nickname and
what was he to think of the old man was he actually in hiding from
the police the white haired workman whom marius had encountered in the
vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind it now seemed probable
that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person so he
disguised himself that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides why
had he not called for help why had he fled was he or was he not
the father of the young girl was he in short the man whom thenardier
thought that he recognized thenardier might have been mistaken these
formed so many insoluble problems all this it is true detracted
nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg
heart rending distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night
over his eyes he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not
stir all had vanished save love of love itself he had lost the
instincts and the sudden illuminations ordinarily this flame which
burns us lights us also a little and casts some useful gleams without
but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion he never
said to himself what if i were to go to such a place what if i were
to try such and such a thing the girl whom he could no longer call
ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction
he should seek her his whole life was now summed up in two words
absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog to see her once again
he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it
to crown all his poverty had returned he felt that icy breath close to
him on his heels in the midst of his torments and long before
this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than
discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes a habit which is easy
to get rid of and difficult to take up again
a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic in discreet doses
it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes
severe and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects
the over harsh contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there
binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas but too much
dreaming sinks and drowns woe to the brain worker who allows himself to
fall entirely from thought into revery he thinks that he can re ascend
with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same
thought is the toil of the intelligence revery its voluptuousness to
replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food
marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember passion had
supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras
without object or bottom one no longer emerges from ones self except
for the purpose of going off to dream idle production tumultuous and
stagnant gulf and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase
this is a law man in a state of revery is generally prodigal and
slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds
there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for if
enervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful but the poor
man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost resources
fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as
the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two
by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to
excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras
marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes
fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw what we have just written seems
strange and yet it is true the memory of an absent being kindles in
the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it
beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon
