him then after all this suppose the day and hour for taking his degree
in his calling to have come suppose the day of battle to have arrived
when they invest him with the doctors cap made of lint to mend some
bullet hole perhaps that has gone through his temples or left him with
a crippled arm or leg or if this does not happen and merciful heaven
watches over him and keeps him safe and sound it may be he will be in
the same poverty he was in before and he must go through more
engagements and more battles and come victorious out of all before he
betters himself but miracles of that sort are seldom seen for tell me
sirs if you have ever reflected upon it by how much do those who have
gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it
no doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison that the dead
cannot be numbered while the living who have been rewarded may be summed
up with three figures all which is the reverse in the case of men of
letters for by skirts to say nothing of sleeves they all find means of
support so that though the soldier has more to endure his reward is
much less but against all this it may be urged that it is easier to
reward two thousand soldiers for the former may be remunerated by giving
them places which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling
while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the
master they serve but this impossibility only strengthens my argument
putting this however aside for it is a puzzling question for which it
is difficult to find a solution let us return to the superiority of arms
over letters a matter still undecided so many are the arguments put
forward on each side for besides those i have mentioned letters say
that without them arms cannot maintain themselves for war too has its
laws and is governed by them and laws belong to the domain of letters
and men of letters to this arms make answer that without them laws
cannot be maintained for by arms states are defended kingdoms
preserved cities protected roads made safe seas cleared of pirates
and in short if it were not for them states kingdoms monarchies
cities ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and
confusion which war brings with it so long as it lasts and is free to
make use of its privileges and powers and then it is plain that whatever
costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most to attain to
eminence in letters costs a man time watching hunger nakedness
headaches indigestions and other things of the sort some of which i
have already referred to but for a man to come in the ordinary course of
things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers and in an
incomparably higher degree for at every step he runs the risk of losing
his life for what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the
student can compare with what the soldier feels who finds himself
beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or
cavalier knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where
he is stationed and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from
the imminent danger that threatens him all he can do is to inform his
captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a
counter mine and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the
moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into
the deep against his will and if this seems a trifling risk let us see
whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem
to stem in the midst of the open sea locked and entangled one with the
other when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the
plank of the spur and yet though he sees before him threatening him as
many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him
not a lance length from his body and sees too that with the first
heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of neptunes
bosom still with dauntless heart urged on by honour that nerves him he
makes himself a target for all that musketry and struggles to cross that
narrow path to the enemys ship and what is still more marvellous no
sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the
end of the world than another takes his place and if he too falls into
the sea that waits for him like an enemy another and another will
succeed him without a moments pause between their deaths courage and
daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show happy the blest
ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery
whose inventor i am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his
diabolical invention by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly
arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman and that when he knows not
how or whence in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and
animate brave hearts there should come some random bullet discharged
perhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his
accursed machine which in an instant puts an end to the projects and
cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come and thus
when i reflect on this i am almost tempted to say that in my heart i
repent of having adopted this profession of knight errant in so
detestable an age as we live in now for though no peril can make me
fear still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may
rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout
the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword but
heavens will be done if i succeed in my attempt i shall be all the more
honoured as i have faced greater dangers than the knights errant of yore
all this lengthy discourse don quixote delivered while the others supped
forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips though sancho more than once
told him to eat his supper as he would have time enough afterwards to
say all he wanted it excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to
see a man of apparently sound sense and with rational views on every
subject he discussed so hopelessly wanting in all when his wretched
unlucky chivalry was in question the curate told him he was quite right
in all he had said in favour of arms and that he himself though a man
of letters and a graduate was of the same opinion
they finished their supper the cloth was removed and while the hostess
her daughter and maritornes were getting don quixote of la manchas
garret ready in which it was arranged that the women were to be
quartered by themselves for the night don fernando begged the captive to
tell them the story of his life for it could not fail to be strange and
interesting to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in
company with zoraida to this the captive replied that he would very
willingly yield to his request only he feared his tale would not give
them as much pleasure as he wished nevertheless not to be wanting in
compliance he would tell it the curate and the others thanked him and
added their entreaties and he finding himself so pressed said there was
no occasion ask where a command had such weight and added if your
worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which
perhaps fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art
cannot come up to these words made them settle themselves in their
places and preserve a deep silence and he seeing them waiting on his
words in mute expectation began thus in a pleasant quiet voice
wherein the captive relates his life and adventures
my family had its origin in a village in the mountains of leon and
nature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune though in
the general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even
a rich man and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever in
preserving his property as he was in spending it this tendency of his to
be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his
youth for the soldiers life is a school in which the niggard becomes
free handed and the free handed prodigal and if any soldiers are to be
found who are misers they are monsters of rare occurrence my father
went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality a disposition by no
means advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his
name and position my father had three all sons and all of sufficient
age to make choice of a profession finding then that he was unable to
resist his propensity he resolved to divest himself of the instrument
and cause of his prodigality and lavishness to divest himself of wealth
without which alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious and so
calling us all three aside one day into a room he addressed us in words
my sons to assure you that i love you no more need be known or said
than that you are my sons and to encourage a suspicion that i do not
love you no more is needed than the knowledge that i have no
self control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned
therefore that you may for the future feel sure that i love you like a
father and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather i propose to do
with you what i have for some time back meditated and after mature
deliberation decided upon you are now of an age to choose your line of
life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and
profit when you are older and what i have resolved to do is to divide my
property into four parts three i will give to you to each his portion
without making any difference and the other i will retain to live upon
and support myself for whatever remainder of life heaven may be pleased
to grant me but i wish each of you on taking possession of the share
that falls to him to follow one of the paths i shall indicate in this
spain of ours there is a proverb to my mind very true as they all are
being short aphorisms drawn from long practical experience and the one i
refer to says the church or the sea or the kings house as much as
to say in plainer language whoever wants to flourish and become rich
let him follow the church or go to sea adopting commerce as his
calling or go into the kings service in his household for they say
better a kings crumb than a lords favour i say so because it is my
will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters another trade
and the third serve the king in the wars for it is a difficult matter to
gain admission to his service in his household and if war does not bring
much wealth it confers great distinction and fame eight days hence i
will give you your full shares in money without defrauding you of a
farthing as you will see in the end now tell me if you are willing to
follow out my idea and advice as i have laid it before you
having called upon me as the eldest to answer i after urging him not to
strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased for we
were young men able to gain our living consented to comply with his
wishes and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and
thereby serve god and my king my second brother having made the same
proposal decided upon going to the indies embarking the portion that
fell to him in trade the youngest and in my opinion the wisest said he
would rather follow the church or go to complete his studies at
salamanca as soon as we had come to an understanding and made choice of
our professions my father embraced us all and in the short time he
mentioned carried into effect all he had promised and when he had given
to each his share which as well as i remember was three thousand ducats
apiece in cash for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it
down not to let it go out of the family we all three on the same day
took leave of our good father and at the same time as it seemed to me
inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age i
induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats as the remainder
would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed my two brothers
moved by my example gave him each a thousand ducats so that there was
left for my father four thousand ducats in money besides three thousand
the value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain in
land instead of selling it finally as i said we took leave of him and
of our uncle whom i have mentioned not without sorrow and tears on both
sides they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offered
how we fared whether well or ill we promised to do so and when he had
embraced us and given us his blessing one set out for salamanca the
other for seville and i for alicante where i had heard there was a
genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for genoa
it is now some twenty two years since i left my fathers house and all
that time though i have written several letters i have had no news
whatever of him or of my brothers my own adventures during that period i
will now relate briefly i embarked at alicante reached genoa after a
prosperous voyage and proceeded thence to milan where i provided myself
with arms and a few soldiers accoutrements thence it was my intention
to go and take service in piedmont but as i was already on the road to
alessandria della paglia i learned that the great duke of alva was on
his way to flanders i changed my plans joined him served under him in
the campaigns he made was present at the deaths of the counts egmont and
horn and was promoted to be ensign under a famous captain of
guadalajara diego de urbina by name some time after my arrival in
flanders news came of the league that his holiness pope pius v of happy
memory had made with venice and spain against the common enemy the
turk who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island of cyprus
which belonged to the venetians a loss deplorable and disastrous it was
known as a fact that the most serene don john of austria natural brother
of our good king don philip was coming as commander in chief of the
allied forces and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations
which were being made all which stirred my heart and filled me with a
longing to take part in the campaign which was expected and though i had
reason to believe and almost certain promises that on the first
opportunity that presented itself i should be promoted to be captain i
preferred to leave all and betake myself as i did to italy and it was
my good fortune that don john had just arrived at genoa and was going on
to naples to join the venetian fleet as he afterwards did at messina i
may say in short that i took part in that glorious expedition promoted
by this time to be a captain of infantry to which honourable charge my
good luck rather than my merits raised me and that day so fortunate for
christendom because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of
the error under which they lay in imagining the turks to be invincible on
sea on that day i say on which the ottoman pride and arrogance were
broken among all that were there made happy for the christians who died
that day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious i
alone was miserable for instead of some naval crown that i might have
expected had it been in roman times on the night that followed that
famous day i found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my
it happened in this way el uchali the king of algiers a daring and
successful corsair having attacked and taken the leading maltese galley
only three knights being left alive in it and they badly wounded the
chief galley of john andrea on board of which i and my company were
placed came to its relief and doing as was bound to do in such a case
i leaped on board the enemys galley which sheering off from that which
had attacked it prevented my men from following me and so i found
myself alone in the midst of my enemies who were in such numbers that i
was unable to resist in short i was taken covered with wounds el
uchali as you know sirs made his escape with his entire squadron and
i was left a prisoner in his power the only sad being among so many
filled with joy and the only captive among so many free for there were
fifteen thousand christians all at the oar in the turkish fleet that
they carried me to constantinople where the grand turk selim made my
master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried
off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the order of malta the
following year which was the year seventy two i found myself at
navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns there i
saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole turkish fleet
in harbour was lost for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to
it made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour
and had their kits and pasamaques or shoes ready to flee at once on
shore without waiting to be assailed in so great fear did they stand of
our fleet but heaven ordered it otherwise not for any fault or neglect
of the general who commanded on our side but for the sins of
christendom and because it was gods will and pleasure that we should
always have instruments of punishment to chastise us as it was el
uchali took refuge at modon which is an island near navarino and
landing forces fortified the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly
until don john retired on this expedition was taken the galley called
the prize whose captain was a son of the famous corsair barbarossa it
was taken by the chief neapolitan galley called the she wolf commanded
by that thunderbolt of war that father of his men that successful and
unconquered captain don alvaro de bazan marquis of santa cruz and i
cannot help telling you what took place at the capture of the prize
the son of barbarossa was so cruel and treated his slaves so badly
that when those who were at the oars saw that the she wolf galley was
bearing down upon them and gaining upon them they all at once dropped
their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of
the gangway shouting to them to row lustily and passing him on from
bench to bench from the poop to the prow they so bit him that before he
had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell so great as
i said was the cruelty with which he treated them and the hatred with
we returned to constantinople and the following year seventy three it
became known that don john had seized tunis and taken the kingdom from
the turks and placed muley hamet in possession putting an end to the
hopes which muley hamida the cruelest and bravest moor in the world
entertained of returning to reign there the grand turk took the loss
greatly to heart and with the cunning which all his race possess he
made peace with the venetians who were much more eager for it than he
was and the following year seventy four he attacked the goletta and
the fort which don john had left half built near tunis while all these
events were occurring i was labouring at the oar without any hope of
freedom at least i had no hope of obtaining it by ransom for i was
firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes
at length the goletta fell and the fort fell before which places there
were seventy five thousand regular turkish soldiers and more than four
hundred thousand moors and arabs from all parts of africa and in the
train of all this great host such munitions and engines of war and so
many pioneers that with their hands they might have covered the goletta
and the fort with handfuls of earth the first to fall was the goletta
until then reckoned impregnable and it fell not by any fault of its
defenders who did all that they could and should have done but because
experiment proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert
sand there for water used to be found at two palms depth while the
turks found none at two yards and so by means of a quantity of sandbags
they raised their works so high that they commanded the walls of the
fort sweeping them as if from a cavalier so that no one was able to
it was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up
in the goletta but should have waited in the open at the landing place
but those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such
matters for if in the goletta and in the fort there were barely seven
thousand soldiers how could such a small number however resolute sally
out and hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy and how
is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved above
all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country
but many thought and i thought so too that it was special favour and
mercy which heaven showed to spain in permitting the destruction of that
source and hiding place of mischief that devourer sponge and moth of
countless money fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save
preserving the memory of its capture by the invincible charles v as if
to make that eternal as it is and will be these stones were needed to
support it the fort also fell but the turks had to win it inch by inch
for the soldiers who defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the
number of the enemy killed in twenty two general assaults exceeded
twenty five thousand of three hundred that remained alive not one was
taken unwounded a clear and manifest proof of their gallantry and
resolution and how sturdily they had defended themselves and held their
post a small fort or tower which was in the middle of the lagoon under
the command of don juan zanoguera a valencian gentleman and a famous
soldier capitulated upon terms they took prisoner don pedro
puertocarrero commandant of the goletta who had done all in his power
to defend his fortress and took the loss of it so much to heart that he
died of grief on the way to constantinople where they were carrying him
a prisoner they also took the commandant of the fort gabrio cerbellon
by name a milanese gentleman a great engineer and a very brave soldier
in these two fortresses perished many persons of note among whom was
pagano doria knight of the order of st john a man of generous
disposition as was shown by his extreme liberality to his brother the
famous john andrea doria and what made his death the more sad was that
he was slain by some arabs to whom seeing that the fort was now lost he
entrusted himself and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a
moor to tabarca a small fort or station on the coast held by the genoese
employed in the coral fishery these arabs cut off his head and carried
it to the commander of the turkish fleet who proved on them the truth of
our castilian proverb that though the treason may please the traitor
is hated for they say he ordered those who brought him the present to
be hanged for not having brought him alive
among the christians who were taken in the fort was one named don pedro
de aguilar a native of some place i know not what in andalusia who
had been ensign in the fort a soldier of great repute and rare
intelligence who had in particular a special gift for what they call
poetry i say so because his fate brought him to my galley and to my
bench and made him a slave to the same master and before we left the
port this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs one on the
goletta and the other on the fort indeed i may as well repeat them for
i have them by heart and i think they will be liked rather than
the instant the captive mentioned the name of don pedro de aguilar don
fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled and when he
came to speak of the sonnets one of them said before your worship
proceeds any further i entreat you to tell me what became of that don
all i know is replied the captive that after having been in
constantinople two years he escaped in the disguise of an arnaut in
company with a greek spy but whether he regained his liberty or not i
cannot tell though i fancy he did because a year afterwards i saw the
greek at constantinople though i was unable to ask him what the result
well then you are right returned the gentleman for that don pedro
is my brother and he is now in our village in good health rich
thanks be to god for all the mercies he has shown him said the
captive for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with
and what is more said the gentleman i know the sonnets my brother
then let your worship repeat them said the captive for you will
with all my heart said the gentleman that on the goletta runs thus
in which the story of the captive is continued
blest souls that from this mortal husk set free
your strength while strength was yours in battle plied
and with your own blood and the foemans dyed
it was the ebbing life blood first that failed
the weary arms the stout hearts never quailed
though vanquished yet ye earned the victors crown
though mourned yet still triumphant was your fall
for there ye won between the sword and wall
that is it exactly according to my recollection said the captive
well then that on the fort said the gentleman if my memory serves
up from this wasted soil this shattered shell
whose walls and towers here in ruin lie
three thousand soldier souls took wing on high
in the bright mansions of the blest to dwell
by might of arm all vainly did they try
and when at length twas left them but to die
and this same arid soil hath ever been
as well in our day as in days of yore
but never yet to heaven it sent i ween
from its hard bosom purer souls than these
the sonnets were not disliked and the captive was rejoiced at the
tidings they gave him of his comrade and continuing his tale he went on
the goletta and the fort being thus in their hands the turks gave orders
to dismantle the goletta for the fort was reduced to such a state that
there was nothing left to level and to do the work more quickly and
easily they mined it in three places but nowhere were they able to blow
up the part which seemed to be the least strong that is to say the old
walls while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that
the fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease finally
the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to constantinople and a few
months later died my master el uchali otherwise uchali fartax which
means in turkish the scabby renegade for that he was it is the
practice with the turks to name people from some defect or virtue they
may possess the reason being that there are among them only four
surnames belonging to families tracing their descent from the ottoman
house and the others as i have said take their names and surnames
either from bodily blemishes or moral qualities this scabby one rowed
at the oar as a slave of the grand signors for fourteen years and when
over thirty four years of age in resentment at having been struck by a
turk while at the oar turned renegade and renounced his faith in order
to be able to revenge himself and such was his valour that without
owing his advancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites
of the grand signor rise to power he came to be king of algiers and
afterwards general on sea which is the third place of trust in the
realm he was a calabrian by birth and a worthy man morally and he
treated his slaves with great humanity he had three thousand of them
and after his death they were divided as he directed by his will
between the grand signor who is heir of all who die and shares with the
children of the deceased and his renegades i fell to the lot of a
venetian renegade who when a cabin boy on board a ship had been taken
by uchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most
favoured youths he came to be the most cruel renegade i ever saw his
name was hassan aga and he grew very rich and became king of algiers
with him i went there from constantinople rather glad to be so near
spain not that i intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot but
to try if fortune would be kinder to me in algiers than in
constantinople where i had attempted in a thousand ways to escape
without ever finding a favourable time or chance but in algiers i
resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose i cherished so
dearly for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me and when
in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my
expectations without giving way to despair i immediately began to look
out for or conjure up some new hope to support me however faint or
in this way i lived on immured in a building or prison called by the
turks a bano in which they confine the christian captives as well those
that are the kings as those belonging to private individuals and also
what they call those of the almacen which is as much as to say the
slaves of the municipality who serve the city in the public works and
other employments but captives of this kind recover their liberty with
great difficulty for as they are public property and have no particular
master there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom even though
they may have the means to these banos as i have said some private
individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their captives
especially when they are to be ransomed because there they can keep them
in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives the kings captives
also that are on ransom do not go out to work with the rest of the
crew unless when their ransom is delayed for then to make them write
for it more pressingly they compel them to work and go for wood which
i however was one of those on ransom for when it was discovered that i
was a captain although i declared my scanty means and want of fortune
nothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen and
those waiting to be ransomed they put a chain on me more as a mark of
this than to keep me safe and so i passed my life in that bano with
several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to
ransom but though at times or rather almost always we suffered from
hunger and scanty clothing nothing distressed us so much as hearing and
seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard of cruelties my master
inflicted upon the christians every day he hanged a man impaled one
cut off the ears of another and all with so little provocation or so
entirely without any that the turks acknowledged he did it merely for
the sake of doing it and because he was by nature murderously disposed
towards the whole human race the only one that fared at all well with
him was a spanish soldier something de saavedra by name to whom he
never gave a blow himself or ordered a blow to be given or addressed a
hard word although he had done things that will dwell in the memory of
the people there for many a year and all to recover his liberty and for
the least of the many things he did we all dreaded that he would be
impaled and he himself was in fear of it more than once and only that
time does not allow i could tell you now something of what that soldier
did that would interest and astonish you much more than the narration of
to go on with my story the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by the
windows of the house belonging to a wealthy moor of high position and
these as is usual in moorish houses were rather loopholes than windows
and besides were covered with thick and close lattice work it so
happened then that as i was one day on the terrace of our prison with
three other comrades trying to pass away the time how far we could
leap with our chains we being alone for all the other christians had
gone out to work i chanced to raise my eyes and from one of these
little closed windows i saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the
end of it and it kept waving to and fro and moving as if making signs
to us to come and take it we watched it and one of those who were with
me went and stood under the reed to see whether they would let it drop
or what they would do but as he did so the reed was raised and moved
from side to side as if they meant to say no by a shake of the head
the christian came back and it was again lowered making the same
movements as before another of my comrades went and with him the same
happened as with the first and then the third went forward but with the
same result as the first and second seeing this i did not like not to
try my luck and as soon as i came under the reed it was dropped and fell
inside the bano at my feet i hastened to untie the cloth in which i
perceived a knot and in this were ten cianis which are coins of base
gold current among the moors and each worth ten reals of our money
it is needless to say i rejoiced over this godsend and my joy was not
less than my wonder as i strove to imagine how this good fortune could
have come to us but to me specially for the evident unwillingness to
drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was
intended i took my welcome money broke the reed and returned to the
terrace and looking up at the window i saw a very white hand put out
that opened and shut very quickly from this we gathered or fancied that
it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this
kindness and to show that we were grateful for it we made salaams after
the fashion of the moors bowing the head bending the body and crossing
the arms on the breast shortly afterwards at the same window a small
cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn this sign led
us to believe that some christian woman was a captive in the house and
that it was she who had been so good to us but the whiteness of the hand
and the bracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea though we
thought it might be one of the christian renegades whom their masters
very often take as lawful wives and gladly for they prefer them to the
women of their own nation in all our conjectures we were wide of the
truth so from that time forward our sole occupation was watching and
gazing at the window where the cross had appeared to us as if it were
our pole star but at least fifteen days passed without our seeing either
it or the hand or any other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured
with the utmost pains to ascertain who it was that lived in the house
and whether there were any christian renegade in it nobody could ever
tell us anything more than that he who lived there was a rich moor of
high position hadji morato by name formerly alcaide of la pata an
office of high dignity among them but when we least thought it was going
to rain any more cianis from that quarter we saw the reed suddenly
appear with another cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it and this
at a time when as on the former occasion the bano was deserted and
we made trial as before each of the same three going forward before i
did but the reed was delivered to none but me and on my approach it was
let drop i untied the knot and i found forty spanish gold crowns with a
paper written in arabic and at the end of the writing there was a large
cross drawn i kissed the cross took the crowns and returned to the
terrace and we all made our salaams again the hand appeared i made
signs that i would read the paper and then the window was closed we
were all puzzled though filled with joy at what had taken place and as
none of us understood arabic great was our curiosity to know what the
paper contained and still greater the difficulty of finding some one to
read it at last i resolved to confide in a renegade a native of murcia
who professed a very great friendship for me and had given pledges that
bound him to keep any secret i might entrust to him for it is the custom
with some renegades when they intend to return to christian territory
to carry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying in
whatever form they can that such and such a renegade is a worthy man who
has always shown kindness to christians and is anxious to escape on the
first opportunity that may present itself some obtain these testimonials
with good intentions others put them to a cunning use for when they go
to pillage on christian territory if they chance to be cast away or
taken prisoners they produce their certificates and say that from these
papers may be seen the object they came for which was to remain on
christian ground and that it was to this end they joined the turks in
their foray in this way they escape the consequences of the first
outburst and make their peace with the church before it does them any
harm and then when they have the chance they return to barbary to become
what they were before others however there are who procure these
papers and make use of them honestly and remain on christian soil this
friend of mine then was one of these renegades that i have described
he had certificates from all our comrades in which we testified in his
favour as strongly as we could and if the moors had found the papers
i knew that he understood arabic very well and could not only speak but
also write it but before i disclosed the whole matter to him i asked
him to read for me this paper which i had found by accident in a hole in
my cell he opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering
to himself as he translated it i asked him if he understood it and he
told me he did perfectly well and that if i wished him to tell me its
meaning word for word i must give him pen and ink that he might do it
more satisfactorily we at once gave him what he required and he set
about translating it bit by bit and when he had done he said
all that is here in spanish is what the moorish paper contains and you
must bear in mind that when it says lela marien it means our lady the
we read the paper and it ran thus
when i was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the
christian prayer in my own language and told me many things about lela
marien the christian died and i know that she did not go to the fire
but to allah because since then i have seen her twice and she told me
to go to the land of the christians to see lela marien who had great
love for me i know not how to go i have seen many christians but
except thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman i am young and
beautiful and have plenty of money to take with me see if thou canst
contrive how we may go and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there
and if thou wilt not it will not distress me for lela marien will find
me some one to marry me i myself have written this have a care to whom
thou givest it to read trust no moor for they are all perfidious i am
greatly troubled on this account for i would not have thee confide in
anyone because if my father knew it he would at once fling me down a
well and cover me with stones i will put a thread to the reed tie the
answer to it and if thou hast no one to write for thee in arabic tell
it to me by signs for lela marien will make me understand thee she and
allah and this cross which i often kiss as the captive bade me protect
judge sirs whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of
this paper and both one and the other were so great that the renegade
perceived that the paper had not been found by chance but had been in
reality addressed to some one of us and he begged us if what he
suspected were the truth to trust him and tell him all for he would
risk his life for our freedom and so saying he took out from his breast
a metal crucifix and with many tears swore by the god the image
represented in whom sinful and wicked as he was he truly and
faithfully believed to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose
to reveal to him for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her
who had written that paper he and all of us would obtain our liberty
and he himself obtain the object he so much desired his restoration to
the bosom of the holy mother church from which by his own sin and
ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb the renegade said this
with so many tears and such signs of repentance that with one consent we
all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the matter and so we gave him
a full account of all without hiding anything from him we pointed out
to him the window at which the reed appeared and he by that means took
note of the house and resolved to ascertain with particular care who
lived in it we agreed also that it would be advisable to answer the
moorish ladys letter and the renegade without a moments delay took
down the words i dictated to him which were exactly what i shall tell
you for nothing of importance that took place in this affair has escaped
my memory or ever will while life lasts this then was the answer
the true allah protect thee lady and that blessed marien who is the
true mother of god and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land
of the christians because she loves thee entreat her that she be
pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee
for she will such is her goodness on my own part and on that of all
these christians who are with me i promise to do all that we can for
thee even to death fail not to write to me and inform me what thou dost
mean to do and i will always answer thee for the great allah has given
us a christian captive who can speak and write thy language well as thou
mayest see by this paper without fear therefore thou canst inform us
of all thou wouldst as to what thou sayest that if thou dost reach the
land of the christians thou wilt be my wife i give thee my promise upon
it as a good christian and know that the christians keep their promises
better than the moors allah and marien his mother watch over thee my
the paper being written and folded i waited two days until the bano was
empty as before and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the
terrace to see if there were any sign of the reed which was not long in
making its appearance as soon as i saw it although i could not
distinguish who put it out i showed the paper as a sign to attach the
thread but it was already fixed to the reed and to it i tied the paper
and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the
white flag of peace the little bundle it was dropped and i picked it
up and found in the cloth in gold and silver coins of all sorts more
than fifty crowns which fifty times more strengthened our joy and
doubled our hope of gaining our liberty that very night our renegade
returned and said he had learned that the moor we had been told of lived
in that house that his name was hadji morato that he was enormously
rich that he had one only daughter the heiress of all his wealth and
that it was the general opinion throughout the city that she was the most
beautiful woman in barbary and that several of the viceroys who came
there had sought her for a wife but that she had been always unwilling
to marry and he had learned moreover that she had a christian slave
who was now dead all which agreed with the contents of the paper we
immediately took counsel with the renegade as to what means would have to
be adopted in order to carry off the moorish lady and bring us all to
christian territory and in the end it was agreed that for the present we
should wait for a second communication from zoraida for that was the
name of her who now desires to be called maria because we saw clearly
that she and no one else could find a way out of all these difficulties
when we had decided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy for
he would lose his life or restore us to liberty for four days the bano
was filled with people for which reason the reed delayed its appearance
for four days but at the end of that time when the bano was as it
generally was empty it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it
promised a happy birth reed and cloth came down to me and i found
another paper and a hundred crowns in gold without any other coin the
renegade was present and in our cell we gave him the paper to read
i cannot think of a plan senor for our going to spain nor has lela
marien shown me one though i have asked her all that can be done is for
me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window with it ransom
yourself and your friends and let one of you go to the land of the
christians and there buy a vessel and come back for the others and he
will find me in my fathers garden which is at the babazon gate near the
seashore where i shall be all this summer with my father and my
servants you can carry me away from there by night without any danger
and bring me to the vessel and remember thou art to be my husband else
i will pray to marien to punish thee if thou canst not trust anyone to
go for the vessel ransom thyself and do thou go for i know thou wilt
return more surely than any other as thou art a gentleman and a
christian endeavour to make thyself acquainted with the garden and when
i see thee walking yonder i shall know that the bano is empty and i will
give thee abundance of money allah protect thee senor
these were the words and contents of the second paper and on hearing
them each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one and promised
to go and return with scrupulous good faith and i too made the same
offer but to all this the renegade objected saying that he would not on
any account consent to one being set free before all went together as
experience had taught him how ill those who have been set free keep
promises which they made in captivity for captives of distinction
frequently had recourse to this plan paying the ransom of one who was to
go to valencia or majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark and
return for the others who had ransomed him but who never came back for
recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memory
all the obligations in the world and to prove the truth of what he said
he told us briefly what had happened to a certain christian gentleman
almost at that very time the strangest case that had ever occurred even
there where astonishing and marvellous things are happening every
instant in short he ended by saying that what could and ought to be
done was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us
christians to him so that he might with it buy a vessel there in algiers
under the pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at tetuan and along
the coast and when master of the vessel it would be easy for him to hit
on some way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board
especially if the moorish lady gave as she said money enough to ransom
all because once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us
to embark even in open day but the greatest difficulty was that the
moors do not allow any renegade to buy or own any craft unless it be a
large vessel for going on roving expeditions because they are afraid
that anyone who buys a small vessel especially if he be a spaniard only
wants it for the purpose of escaping to christian territory this however
he could get over by arranging with a tagarin moor to go shares with him
in the purchase of the vessel and in the profit on the cargo and under
cover of this he could become master of the vessel in which case he
looked upon all the rest as accomplished but though to me and my
comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to majorca for the vessel
as the moorish lady suggested we did not dare to oppose him fearing
that if we did not do as he said he would denounce us and place us in
danger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with
zoraida for whose life we would have all given our own we therefore
resolved to put ourselves in the hands of god and in the renegades and
at the same time an answer was given to zoraida telling her that we
would do all she recommended for she had given as good advice as if lela
marien had delivered it and that it depended on her alone whether we
were to defer the business or put it in execution at once i renewed my
promise to be her husband and thus the next day that the bano chanced to
be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed and cloth
two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that the next
juma that is to say friday she was going to her fathers garden but
that before she went she would give us more money and if it were not
enough we were to let her know as she would give us as much as we asked
for her father had so much he would not miss it and besides she kept all
we at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel and
with eight hundred i ransomed myself giving the money to a valencian
merchant who happened to be in algiers at the time and who had me
released on his word pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship
from valencia he would pay my ransom for if he had given the money at
once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been
for a long time in algiers and that the merchant had for his own
advantage kept it secret in fact my master was so difficult to deal with
that i dared not on any account pay down the money at once the thursday
before the friday on which the fair zoraida was to go to the garden she
gave us a thousand crowns more and warned us of her departure begging
me if i were ransomed to find out her fathers garden at once and by
all means to seek an opportunity of going there to see her i answered in
a few words that i would do so and that she must remember to commend us
to lela marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her this
having been done steps were taken to ransom our three comrades so as to
enable them to quit the bano and lest seeing me ransomed and themselves
not though the money was forthcoming they should make a disturbance
about it and the devil should prompt them to do something that might
injure zoraida for though their position might be sufficient to relieve
me from this apprehension nevertheless i was unwilling to run any risk
in the matter and so i had them ransomed in the same way as i was
handing over all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety
and confidence give security without however confiding our arrangement
and secret to him which might have been dangerous
in which the captive still continues his adventures
before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an
excellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons and to make the
transaction safe and lend a colour to it he thought it well to make as
he did a voyage to a place called shershel twenty leagues from algiers
on the oran side where there is an extensive trade in dried figs two or
three times he made this voyage in company with the tagarin already
mentioned the moors of aragon are called tagarins in barbary and those
of granada mudejars but in the kingdom of fez they call the mudejars
elches and they are the people the king chiefly employs in war to
proceed every time he passed with his vessel he anchored in a cove that
was not two crossbow shots from the garden where zoraida was waiting and
there the renegade together with the two moorish lads that rowed used
purposely to station himself either going through his prayers or else
practising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest and thus he
would go to zoraidas garden and ask for fruit which her father gave
him not knowing him but though as he afterwards told me he sought to
speak to zoraida and tell her who he was and that by my orders he was
to take her to the land of the christians so that she might feel
satisfied and easy he had never been able to do so for the moorish
women do not allow themselves to be seen by any moor or turk unless
their husband or father bid them with christian captives they permit
freedom of intercourse and communication even more than might be
considered proper but for my part i should have been sorry if he had
spoken to her for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find her affairs
talked of by renegades but god who ordered it otherwise afforded no
opportunity for our renegades well meant purpose and he seeing how
safely he could go to shershel and return and anchor when and how and
where he liked and that the tagarin his partner had no will but his and
that now i was ransomed all we wanted was to find some christians to
row told me to look out for any i should be willing to take with me
over and above those who had been ransomed and to engage them for the
next friday which he fixed upon for our departure on this i spoke to
twelve spaniards all stout rowers and such as could most easily leave
the city but it was no easy matter to find so many just then because
there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers
with them and these would not have been found were it not that their
master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to
finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks to these men i said nothing
more than that the next friday in the evening they were to come out
stealthily one by one and hang about hadji moratos garden waiting for
me there until i came these directions i gave each one separately with
orders that if they saw any other christians there they were not to say
anything to them except that i had directed them to wait at that spot
this preliminary having been settled another still more necessary step
had to be taken which was to let zoraida know how matters stood that she
might be prepared and forewarned so as not to be taken by surprise if we
were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the christians vessel
could have returned i determined therefore to go to the garden and try
if i could speak to her and the day before my departure i went there
under the pretence of gathering herbs the first person i met was her
father who addressed me in the language that all over barbary and even
in constantinople is the medium between captives and moors and is
neither morisco nor castilian nor of any other nation but a mixture of
all languages by means of which we can all understand one another in
this sort of language i say he asked me what i wanted in his garden
and to whom i belonged i replied that i was a slave of the arnaut mami
for i knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his and
that i wanted some herbs to make a salad he asked me then whether i were
on ransom or not and what my master demanded for me while these
questions and answers were proceeding the fair zoraida who had already
perceived me some time before came out of the house in the garden and
as moorish women are by no means particular about letting themselves be
seen by christians or as i have said before at all coy she had no
hesitation in coming to where her father stood with me moreover her
father seeing her approaching slowly called to her to come it would be
beyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty the high bred
air the brilliant attire of my beloved zoraida as she presented herself
before my eyes i will content myself with saying that more pearls hung
from her fair neck her ears and her hair than she had hairs on her
head on her ankles which as is customary were bare she had carcajes
for so bracelets or anklets are called in morisco of the purest gold
set with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued
them at ten thousand doubloons and those she had on her wrists were
worth as much more the pearls were in profusion and very fine for the
highest display and adornment of the moorish women is decking themselves
with rich pearls and seed pearls and of these there are therefore more
among the moors than among any other people zoraidas father had to the
reputation of possessing a great number and the purest in all algiers
and of possessing also more than two hundred thousand spanish crowns and
she who is now mistress of me only was mistress of all this whether
thus adorned she would have been beautiful or not and what she must have
been in her prosperity may be imagined from the beauty remaining to her
after so many hardships for as everyone knows the beauty of some women
has its times and its seasons and is increased or diminished by chance
causes and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair
it though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it in a word she
presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour
and supremely beautiful at any rate she seemed to me the most beautiful
object i had ever seen and when besides i thought of all i owed to her
i felt as though i had before me some heavenly being come to earth to
as she approached her father told her in his own language that i was a
captive belonging to his friend the arnaut mami and that i had come for
she took up the conversation and in that mixture of tongues i have
spoken of she asked me if i was a gentleman and why i was not ransomed
i answered that i was already ransomed and that by the price it might be
seen what value my master set on me as i had given one thousand five
hundred zoltanis for me to which she replied hadst thou been my
fathers i can tell thee i would not have let him part with thee for
twice as much for you christians always tell lies about yourselves and
make yourselves out poor to cheat the moors
that may be lady said i but indeed i dealt truthfully with my
master as i do and mean to do with everybody in the world
to morrow i think said i for there is a vessel here from france
which sails to morrow and i think i shall go in her
would it not be better said zoraida to wait for the arrival of ships
from spain and go with them and not with the french who are not your
no said i though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now
coming from spain it is true i might perhaps wait for it however it
is more likely i shall depart to morrow for the longing i feel to return
to my country and to those i love is so great that it will not allow me
to wait for another opportunity however more convenient if it be
no doubt thou art married in thine own country said zoraida and for
that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife
i am not married i replied but i have given my promise to marry on
and is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it said zoraida
so beautiful said i that to describe her worthily and tell thee the
at this her father laughed very heartily and said by allah christian
she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter who is the most
beautiful woman in all this kingdom only look at her well and thou wilt
zoraidas father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these
words and phrases for though she spoke the bastard language that as i
have said is employed there she expressed her meaning more by signs
while we were still engaged in this conversation a moor came running up
exclaiming that four turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the
garden and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe the old
man was alarmed and zoraida too for the moors commonly and so to
speak instinctively have a dread of the turks but particularly of the
soldiers who are so insolent and domineering to the moors who are under
their power that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves
her father said to zoraida daughter retire into the house and shut
thyself in while i go and speak to these dogs and thou christian pick
thy herbs and go in peace and allah bring thee safe to thy own
i bowed and he went away to look for the turks leaving me alone with
zoraida who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her
but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden turning to me
with her eyes full of tears she said tameji cristiano tameji that is
to say art thou going christian art thou going
i made answer yes lady but not without thee come what may be on the
watch for me on the next juma and be not alarmed when thou seest us for
most surely we shall go to the land of the christians
this i said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed
