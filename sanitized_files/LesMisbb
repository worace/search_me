paris has a child and the forest has a bird the bird is called the
couple these two ideas which contain the one all the furnace the other
all the dawn strike these two sparks together paris childhood there
leaps out from them a little being homuncio plautus would say
this little being is joyous he has not food every day and he goes to
the play every evening if he sees good he has no shirt on his body
no shoes on his feet no roof over his head he is like the flies of
heaven who have none of these things he is from seven to thirteen
years of age he lives in bands roams the streets lodges in the open
air wears an old pair of trousers of his fathers which descend below
his heels an old hat of some other father which descends below his
ears a single suspender of yellow listing he runs lies in wait
rummages about wastes time blackens pipes swears like a convict
haunts the wine shop knows thieves calls gay women thou talks slang
sings obscene songs and has no evil in his heart this is because he
has in his heart a pearl innocence and pearls are not to be dissolved
in mud so long as man is in his childhood god wills that he shall be
if one were to ask that enormous city what is this she would reply
the gamin the street arab of paris is the dwarf of the giant
let us not exaggerate this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt
but in that case he owns but one he sometimes has shoes but then
they have no soles he sometimes has a lodging and he loves it for
he finds his mother there but he prefers the street because there he
finds liberty he has his own games his own bits of mischief whose
foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois his peculiar metaphors
to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root his own occupations
calling hackney coaches letting down carriage steps establishing means
of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains which he
calls making the bridge of arts crying discourses pronounced by the
authorities in favor of the french people cleaning out the cracks
in the pavement he has his own coinage which is composed of all the
little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets
this curious money which receives the name of loques rags has
an invariable and well regulated currency in this little bohemia of
lastly he has his own fauna which he observes attentively in
the corners the lady bird the deaths head plant louse the
daddy long legs the devil a black insect which menaces by twisting
about its tail armed with two horns he has his fabulous monster which
has scales under its belly but is not a lizard which has pustules on
its back but is not a toad which inhabits the nooks of old lime kilns
and wells that have run dry which is black hairy sticky which crawls
sometimes slowly sometimes rapidly which has no cry but which has a
look and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it he calls this
monster the deaf thing the search for these deaf things among
the stones is a joy of formidable nature another pleasure consists in
suddenly prying up a paving stone and taking a look at the wood lice
each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which
are to be found there there are ear wigs in the timber yards of the
ursulines there are millepeds in the pantheon there are tadpoles in
as far as sayings are concerned this child has as many of them as
talleyrand he is no less cynical but he is more honest he is endowed
with a certain indescribable unexpected joviality he upsets the
composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter he ranges boldly
a funeral passes by among those who accompany the dead there is a
doctor hey there shouts some street arab how long has it been
customary for doctors to carry home their own work
another is in a crowd a grave man adorned with spectacles and
trinkets turns round indignantly you good for nothing you have
seized my wifes waist i sir search me
in the evening thanks to a few sous which he always finds means
to procure the homuncio enters a theatre on crossing that magic
threshold he becomes transfigured he was the street arab he becomes
the titi18 theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the
keel in the air it is in that keel that the titi huddle together
the titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva the same being
endowed with wings and soaring it suffices for him to be there with
his radiance of happiness with his power of enthusiasm and joy with
his hand clapping which resembles a clapping of wings to confer on
that narrow dark fetid sordid unhealthy hideous abominable keel
bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary
the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition his tendency and we say
it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic
taste he is not very academic by nature thus to give an example the
popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy
children was seasoned with a touch of irony the gamin called her
this being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights has rags like a
baby and tatters like a philosopher fishes in the sewer hunts in the
cesspool extracts mirth from foulness whips up the squares with his
wit grins and bites whistles and sings shouts and shrieks tempers
alleluia with matantur lurette chants every rhythm from the de
profundis to the jack pudding finds without seeking knows what he is
ignorant of is a spartan to the point of thieving is mad to wisdom is
lyrical to filth would crouch down on olympus wallows in the dunghill
and emerges from it covered with stars the gamin of paris is rabelais
he is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch pocket
he is not easily astonished he is still less easily terrified he makes
songs on superstitions he takes the wind out of exaggerations he twits
mysteries he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts he takes the poetry out
of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas
it is not that he is prosaic far from that but he replaces the solemn
vision by the farcical phantasmagoria if adamastor were to appear to
him the street arab would say hi there the bugaboo
paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street arab two
beings of which no other city is capable the passive acceptance which
contents itself with gazing and the inexhaustible initiative prudhomme
and fouillou paris alone has this in its natural history the whole of
the monarchy is contained in the lounger the whole of anarchy in the
this pale child of the parisian faubourgs lives and develops makes
connections grows supple in suffering in the presence of social
realities and of human things a thoughtful witness he thinks himself
heedless and he is not he looks and is on the verge of laughter he is
on the verge of something else also whoever you may be if your name is
of what clay is he made of the first mud that comes to hand a handful
of dirt a breath and behold adam it suffices for a god to pass by a
god has always passed over the street arab fortune labors at this tiny
being by the word fortune we mean chance to some extent that pigmy
kneaded out of common earth ignorant unlettered giddy vulgar low
will that become an ionian or a boeotian wait currit rota the spirit
of paris that demon which creates the children of chance and the men
of destiny reversing the process of the latin potter makes of a jug an
the gamin loves the city he also loves solitude since he has something
of the sage in him urbis amator like fuscus ruris amator like
to roam thoughtfully about that is to say to lounge is a fine
employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher particularly in that
rather illegitimate species of campaign which is tolerably ugly but
odd and composed of two natures which surrounds certain great cities
notably paris to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal
end of the trees beginning of the roofs end of the grass beginning
of the pavements end of the furrows beginning of the shops end of
the wheel ruts beginning of the passions end of the divine murmur
beginning of the human uproar hence an extraordinary interest
hence in these not very attractive places indelibly stamped by the
passing stroller with the epithet melancholy the apparently objectless
he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers
of paris and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs that
close shaven turf those pebbly paths that chalk those pools
those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands the plants of early
market garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom that mixture of
the savage and the citizen those vast desert nooks where the garrison
drums practise noisily and produce a sort of lisping of battle those
hermits by day and cut throats by night that clumsy mill which turns
in the wind the hoisting wheels of the quarries the tea gardens at the
corners of the cemeteries the mysterious charm of great sombre walls
squarely intersecting immense vague stretches of land inundated with
sunshine and full of butterflies all this attracted him
there is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those
singular spots the glaciere the cunette the hideous wall of grenelle
all speckled with balls mont parnasse the fosse aux loups aubiers on
the bank of the marne mont souris the tombe issoire the pierre plate
de chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which no longer
serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms and which is closed on a
level with the ground by a trap door of rotten planks the campagna of
rome is one idea the banlieue of paris is another to behold nothing
but fields houses or trees in what a stretch of country offers us is
to remain on the surface all aspects of things are thoughts of god the
spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped
with a certain piercing melancholy nature and humanity both appeal
to you at the same time there local originalities there make their
any one who like ourselves has wandered about in these solitudes
contiguous to our faubourgs which may be designated as the limbos of
paris has seen here and there in the most desert spot at the
most unexpected moment behind a meagre hedge or in the corner of a
dusty ragged dishevelled playing hide and seek and crowned with
corn flowers all of them are little ones who have made their escape
from poor families the outer boulevard is their breathing space the
suburbs belong to them there they are eternally playing truant there
they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs there they are or
rather there they exist far from every eye in the sweet light of
may or june kneeling round a hole in the ground snapping marbles with
their thumbs quarrelling over half farthings irresponsible volatile
free and happy and no sooner do they catch sight of you than they
recollect that they have an industry and that they must earn their
living and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled
with cockchafers or a bunch of lilacs these encounters with strange
children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of
sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they
their sisters who are almost young maidens thin feverish with
sunburnt hands covered with freckles crowned with poppies and ears of
rye gay haggard barefooted they can be seen devouring cherries among
the wheat in the evening they can be heard laughing these groups
warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday or indistinctly seen in
the twilight occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time and these
paris centre banlieue circumference this constitutes all the earth
to those children they never venture beyond this they can no more
escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the
water for them nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers

at the epoch nearly contemporary by the way when the action of this
book takes place there was not as there is to day a policeman at
the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss
here stray children abounded in paris the statistics give an average
of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that
period by the police patrols in unenclosed lands in houses in process
of construction and under the arches of the bridges one of these
nests which has become famous produced the swallows of the bridge of
arcola this is moreover the most disastrous of social symptoms all
crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child
let us make an exception in favor of paris nevertheless in a relative
measure and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled the
exception is just while in any other great city the vagabond child is
a lost man while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is in
some sort sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the
public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience the street boy
of paris we insist on this point however defaced and injured on the
surface is almost intact on the interior it is a magnificent thing to
put on record and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our
popular revolutions that a certain incorruptibility results from the
idea which exists in the air of paris as salt exists in the water of
the ocean to breathe paris preserves the soul
what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which
one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around
whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken
family in the civilization of the present day incomplete as it still
is it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families
pouring themselves out into the darkness not knowing clearly what has
become of their children and allowing their own entrails to fall on the
public highway hence these obscure destinies this is called for this
sad thing has given rise to an expression to be cast on the pavements
let it be said by the way that this abandonment of children was not
discouraged by the ancient monarchy a little of egypt and bohemia in
the lower regions suited the upper spheres and compassed the aims of
the powerful the hatred of instruction for the children of the people
was a dogma what is the use of half lights such was the countersign
now the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child
besides this the monarchy sometimes was in need of children and in
under louis xiv not to go any further back the king rightly desired
to create a fleet the idea was a good one but let us consider
the means there can be no fleet if beside the sailing ship that
plaything of the winds and for the purpose of towing it in case of
necessity there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases either
by means of oars or of steam the galleys were then to the marine what
steamers are to day therefore galleys were necessary but the galley
is moved only by the galley slave hence galley slaves were required
colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make
as many convicts as possible the magistracy showed a great deal of
complaisance in the matter a man kept his hat on in the presence of a
procession it was a huguenot attitude he was sent to the galleys a
child was encountered in the streets provided that he was fifteen
years of age and did not know where he was to sleep he was sent to the
under louis xv children disappeared in paris the police carried them
off for what mysterious purpose no one knew people whispered with
terror monstrous conjectures as to the kings baths of purple barbier
speaks ingenuously of these things it sometimes happened that the
exempts of the guard when they ran short of children took those who
had fathers the fathers in despair attacked the exempts in that
case the parliament intervened and had some one hung who the exempts
chapter vii the gamin should have his place in the classifications of
the body of street arabs in paris almost constitutes a caste one might
almost say not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so
this word gamin was printed for the first time and reached popular
speech through the literary tongue in 1834 it is in a little work
entitled claude gueux that this word made its appearance the horror was
the elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each
other are very various we have known and associated with one who was
greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from
the top of the tower of notre dame another because he had succeeded in
making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome
of the invalides had been temporarily deposited and had prigged some
lead from them a third because he had seen a diligence tip over still
another because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye
this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin a profound
epiphonema which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending dieu
de dieu what ill luck i do have to think that i have never yet seen
anybody tumble from a fifth story window i have pronounced iave and
surely this saying of a peasant is a fine one father so and so your
wife has died of her malady why did you not send for the doctor
what would you have sir we poor folks die of ourselves but if
the peasants whole passivity lies in this saying the whole of the
free thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is assuredly
contained in this other saying a man condemned to death is listening
to his confessor in the tumbrel the child of paris exclaims he is
talking to his black cap oh the sneak
a certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin to be
to be present at executions constitutes a duty he shows himself at the
guillotine and he laughs he calls it by all sorts of pet names the
end of the soup the growler the mother in the blue the sky the last
mouthful etc etc in order not to lose anything of the affair he
scales the walls he hoists himself to balconies he ascends trees he
suspends himself to gratings he clings fast to chimneys the gamin is
born a tiler as he is born a mariner a roof inspires him with no more
fear than a mast there is no festival which comes up to an execution
on the place de greve samson and the abbe montes are the truly popular
names they hoot at the victim in order to encourage him they sometimes
admire him lacenaire when a gamin on seeing the hideous dautin die
bravely uttered these words which contain a future i was jealous of
him in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known but papavoine
is politicians are confused with assassins in the same legend
they have a tradition as to everybodys last garment it is known that
tolleron had a firemans cap avril an otter cap losvel a round hat
that old delaporte was bald and bare headed that castaing was all ruddy
and very handsome that bories had a romantic small beard that jean
martin kept on his suspenders that lecouffe and his mother quarrelled
dont reproach each other for your basket shouted a gamin to them
another in order to get a look at debacker as he passed and being too
small in the crowd caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed
it a gendarme stationed opposite frowned let me climb up msieu le
gendarme said the gamin and to soften the heart of the authorities
he added i will not fall i dont care if you do retorted the
in the brotherhood of gamins a memorable accident counts for a great
deal one reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut
ones self very deeply to the very bone
the fist is no mediocre element of respect one of the things that the
gamin is fondest of saying is i am fine and strong come now to be
left handed renders you very enviable a squint is highly esteemed
chapter viii in which the reader will find a charming saying of the
in summer he metamorphoses himself into a frog and in the evening
when night is falling in front of the bridges of austerlitz and jena
from the tops of coal wagons and the washerwomens boats he hurls
himself headlong into the seine and into all possible infractions of
the laws of modesty and of the police nevertheless the police keep an
eye on him and the result is a highly dramatic situation which
once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry that cry which was
celebrated about 1830 is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin it
scans like a verse from homer with a notation as inexpressible as the
eleusiac chant of the panathenaea and in it one encounters again the
ancient evohe here it is ohe titi oheee here comes the bobby here
comes the plice pick up your duds and be off through the sewer with
sometimes this gnat that is what he calls himself knows how to read
sometimes he knows how to write he always knows how to daub he
does not hesitate to acquire by no one knows what mysterious mutual
instruction all the talents which can be of use to the public from
1815 to 1830 he imitated the cry of the turkey from 1830 to 1848 he
scrawled pears on the walls one summer evening when louis philippe was
returning home on foot he saw a little fellow no higher than his knee
perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one
of the pillars of the gate of neuilly the king with that good nature
which came to him from henry iv helped the gamin finished the pear
and gave the child a louis saying the pear is on that also19
the gamin loves uproar a certain state of violence pleases him he
execrates the cures one day in the rue de luniversite one of these
scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of no
69 why are you doing that at the gate a passer by asked the boy
replied there is a cure there it was there in fact that the papal
nevertheless whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin if
the occasion to become a chorister presents itself it is quite possible
that he will accept and in that case he serves the mass civilly there
are two things to which he plays tantalus and which he always desires
without ever attaining them to overthrow the government and to get his
the gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of paris and
can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to
meet he can tell them off on the tips of his fingers he studies their
habits and he has special notes on each one of them he reads the souls
of the police like an open book he will tell you fluently and without
flinching such an one is a traitor such another is very malicious
such another is great such another is ridiculous all these words
traitor malicious great ridiculous have a particular meaning in his
mouth that one imagines that he owns the pont neuf and he prevents
people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet that other has a
there was something of that boy in poquelin the son of the fish market
beaumarchais had something of it gaminerie is a shade of the gallic
spirit mingled with good sense it sometimes adds force to the latter
as alcohol does to wine sometimes it is a defect homer repeats himself
eternally granted one may say that voltaire plays the gamin camille
desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs championnet who treated
miracles brutally rose from the pavements of paris he had when a
small lad inundated the porticos of saint jean de beauvais and of
saint etienne du mont he had addressed the shrine of sainte genevieve
familiarly to give orders to the phial of saint januarius
the gamin of paris is respectful ironical and insolent he has
villainous teeth because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers and
handsome eyes because he has wit if jehovah himself were present he
would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot he is strong on
boxing all beliefs are possible to him he plays in the gutter and
straightens himself up with a revolt his effrontery persists even in
the presence of grape shot he was a scapegrace he is a hero like the
little theban he shakes the skin from the lion barra the drummer boy
was a gamin of paris he shouts forward as the horse of scripture
says vah and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the
this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal measure that
spread of wings which reaches from moliere to barra
to sum up the whole and in one word the gamin is a being who amuses
to sum it all up once more the paris gamin of to day like the
graeculus of rome in days gone by is the infant populace with the
wrinkle of the old world on his brow
the gamin is a grace to the nation and at the same time a disease a
disease which must be cured how by light
all generous social irradiations spring from science letters arts
education make men make men give them light that they may warm
you sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will
present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth
and then those who govern under the superintendence of the french idea
will have to make this choice the children of france or the gamins of
paris flames in the light or will o the wisps in the gloom
the gamin expresses paris and paris expresses the world
for paris is a total paris is the ceiling of the human race the whole
of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living
manners he who sees paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with
heaven and constellations in the intervals paris has a capital the

saint antoine an asinarium the sorbonne a pantheon the pantheon a
via sacra the boulevard des italiens a temple of the winds opinion

the faubourgs above all we maintain that the parisian race appears
there is the pure blood there is the true physiognomy there this
people toils and suffers and suffering and toil are the two faces of
man there exist there immense numbers of unknown beings among whom
swarm types of the strangest from the porter of la rapee to the knacker

rabble multitude populace these are words and quickly uttered but
so be it what does it matter what is it to me if they do go barefoot
they do not know how to read so much the worse would you abandon them
for that would you turn their distress into a malediction cannot the
light penetrate these masses let us return to that cry light and let
us obstinately persist therein light light who knows whether
these opacities will not become transparent are not revolutions
transfigurations come philosophers teach enlighten light up think

boughs from the oaks make a whirlwind of the idea this crowd may

conflagration of principles and virtues which sparkles bursts forth
and quivers at certain hours these bare feet these bare arms these
rags these ignorances these abjectnesses these darknesses may be
employed in the conquest of the ideal gaze past the people and you
will perceive truth let that vile sand which you trample under foot be

eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this
story people noticed on the boulevard du temple and in the regions of
the chateau deau a little boy eleven or twelve years of age who would
have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched
out above if with the laugh of his age on his lips he had not had a
heart absolutely sombre and empty this child was well muffled up in a
pair of mans trousers but he did not get them from his father and a
womans chemise but he did not get it from his mother some people or
other had clothed him in rags out of charity still he had a father and
a mother but his father did not think of him and his mother did not
he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of
those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless
this child never felt so well as when he was in the street the
pavements were less hard to him than his mothers heart
his parents had despatched him into life with a kick
he was a boisterous pallid nimble wide awake jeering lad with a
vivacious but sickly air he went and came sang played at hopscotch
scraped the gutters stole a little but like cats and sparrows gayly
laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief
he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because
when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social
order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they
escape because of their smallness the tiniest hole saves them
nevertheless abandoned as this child was it sometimes happened every
two or three months that he said come ill go and see mamma then
he quitted the boulevard the cirque the porte saint martin descended
to the quays crossed the bridges reached the suburbs arrived at the
salpetriere and came to a halt where precisely at that double number
50 52 with which the reader is acquainted at the gorbeau hovel
at that epoch the hovel 50 52 generally deserted and eternally
decorated with the placard chambers to let chanced to be a rare
thing inhabited by numerous individuals who however as is always the
case in paris had no connection with each other all belonged to
that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty
bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances and which extends from misery
to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings
in whom all the material things of civilization end the sewer man who
sweeps up the mud and the ragpicker who collects scraps
the principal lodger of jean valjeans day was dead and had been
replaced by another exactly like her i know not what philosopher has
this new old woman was named madame bourgon and had nothing remarkable
about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets who had reigned in
the most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of
four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already
well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the
at first sight this family presented no very special feature except its
extreme destitution the father when he hired the chamber had stated
that his name was jondrette some time after his moving in which had
borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all to
borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant this jondrette
had said to the woman who like her predecessor was at the same time
portress and stair sweeper mother so and so if any one should chance
to come and inquire for a pole or an italian or even a spaniard
this family was that of the merry barefoot boy he arrived there and
found distress and what is still sadder no smile a cold hearth
and cold hearts when he entered he was asked whence come you he
replied from the street when he went away they asked him whither
are you going he replied into the streets his mother said to him
this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants
which spring up in cellars it did not cause him suffering and he
blamed no one he did not know exactly how a father and mother should
we have forgotten to mention that on the boulevard du temple this child
was called little gavroche why was he called little gavroche
it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the
the chamber which the jondrettes inhabited in the gorbeau hovel was the
last at the end of the corridor the cell next to it was occupied by a
very poor young man who was called m marius
let us explain who this m marius was
chapter i ninety years and thirty two teeth
in the rue boucherat rue de normandie and the rue de saintonge there
still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a
worthy man named m gillenormand and who mention him with complaisance
this good man was old when they were young this silhouette has not yet
entirely disappeared for those who regard with melancholy that vague
swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets
in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv the names of
all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day the
streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the
capitals of europe a progression by the way in which progress is
mgillenormand who was as much alive as possible in 1831 was one of
those men who had become curiosities to be viewed simply because
they have lived a long time and who are strange because they formerly
resembled everybody and now resemble nobody he was a peculiar old man
and in very truth a man of another age the real complete and rather
haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century who wore his good old
bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates he
was over ninety years of age his walk was erect he talked loudly saw
clearly drank neat ate slept and snored he had all thirty two of
his teeth he only wore spectacles when he read he was of an amorous
disposition but declared that for the last ten years he had wholly
and decidedly renounced women he could no longer please he said he
did not add i am too old but i am too poor he said if i were
not ruined heee all he had left in fact was an income of about
fifteen thousand francs his dream was to come into an inheritance and
to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses he did
not belong as the reader will perceive to that puny variety of
octogenaries who like m de voltaire have been dying all their life
his was no longevity of a cracked pot this jovial old man had always
had good health he was superficial rapid easily angered he flew into
a passion at everything generally quite contrary to all reason when
contradicted he raised his cane he beat people as he had done in the
great century he had a daughter over fifty years of age and unmarried
whom he chastised severely with his tongue when in a rage and whom he
would have liked to whip she seemed to him to be eight years old he
boxed his servants ears soundly and said ah carogne one of his
oaths was by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade he had singular
freaks of tranquillity he had himself shaved every day by a barber who
had been mad and who detested him being jealous of m gillenormand on
account of his wife a pretty and coquettish barberess m gillenormand
admired his own discernment in all things and declared that he was
extremely sagacious here is one of his sayings i have in truth some
penetration i am able to say when a flea bites me from what woman it
the words which he uttered the most frequently were the sensible man
and nature he did not give to this last word the grand acceptation
which our epoch has accorded to it but he made it enter after his own
fashion into his little chimney corner satires nature he said in
order that civilization may have a little of everything gives it even
specimens of its amusing barbarism europe possesses specimens of asia
and africa on a small scale the cat is a drawing room tiger the lizard
is a pocket crocodile the dancers at the opera are pink female savages
they do not eat men they crunch them or magicians that they are they
transform them into oysters and swallow them the caribbeans leave only
the bones they leave only the shell such are our morals we do not
devour we gnaw we do not exterminate we claw
he lived in the marais rue des filles du calvaire no 6 he owned the
house this house has since been demolished and rebuilt and the number
has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the
streets of paris undergo he occupied an ancient and vast apartment
on the first floor between street and gardens furnished to the very
ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing
pastoral scenes the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were
repeated in miniature on the arm chairs he enveloped his bed in a vast
nine leaved screen of coromandel lacquer long full curtains hung from
the windows and formed great broken folds that were very magnificent
the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that
one of them which formed the angle by means of a staircase twelve or
fifteen steps long which the old gentleman ascended and descended with
great agility in addition to a library adjoining his chamber he had a
boudoir of which he thought a great deal a gallant and elegant retreat
with magnificent hangings of straw with a pattern of flowers and
fleurs de lys made on the galleys of louis xiv and ordered of his
convicts by m de vivonne for his mistress m gillenormand had
inherited it from a grim maternal great aunt who had died a
centenarian he had had two wives his manners were something between
those of the courtier which he had never been and the lawyer which
he might have been he was gay and caressing when he had a mind in
his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their
wives and never by their mistresses because they are at the same
time the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in
existence he was a connoisseur of painting he had in his chamber a
marvellous portrait of no one knows whom painted by jordaens executed
with great dashes of the brush with millions of details in a confused
and hap hazard manner m gillenormands attire was not the habit of
louis xiv nor yet that of louis xvi it was that of the incroyables
of the directory he had thought himself young up to that period and
had followed the fashions his coat was of light weight cloth with
voluminous revers a long swallow tail and large steel buttons with
this he wore knee breeches and buckle shoes he always thrust his hands
into his fobs he said authoritatively the french revolution is a heap
at the age of sixteen one evening at the opera he had had the honor
to be stared at through opera glasses by two beauties at the same
time ripe and celebrated beauties then and sung by voltaire the
camargo and the salle caught between two fires he had beaten a heroic
retreat towards a little dancer a young girl named nahenry who was
sixteen like himself obscure as a cat and with whom he was in love
he abounded in memories he was accustomed to exclaim how pretty she
was that guimard guimardini guimardinette the last time i saw her
at longchamps her hair curled in sustained sentiments with her
come and see of turquoises her gown of the color of persons newly
arrived and her little agitation muff he had worn in his young
manhood a waistcoat of nain londrin which he was fond of talking about
effusively i was dressed like a turk of the levant levantin said he
madame de boufflers having seen him by chance when he was twenty had
described him as a charming fool he was horrified by all the names
which he saw in politics and in power regarding them as vulgar and
bourgeois he read the journals the newspapers the gazettes as he
said stifling outbursts of laughter the while oh he said what
people these are corbiere humann casimir perier theres a minister
for you i can imagine this in a journal m gillenorman minister
that would be a farce well they are so stupid that it would pass he
merrily called everything by its name whether decent or indecent and
did not restrain himself in the least before ladies he uttered coarse
speeches obscenities and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack
of astonishment which was elegant it was in keeping with the
unceremoniousness of his century it is to be noted that the age of
periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose his god father
had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius and had bestowed
on him these two significant names luc esprit
he had taken prizes in his boyhood at the college of moulins where he
was born and he had been crowned by the hand of the duc de nivernais
whom he called the duc de nevers neither the convention nor the death
of louis xvi nor the napoleon nor the return of the bourbons nor
