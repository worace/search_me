i did not said sancho but i found her winnowing two bushels of wheat
then depend upon it said don quixote the grains of that wheat were
pearls when touched by her hands and didst thou look friend was it
then i promise thee said don quixote that winnowed by her hands
beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest but go on when thou
gavest her my letter did she kiss it did she place it on her head did
she perform any ceremony befitting it or what did she do
when i went to give it to her replied sancho she was hard at it
swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve and
she said to me lay the letter friend on the top of that sack for i
cannot read it until i have done sifting all this
discreet lady said don quixote that was in order to read it at her
leisure and enjoy it proceed sancho while she was engaged in her
occupation what converse did she hold with thee what did she ask about
me and what answer didst thou give make haste tell me all and let not
an atom be left behind in the ink bottle
she asked me nothing said sancho but i told her how your worship was
left doing penance in her service naked from the waist up in among
these mountains like a savage sleeping on the ground not eating bread
off a tablecloth nor combing your beard weeping and cursing your
in saying i cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong said don quixote for
rather do i bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for
having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as dulcinea del
and so lofty she is said sancho that she overtops me by more than a
what sancho said don quixote didst thou measure with her
i measured in this way said sancho going to help her to put a sack
of wheat on the back of an ass we came so close together that i could
see she stood more than a good palm over me
well said don quixote and doth she not of a truth accompany and
adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind but one
thing thou wilt not deny sancho when thou camest close to her didst
thou not perceive a sabaean odour an aromatic fragrance a i know not
what delicious that i cannot find a name for i mean a redolence an
exhalation as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover
all i can say is said sancho that i did perceive a little odour
something goaty it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard
it could not be that said don quixote but thou must have been
suffering from cold in the head or must have smelt thyself for i know
well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns that lily of the
maybe so replied sancho there often comes from myself that same
odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady dulcinea
but thats no wonder for one devil is like another
well then continued don quixote now she has done sifting the corn
and sent it to the mill what did she do when she read the letter
as for the letter said sancho she did not read it for she said she
could neither read nor write instead of that she tore it up into small
pieces saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her
secrets should become known in the village and that what i had told her
by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her and the
extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake was enough and to
make an end of it she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your
hands and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you
and that therefore she entreated and commanded you on sight of this
present to come out of these thickets and to have done with carrying on
absurdities and to set out at once for el toboso unless something else
of greater importance should happen for she had a great desire to see
your worship she laughed greatly when i told her how your worship was
called the knight of the rueful countenance i asked her if that biscayan
the other day had been there and she told me he had and that he was an
honest fellow i asked her too about the galley slaves but she said she
so far all goes well said don quixote but tell me what jewel was it
that she gave thee on taking thy leave in return for thy tidings of me
for it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to
give the squires damsels or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to
the knights or of their knights to the ladies some rich jewel as a
guerdon for good news and acknowledgment of the message
that is very likely said sancho and a good custom it was to my
mind but that must have been in days gone by for now it would seem to
be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese because that was
what my lady dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard wall when i took
leave of her and more by token it was sheeps milk cheese
she is generous in the extreme said don quixote and if she did not
give thee a jewel of gold no doubt it must have been because she had not
one to hand there to give thee but sleeves are good after easter i
shall see her and all shall be made right but knowest thou what amazes
me sancho it seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air
for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to el toboso
and return though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there
from which i am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my
friend and watches over my interests for of necessity there is and must
be one or else i should not be a right knight errant that this same i
say must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge for some of
these sages will catch up a knight errant sleeping in his bed and
without his knowing how or in what way it happened he wakes up the next
day more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to
sleep and if it were not for this knights errant would not be able to
give aid to one another in peril as they do at every turn for a knight
maybe is fighting in the mountains of armenia with some dragon or
fierce serpent or another knight and gets the worst of the battle and
is at the point of death but when he least looks for it there appears
over against him on a cloud or chariot of fire another knight a friend
of his who just before had been in england and who takes his part and
delivers him from death and at night he finds himself in his own
quarters supping very much to his satisfaction and yet from one place to
the other will have been two or three thousand leagues and all this is
done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those
valiant knights so that friend sancho i find no difficulty in
believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to el toboso and
returned in such a short time since as i have said some friendly sage
must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it
that must have been it said sancho for indeed rocinante went like a
quicksilver said don quixote aye and what is more a legion of
devils folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary
exactly as the whim seizes them but putting this aside what thinkest
thou i ought to do about my ladys command to go and see her for though
i feel that i am bound to obey her mandate i feel too that i am debarred
by the boon i have accorded to the princess that accompanies us and the
law of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my
inclination on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and
harasses me on the other my solemn promise and the glory i shall win in
this enterprise urge and call me but what i think i shall do is to
travel with all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is
and on my arrival i shall cut off his head and establish the princess
peacefully in her realm and forthwith i shall return to behold the light
that lightens my senses to whom i shall make such excuses that she will
be led to approve of my delay for she will see that it entirely tends to
increase her glory and fame for all that i have won am winning or
shall win by arms in this life comes to me of the favour she extends to
ah what a sad state your worships brains are in said sancho tell
me senor do you mean to travel all that way for nothing and to let
slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a
portion a kingdom that in sober truth i have heard say is more than
twenty thousand leagues round about and abounds with all things
necessary to support human life and is bigger than portugal and castile
put together peace for the love of god blush for what you have said
and take my advice and forgive me and marry at once in the first
village where there is a curate if not here is our licentiate who will
do the business beautifully remember i am old enough to give advice
and this i am giving comes pat to the purpose for a sparrow in the hand
is better than a vulture on the wing and he who has the good to his hand
and chooses the bad that the good he complains of may not come to him
look here sancho said don quixote if thou art advising me to marry
in order that immediately on slaying the giant i may become king and be
able to confer favours on thee and give thee what i have promised let
me tell thee i shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without
marrying for before going into battle i will make it a stipulation that
if i come out of it victorious even i do not marry they shall give me a
portion portion of the kingdom that i may bestow it upon whomsoever i
choose and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow
that is plain speaking said sancho but let your worship take care to
choose it on the seacoast so that if i dont like the life i may be
able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as i have said
dont mind going to see my lady dulcinea now but go and kill this giant
and let us finish off this business for by god it strikes me it will be
i hold thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixote and i
will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see
dulcinea but i counsel thee not to say anything to any one or to those
who are with us about what we have considered and discussed for as
dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known
it is not right that i or anyone for me should disclose them
well then if that be so said sancho how is it that your worship
makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before
my lady dulcinea this being the same thing as signing your name to it
that you love her and are her lover and as those who go must perforce
kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves
to her how can the thoughts of both of you be hid
o how silly and simple thou art said don quixote seest thou not
sancho that this tends to her greater exaltation for thou must know
that according to our way of thinking in chivalry it is a high honour to
a lady to have many knights errant in her service whose thoughts never
go beyond serving her for her own sake and who look for no other reward
for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to
it is with that kind of love said sancho i have heard preachers say
we ought to love our lord for himself alone without being moved by the
hope of glory or the fear of punishment though for my part i would
rather love and serve him for what he could do
the devil take thee for a clown said don quixote and what shrewd
things thou sayest at times one would think thou hadst studied
master nicholas here called out to them to wait a while as they wanted
to halt and drink at a little spring there was there don quixote drew
up not a little to the satisfaction of sancho for he was by this time
weary of telling so many lies and in dread of his master catching him
tripping for though he knew that dulcinea was a peasant girl of el
toboso he had never seen her in all his life cardenio had now put on
the clothes which dorothea was wearing when they found her and though
they were not very good they were far better than those he put off they
dismounted together by the side of the spring and with what the curate
had provided himself with at the inn they appeased though not very well
the keen appetite they all of them brought with them
while they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on
his way who stopping to examine the party at the spring the next moment
ran to don quixote and clasping him round the legs began to weep freely
saying o senor do you not know me look at me well i am that lad
andres that your worship released from the oak tree where i was tied
don quixote recognised him and taking his hand he turned to those
present and said that your worships may see how important it is to have
knights errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and
wicked men in this world i may tell you that some days ago passing
through a wood i heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in
pain and distress i immediately hastened impelled by my bounden duty
to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed and
i found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you which in my
heart i rejoice at for his testimony will not permit me to depart from
the truth in any particular he was i say tied to an oak naked from
the waist up and a clown whom i afterwards found to be his master was
scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare as soon as i saw him
i asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation the boor replied that he
was flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness
that proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity on which this boy
said senor he flogs me only because i ask for my wages the master
made i know not what speeches and explanations which though i listened
to them i did not accept in short i compelled the clown to unbind him
and to swear he would take him with him and pay him real by real and
perfumed into the bargain is not all this true andres my son didst
thou not mark with what authority i commanded him and with what humility
he promised to do all i enjoined specified and required of him answer
without hesitation tell these gentlemen what took place that they may
see that it is as great an advantage as i say to have knights errant
all that your worship has said is quite true answered the lad but
the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship
how the opposite said don quixote did not the clown pay thee then
not only did he not pay me replied the lad but as soon as your
worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone he tied me up again
to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging that left me like a flayed
saint bartholomew and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some
jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship and but for the
pain i was suffering i should have laughed at the things he said in
short he left me in such a condition that i have been until now in a
hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown
inflicted on me then for all which your worship is to blame for if you
had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you nor
meddled in other peoples affairs my master would have been content with
giving me one or two dozen lashes and would have then loosed me and paid
me what he owed me but when your worship abused him so out of measure
and gave him so many hard words his anger was kindled and as he could
not revenge himself on you as soon as he saw you had left him the storm
burst upon me in such a way that i feel as if i should never be a man
the mischief said don quixote lay in my going away for i should not
have gone until i had seen thee paid because i ought to have known well
by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if he
finds it will not suit him to keep it but thou rememberest andres that
i swore if he did not pay thee i would go and seek him and find him
though he were to hide himself in the whales belly
that is true said andres but it was of no use
thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not said don quixote and
so saying he got up hastily and bade sancho bridle rocinante who was
browsing while they were eating dorothea asked him what he meant to do
he replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him
for such iniquitous conduct and see andres paid to the last maravedi
despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world to which she
replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he
could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers and that
as he knew this better than anyone he should restrain his ardour until
that is true said don quixote and andres must have patience until my
return as you say senora but i once more swear and promise not to stop
until i have seen him avenged and paid
i have no faith in those oaths said andres i would rather have now
something to help me to get to seville than all the revenges in the
world if you have here anything to eat that i can take with me give it
me and god be with your worship and all knights errant and may their
errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me
sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese
and giving them to the lad he said here take this brother andres for
we have all of us a share in your misfortune
this share of bread and cheese i am giving you answered sancho and
god knows whether i shall feel the want of it myself or not for i would
have you know friend that we squires to knights errant have to bear a
great deal of hunger and hard fortune and even other things more easily
andres seized his bread and cheese and seeing that nobody gave him
anything more bent his head and took hold of the road as the saying
is however before leaving he said for the love of god sir
knight errant if you ever meet me again though you may see them cutting
me to pieces give me no aid or succour but leave me to my misfortune
which will not be so great but that a greater will come to me by being
helped by your worship on whom and all the knights errant that have ever
don quixote was getting up to chastise him but he took to his heels at
such a pace that no one attempted to follow him and mightily chapfallen
was don quixote at andres story and the others had to take great care
to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of
which treats of what befell don quixotes party at the inn
their dainty repast being finished they saddled at once and without any
adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn the object of
sancho panzas fear and dread but though he would have rather not
entered it there was no help for it the landlady the landlord their
daughter and maritornes when they saw don quixote and sancho coming
went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction which don
quixote received with dignity and gravity and bade them make up a better
bed for him than the last time to which the landlady replied that if he
paid better than he did the last time she would give him one fit for a
prince don quixote said he would so they made up a tolerable one for
him in the same garret as before and he lay down at once being sorely
no sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the
barber and seizing him by the beard said
by my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer you
must give me back tail for it is a shame the way that thing of my
husbands goes tossing about on the floor i mean the comb that i used to
but for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the
licentiate told him to let her have it as there was now no further
occasion for that stratagem because he might declare himself and appear
in his own character and tell don quixote that he had fled to this inn
when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him and should he ask for
the princesss squire they could tell him that she had sent him on
before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was
coming and bringing with her the deliverer of them all on this the
barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady and at the same time
they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect don
quixotes deliverance all the people of the inn were struck with
astonishment at the beauty of dorothea and even at the comely figure of
the shepherd cardenio the curate made them get ready such fare as there
was in the inn and the landlord in hope of better payment served them
up a tolerably good dinner all this time don quixote was asleep and
they thought it best not to waken him as sleeping would now do him more
while at dinner the company consisting of the landlord his wife their
daughter maritornes and all the travellers they discussed the strange
craze of don quixote and the manner in which he had been found and the
landlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier and
then looking round to see if sancho was there when she saw he was not
she gave them the whole story of his blanketing which they received with
no little amusement but on the curate observing that it was the books of
chivalry which don quixote had read that had turned his brain the
i cannot understand how that can be for in truth to my mind there is no
better reading in the world and i have here two or three of them with
other writings that are the very life not only of myself but of plenty
more for when it is harvest time the reapers flock here on holidays
and there is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of
these books and we gather round him thirty or more of us and stay
listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young
again at least i can say for myself that when i hear of what furious and
terrible blows the knights deliver i am seized with the longing to do
the same and i would like to be hearing about them night and day
and i just as much said the landlady because i never have a quiet
moment in my house except when you are listening to some one reading for
then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold
that is true said maritornes and faith i relish hearing these
things greatly too for they are very pretty especially when they
describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange
trees and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy
and fright all this i say is as good as honey
and you what do you think young lady said the curate turning to the
i dont know indeed senor said she i listen too and to tell the
truth though i do not understand it i like hearing it but it is not
the blows that my father likes that i like but the laments the knights
utter when they are separated from their ladies and indeed they
sometimes make me weep with the pity i feel for them
then you would console them if it was for you they wept young lady
i dont know what i should do said the girl i only know that there
are some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers and
lions and a thousand other foul names and jesus i dont know what sort
of folk they can be so unfeeling and heartless that rather than bestow
a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad i dont know
what is the good of such prudery if it is for honours sake why not
hush child said the landlady it seems to me thou knowest a great
deal about these things and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so
as the gentleman asked me i could not help answering him said the
well then said the curate bring me these books senor landlord for
with all my heart said he and going into his own room he brought out
an old valise secured with a little chain on opening which the curate
found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very good
hand the first that he opened he found to be don cirongilio of thrace
and the second don felixmarte of hircania and the other the history
of the great captain gonzalo hernandez de cordova with the life of diego
when the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber
and said we want my friends housekeeper and niece here now
nay said the barber i can do just as well to carry them to the yard
or to the hearth and there is a very good fire there
what your worship would burn my books said the landlord
only these two said the curate don cirongilio and felixmarte
are my books then heretics or phlegmaties that you want to burn them
schismatics you mean friend said the barber not phlegmatics
thats it said the landlord but if you want to burn any let it be
that about the great captain and that diego garcia for i would rather
have a child of mine burnt than either of the others
brother said the curate those two books are made up of lies and are
full of folly and nonsense but this of the great captain is a true
history and contains the deeds of gonzalo hernandez of cordova who by
his many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of
the great captain a famous and illustrious name and deserved by him
alone and this diego garcia de paredes was a distinguished knight of the
city of trujillo in estremadura a most gallant soldier and of such
bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill wheel in full
motion and posted with a two handed sword at the foot of a bridge he
kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it and achieved such
other exploits that if instead of his relating them himself with the
modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history some free and
unbiassed writer had recorded them they would have thrown into the shade
all the deeds of the hectors achilleses and rolands
tell that to my father said the landlord theres a thing to be
astonished at stopping a mill wheel by god your worship should read
what i have read of felixmarte of hircania how with one single
backstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they had
been made of bean pods like the little friars the children make and
another time he attacked a very great and powerful army in which there
were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers all armed from
head to foot and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of sheep
and then what do you say to the good cirongilio of thrace that was so
stout and bold as may be seen in the book where it is related that as
he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the water
against him a fiery serpent and he as soon as he saw it flung himself
upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders and squeezed its throat
with both hands with such force that the serpent finding he was
throttling it had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of
the river carrying with it the knight who would not let go his hold and
when they got down there he found himself among palaces and gardens so
pretty that it was a wonder to see and then the serpent changed itself
into an old ancient man who told him such things as were never heard
hold your peace senor for if you were to hear this you would go mad
with delight a couple of figs for your great captain and your diego
hearing this dorothea said in a whisper to cardenio our landlord is
almost fit to play a second part to don quixote
i think so said cardenio for as he shows he accepts it as a
certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is
written down and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him
but consider brother said the curate once more there never was any
felixmarte of hircania in the world nor any cirongilio of thrace or any
of the other knights of the same sort that the books of chivalry talk
of the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle wits
devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling the time as
your reapers do when they read for i swear to you in all seriousness
there never were any such knights in the world and no such exploits or
try that bone on another dog said the landlord as if i did not know
how many make five and where my shoe pinches me dont think to feed me
with pap for by god i am no fool it is a good joke for your worship to
try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and
lies and they printed by the license of the lords of the royal council
as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed
all together and so many battles and enchantments that they take away
i have told you friend said the curate that this is done to divert
our idle thoughts and as in well ordered states games of chess fives
and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care or
are not obliged or are unable to work so books of this kind are allowed
to be printed on the supposition that what indeed is the truth there
can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories and if
it were permitted me now and the present company desired it i could say
something about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good
ones that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some but i
hope the time will come when i can communicate my ideas to some one who
may be able to mend matters and in the meantime senor landlord believe
what i have said and take your books and make up your mind about their
truth or falsehood and much good may they do you and god grant you may
not fall lame of the same foot your guest don quixote halts on
no fear of that returned the landlord i shall not be so mad as to
make a knight errant of myself for i see well enough that things are not
now as they used to be in those days when they say those famous knights
sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation and he
was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about
knights errant being now no longer in vogue and all books of chivalry
being folly and lies and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what
came of this journey of his masters and if it did not turn out as
happily as his master expected he determined to leave him and go back to
his wife and children and his ordinary labour
the landlord was carrying away the valise and the books but the curate
said to him wait i want to see what those papers are that are written
in such a good hand the landlord taking them out handed them to him to
read and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of
manuscript with in large letters at the beginning the title of novel
of the ill advised curiosity the curate read three or four lines to
himself and said i must say the title of this novel does not seem to
me a bad one and i feel an inclination to read it all to which the
landlord replied then your reverence will do well to read it for i can
tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased
with it and have begged it of me very earnestly but i would not give
it meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise books and
papers here for maybe he will return here some time or other and though
i know i shall miss the books faith i mean to return them for though i
am an innkeeper still i am a christian
you are very right friend said the curate but for all that if the
novel pleases me you must let me copy it
while they were talking cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read
it and forming the same opinion of it as the curate he begged him to
read it so that they might all hear it
i would read it said the curate if the time would not be better
it will be rest enough for me said dorothea to while away the time
by listening to some tale for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to
let me sleep when it would be seasonable
well then in that case said the curate i will read it if it were
only out of curiosity perhaps it may contain something pleasant
master nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect and sancho too
seeing which and considering that he would give pleasure to all and
receive it himself the curate said well then attend to me everyone
in which is related the novel of the ill advised curiosity
in florence a rich and famous city of italy in the province called
tuscany there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality anselmo and
lothario such great friends that by way of distinction they were called
by all that knew them the two friends they were unmarried young of
the same age and of the same tastes which was enough to account for the
reciprocal friendship between them anselmo it is true was somewhat
more inclined to seek pleasure in love than lothario for whom the
pleasures of the chase had more attraction but on occasion anselmo would
forego his own tastes to yield to those of lothario and lothario would
surrender his to fall in with those of anselmo and in this way their
inclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that
the best regulated clock could not surpass it
anselmo was deep in love with a high born and beautiful maiden of the
same city the daughter of parents so estimable and so estimable
herself that he resolved with the approval of his friend lothario
without whom he did nothing to ask her of them in marriage and did so
lothario being the bearer of the demand and conducting the negotiation
so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in
possession of the object of his desires and camilla so happy in having
won anselmo for her husband that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven
and to lothario by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her the
first few days those of a wedding being usually days of merry making
lothario frequented his friend anselmos house as he had been wont
striving to do honour to him and to the occasion and to gratify him in
every way he could but when the wedding days were over and the
succession of visits and congratulations had slackened he began
purposely to leave off going to the house of anselmo for it seemed to
him as it naturally would to all men of sense that friends houses
ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in
their masters bachelor days because though true and genuine friendship
cannot and should not be in any way suspicious still a married mans
honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from
brothers much more from friends anselmo remarked the cessation of
lotharios visits and complained of it to him saying that if he had
known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his society as he used
he would have never married and that if by the thorough harmony that
subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a
sweet name as that of the two friends he should not allow a title so
rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act
circumspectly and so he entreated him if such a phrase was allowable
between them to be once more master of his house and to come in and go
out as formerly assuring him that his wife camilla had no other desire
or inclination than that which he would wish her to have and that
knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see such
to all this and much more that anselmo said to lothario to persuade him
to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing lothario
replied with so much prudence sense and judgment that anselmo was
satisfied of his friends good intentions and it was agreed that on two
days in the week and on holidays lothario should come to dine with him
but though this arrangement was made between them lothario resolved to
observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the
honour of his friend whose good name was more to him than his own he
said and justly that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a
beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to
his house as what female friends his wife associated with for what
cannot be done or arranged in the market place in church at public
festivals or at stations opportunities that husbands cannot always deny
their wives may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or
relative in whom most confidence is reposed lothario said too that
every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any
negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct for it will sometimes
happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either
he does not caution her or not to vex her refrains from telling her to
do or not to do certain things doing or avoiding which may be a matter
of honour or reproach to him and errors of this kind he could easily
correct if warned by a friend but where is such a friend to be found as
lothario would have so judicious so loyal and so true
of a truth i know not lothario alone was such a one for with the utmost
care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend and strove
to diminish cut down and reduce the number of days for going to his
house according to their agreement lest the visits of a young man
wealthy high born and with the attractions he was conscious of
possessing at the house of a woman so beautiful as camilla should be
regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle
public for though his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous
tongues still he was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or
that of his friend and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he
devoted to some other business which he pretended was unavoidable so
that a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints on one side
and excuses on the other it happened however that on one occasion when
the two were strolling together outside the city anselmo addressed the
thou mayest suppose lothario my friend that i am unable to give
sufficient thanks for the favours god has rendered me in making me the
son of such parents as mine were and bestowing upon me with no niggard
hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune and
above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and camilla
for a wife two treasures that i value if not as highly as i ought at
least as highly as i am able and yet with all these good things which
are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily i am the
most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world for i know
not how long since i have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so
strange and so unusual that i wonder at myself and blame and chide
myself when i am alone and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own
thoughts and with no better success than if i were endeavouring
deliberately to publish it to all the world and as in short it must
come out i would confide it to thy safe keeping feeling sure that by
this means and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief i
shall soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me and that thy
care will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused
the words of anselmo struck lothario with astonishment unable as he was
to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble and though be
strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend
his conjectures were all far from the truth and to relieve the anxiety
which this perplexity was causing him he told him he was doing a
flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous
methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts for he well knew he
might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them or his help in carrying
that is the truth replied anselmo and relying upon that i will tell
thee friend lothario that the desire which harasses me is that of
knowing whether my wife camilla is as good and as perfect as i think her
to be and i cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by
testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her
virtue as the fire proves that of gold because i am persuaded my
friend that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not
tempted and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises
gifts tears and importunities of earnest lovers for what thanks does a
woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad and what
wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity
is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take
her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety i do not
therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in
the same estimation as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a
crown of victory and so for these reasons and many others that i could
give thee to justify and support the opinion i hold i am desirous that
my wife camilla should pass this crisis and be refined and tested by the
fire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his affections
upon her and if she comes out as i know she will victorious from this
struggle i shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled i shall be
able to say that the cup of my desire is full and that the virtuous
woman of whom the sage says who shall find her has fallen to my lot
and if the result be the contrary of what i expect in the satisfaction
of knowing that i have been right in my opinion i shall bear without
complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally
cause me and as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish
will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect it is my desire
friend lothario that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for
effecting this purpose that i am bent upon for i will afford thee
opportunities to that end and nothing shall be wanting that i may think
necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous honourable modest and
high minded woman and among other reasons i am induced to entrust this
arduous task to thee by the consideration that if camilla be conquered by
thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes but only far enough to
account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left
undone thus i shall not be wronged in anything more than intention and
my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence which i know
well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me if
therefore thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life thou wilt
at once engage in this love struggle not lukewarmly nor slothfully but
with the energy and zeal that my desire demands and with the loyalty our
such were the words anselmo addressed to lothario who listened to them
with such attention that except to say what has been already mentioned
he did not open his lips until the other had finished then perceiving
that he had no more to say after regarding him for awhile as one would
regard something never before seen that excited wonder and amazement he
said to him i cannot persuade myself anselmo my friend that what thou
hast said to me is not in jest if i thought that thou wert speaking
seriously i would not have allowed thee to go so far so as to put a stop
to thy long harangue by not listening to thee i verily suspect that
either thou dost not know me or i do not know thee but no i know well
thou art anselmo and thou knowest that i am lothario the misfortune is
it seems to me that thou art not the anselmo thou wert and must have
thought that i am not the lothario i should be for the things that thou
hast said to me are not those of that anselmo who was my friend nor are
those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the lothario thou
knowest true friends will prove their friends and make use of them as a
poet has said usque ad aras whereby he meant that they will not make
use of their friendship in things that are contrary to gods will if
this then was a heathens feeling about friendship how much more
should it be a christians who knows that the divine must not be
forfeited for the sake of any human friendship and if a friend should go
so far as to put aside his duty to heaven to fulfil his duty to his
friend it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little
moment but in such as affect the friends life and honour now tell me
anselmo in which of these two art thou imperilled that i should hazard
myself to gratify thee and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest
of me neither forsooth on the contrary thou dost ask of me so far as
i understand to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life and to
rob myself of them at the same time for if i take away thy honour it is
plain i take away thy life as a man without honour is worse than dead
and being the instrument as thou wilt have it so of so much wrong to
thee shall not i too be left without honour and consequently without
life listen to me anselmo my friend and be not impatient to answer me
until i have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire
for there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear
be it so said anselmo say what thou wilt
lothario then went on to say it seems to me anselmo that thine is
just now the temper of mind which is always that of the moors who can
never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the
holy scriptures or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the
understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith but must have
examples that are palpable easy intelligible capable of proof not
admitting of doubt with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be
denied like if equals be taken from equals the remainders are equal
and if they do not understand this in words and indeed they do not it
has to be shown to them with the hands and put before their eyes and
even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our
holy religion this same mode of proceeding i shall have to adopt with
thee for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so absurd and remote
from everything that has a semblance of reason that i feel it would be a
waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy simplicity for at
present i will call it by no other name and i am even tempted to leave
thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy pernicious desire but the
friendship i bear thee which will not allow me to desert thee in such
manifest danger of destruction keeps me from dealing so harshly by thee
and that thou mayest clearly see this say anselmo hast thou not told
me that i must force my suit upon a modest woman decoy one that is
virtuous make overtures to one that is pure minded pay court to one
that is prudent yes thou hast told me so then if thou knowest that
thou hast a wife modest virtuous pure minded and prudent what is it
that thou seekest and if thou believest that she will come forth
victorious from all my attacks as doubtless she would what higher
titles than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst upon her
then or in what will she be better then than she is now either thou
dost not hold her to be what thou sayest or thou knowest not what thou
dost demand if thou dost not hold her to be what thou why dost thou seek
to prove her instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem
best to thee but if she be as virtuous as thou believest it is an
uncalled for proceeding to make trial of truth itself for after trial
it will but be in the same estimation as before thus then it is
conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than advantage
may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds more
especially when they are things which we are not forced or compelled to
attempt and which show from afar that it is plainly madness to attempt
difficulties are attempted either for the sake of god or for the sake of
the world or for both those undertaken for gods sake are those which
the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in
human bodies those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the
men who traverse such a vast expanse of water such a variety of
climates so many strange countries to acquire what are called the
blessings of fortune and those undertaken for the sake of god and the
world together are those of brave soldiers who no sooner do they see in
the enemys wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make than
casting aside all fear without hesitating or heeding the manifest peril
that threatens them borne onward by the desire of defending their faith
their country and their king they fling themselves dauntlessly into the
midst of the thousand opposing deaths that await them such are the
things that men are wont to attempt and there is honour glory gain in
attempting them however full of difficulty and peril they may be but
that which thou sayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not
win thee the glory of god nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among
men for even if the issue he as thou wouldst have it thou wilt be no
happier richer or more honoured than thou art this moment and if it be
otherwise thou wilt be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined
for then it will avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of
the misfortune that has befallen thee it will suffice to torture and
crush thee that thou knowest it thyself and in confirmation of the truth
of what i say let me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet
luigi tansillo at the end of the first part of his tears of saint
the anguish and the shame but greater grew in peters heart as morning
slowly came no eye was there to see him well he knew yet he himself
was to himself a shame exposed to all mens gaze or screened from view
a noble heart will feel the pang the same a prey to shame the sinning
soul will be though none but heaven and earth its shame can see
thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow but rather
thou wilt shed tears unceasingly if not tears of the eyes tears of
blood from the heart like those shed by that simple doctor our poet
tells us of that tried the test of the cup which the wise rinaldo
better advised refused to do for though this may be a poetic fiction it
contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation
moreover by what i am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the
tell me anselmo if heaven or good fortune had made thee master and
lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality with the excellence and
purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied
saying with one voice and common consent that in purity quality and
fineness it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be thou
thyself too being of the same belief as knowing nothing to the contrary
would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place
it between an anvil and a hammer and by mere force of blows and strength
of arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said and if thou
didst and if the stone should resist so silly a test that would add
nothing to its value or reputation and if it were broken as it might
be would not all be lost undoubtedly it would leaving its owner to be
rated as a fool in the opinion of all consider then anselmo my friend
that camilla is a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation
as in that of others and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to
the risk of being broken for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a
higher value than she now possesses and if she give way and be unable to
resist bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her and with what
good reason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of
her ruin and thine own remember there is no jewel in the world so
precious as a chaste and virtuous woman and that the whole honour of
women consists in reputation and since thy wifes is of that high
excellence that thou knowest wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that
truth in question remember my friend that woman is an imperfect
animal and that impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her
trip and fall but that they should be removed and her path left clear
of all obstacles so that without hindrance she may run her course freely
to attain the desired perfection which consists in being virtuous
naturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur of
purest white and that when the hunters wish to take it they make use of
this artifice having ascertained the places which it frequents and
passes they stop the way to them with mud and then rousing it drive it
towards the spot and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud it halts
and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass through the mire
and spoil and sully its whiteness which it values more than life and
liberty the virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine and whiter and purer
than snow is the virtue of modesty and he who wishes her not to lose it
but to keep and preserve it must adopt a course different from that
employed with the ermine he must not put before her the mire of the
gifts and attentions of persevering lovers because perhaps and even
without a perhaps she may not have sufficient virtue and natural
strength in herself to pass through and tread under foot these
impediments they must be removed and the brightness of virtue and the
beauty of a fair fame must be put before her a virtuous woman too is
like a mirror of clear shining crystal liable to be tarnished and
dimmed by every breath that touches it she must be treated as relics
are adored not touched she must be protected and prized as one
protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and flowers the owner of
which allows no one to trespass or pluck a blossom enough for others
that from afar and through the iron grating they may enjoy its fragrance
and its beauty finally let me repeat to thee some verses that come to my
mind i heard them in a modern comedy and it seems to me they bear upon
the point we are discussing a prudent old man was giving advice to
another the father of a young girl to lock her up watch over her and
keep her in seclusion and among other arguments he used these
all that i have said to thee so far anselmo has had reference to what
concerns thee now it is right that i should say something of what
regards myself and if i be prolix pardon me for the labyrinth into
which thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate
thou dost reckon me thy friend and thou wouldst rob me of honour a
thing wholly inconsistent with friendship and not only dost thou aim at
this but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also that thou wouldst rob
me of it is clear for when camilla sees that i pay court to her as thou
requirest she will certainly regard me as a man without honour or right
feeling since i attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what i owe to
my own position and thy friendship that thou wouldst have me rob thee of
it is beyond a doubt for camilla seeing that i press my suit upon her
will suppose that i have perceived in her something light that has
encouraged me to make known to her my base desire and if she holds
herself dishonoured her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her and
hence arises what so commonly takes place that the husband of the
adulterous woman though he may not be aware of or have given any cause
for his wifes failure in her duty or being careless or negligent have
had it in his power to prevent his dishonour nevertheless is stigmatised
by a vile and reproachful name and in a manner regarded with eyes of
contempt instead of pity by all who know of his wifes guilt though they
see that he is unfortunate not by his own fault but by the lust of a
vicious consort but i will tell thee why with good reason dishonour
attaches to the husband of the unchaste wife though he know not that she
is so nor be to blame nor have done anything or given any provocation
to make her so and be not weary with listening to me for it will be for
when god created our first parent in the earthly paradise the holy
scripture says that he infused sleep into adam and while he slept took a
rib from his left side of which he formed our mother eve and when adam
