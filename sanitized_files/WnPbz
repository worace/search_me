both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess
described their last days in moscow their departure the fire and the
destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also
mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them
his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more
next day nicholas took his mothers letter and went to see princess
mary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him
might mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as
intimate with the princess as if they were relations
the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl
and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment
sonyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to
nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas
married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more she
knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and sonyas
life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially
after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting
with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip of
but a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all that
was going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching and
making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and
repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
i shall not be at peace till you promise me this
sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she
would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actual
promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of
her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and
brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was sonyas habit her
position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her
former acts of self sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they
raised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her more
worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world but
now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the
whole reward for her self sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life
and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous
of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never
needed to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for
her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt
that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was
beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or
religion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life of
dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answered
the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and
resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him
free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever
the bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled the
gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find escape from
them in practical activity but when she heard of prince andrews
presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for
natasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god
did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natasha
loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him she
knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances
they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas would
then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the
prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had
happened during those last days and during the first days of their
journey this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal
at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a
three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one
of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better
that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat the
count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was
calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery
sonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and
natasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through
the door that door opened and natasha came out looking excited not
noticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sonya and took her hand
natasha what are you about come here said the countess
natasha went up to the monk for his blessing and he advised her to pray
as soon as the prior withdrew natasha took her friend by the hand and
sonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how
unhappy sonya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he
lives he cannot because because of and natasha burst into
yes i knew it thank god murmured sonya he will live
sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and
grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one
sobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she
thought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two
friends went together to prince andrews door natasha opened it
cautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at the
prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was
calm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing
o natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching her companions
its that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lips
natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window not
yet understanding what the latter was telling her
you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression you
remember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe at
yes yes cried natasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recalling
that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen
you remember sonya went on i saw it then and told everybody you
and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture with
her hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyes
closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were
folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just
seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror
she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that
came into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now as
real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had
then said that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
something red but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed
yes yes it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she too
remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most
but what does it mean she added meditatively
oh i dont know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching at
a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him but
sonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window
thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred
they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the
sonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her
niece passed sonya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft
tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles
sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those
eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and
readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal
sonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand
sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that
day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
vision now that she knew that the renewal of natashas relations with
prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she
was joyfully conscious of a return of that self sacrificing spirit in
which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful
consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several
times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that
touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas
the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with
hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken
in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to
who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a
result of their recent personal conflict with him
but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the
new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had
been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not
recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only
no 17 of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason
by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable
about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and
thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as
surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the
other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was
all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and
recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as
he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him
that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among
them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken
with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache
sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms
with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners
and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others
was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object
these questions like questions put at trials generally left the
essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essences
being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which
the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to
the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say
anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and
the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused
always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were
put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a
kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he
knew he was in these mens power that only by force had they brought
him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to
their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to
inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him
this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was
evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was
doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was
protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted
was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was
not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where
witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was
happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked
where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they
asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer
again he replied that he could not answer it
put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the general
with the white mustache and red flushed face
on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart
pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchants
house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre
felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city
fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the
significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with
he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and
during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all
those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day
from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the
soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and
these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were
had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre
on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by
the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the
prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding
a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming
pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and
indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to
have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with
thirteen others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunny
after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low
as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the
zubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames
were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far
as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were
waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and
here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at
the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and
there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which
was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the
belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin
glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly
these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the
nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be
seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in
place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierre
unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been
established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the
soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were
escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an
important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier
whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental
music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it
especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out
when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men
and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with
the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come
back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name
and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were
now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces
that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted
and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself
to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
action he did not understand but which was working well
he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgins
field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
convent this was prince shcherbitovs house where pierre had often
been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the
soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout
they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one
pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery
an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low
study at the door of which stood an adjutant
davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of
the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting
a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes
pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him
davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his
cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster
who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every
instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to
say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first
examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and
embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do
davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead
screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him
i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently
the chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his head
you cannot know me general i have never seen you
he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general
who was present but whom pierre had not noticed
davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre
no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke
no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and
what proof have i that you are not lying
monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading
davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked
at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war
and law that look established human relations between the two men at
that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the
papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre
was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without
burdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a
how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout
pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the
you are not what you say returned davout
in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the
but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout
davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began
buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre
when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in
pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but
where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house
or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as
he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did
pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or
in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied
and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his
mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to
death not the men on the commission that had first examined him not
one of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not
davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment
davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the
adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had
evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming
in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of life him
pierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was
doing this and pierre felt that it was no one
it was a system a concurrence of circumstances
a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life of
from prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down the
virgins field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden
in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been
dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in
a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of
napoleons soldiers who were not on duty germans italians and
frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post
stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list
pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly
began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if
part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or
understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wish
that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly
pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them
the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin
the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a
domestic serf about forty five years old with grizzled hair and a
plump well nourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome
man with a broad light brown beard and black eyes the fifth was a
factory hand a thin sallow faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat
pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or
two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm
voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident
that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they
understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and
a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french
then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
officers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the
convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being
brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back
and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands
the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and
twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away
to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling
noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific
thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen
were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands
two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks
these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what
was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they
alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood
nor believed that it could be taken from them
again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the
sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment
he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who
were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding
one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what
it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his
on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers
without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that
were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all
suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through
sharpshooters of the 86th forward shouted someone the fifth
prisoner the one next to pierre was led away alone pierre did not
understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought
there only to witness the execution with ever growing horror and no
sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man
was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on
him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered
and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him
along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him
to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something
whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at
the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded
pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity
and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch
at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he
wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other
when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt
the back of his head then when they propped him against the
bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that
position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again
more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss
probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of
eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember
having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the
workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed
itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally
and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered
him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman
the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he
untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly
from the post and began pushing it into the pit
they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible
pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other
that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls
of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the
soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to
go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post
when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken
back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made
a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the twenty four
sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the
circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by
pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this
one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and
his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot
from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps
forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned
officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to
his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they
all went away silently and with drooping heads
that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen
pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who
was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not
able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a
hopeless movement with his arm and went away
after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church
toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre
got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the
field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and
battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty
different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding
who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard
what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made
no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to
questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his
replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces
and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless
from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by
men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his
life on which everything depended and which made everything appear
alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into
a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to
himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity
in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this
before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed
him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the
bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from
those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the
universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins
remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not
in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life
around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and
asking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last he
found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
well then mates that very prince who some voice at the other
end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who
sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall
pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he
closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad
especially dreadful because of its simplicity and the faces of the
murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened
his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him
beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
him every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in the
darkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man
continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw
that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it aroused
having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefully
coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing up
at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was already
unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully
removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one
another uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
fixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closed
the knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himself
comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting
and well rounded in these deft movements in the mans well ordered
arrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked at
the man without taking his eyes from him
youve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said
and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice
that pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tears
rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betray
his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones
eh lad dont fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voice
old russian peasant women employ dont fret friend suffer an hour
live for an age thats how it is my dear fellow and here we live
thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men
as well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees
with a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part of
eh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other
end of the shed so youve come you rascal she remembers now now
and the soldier pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him
returned to his place and sat down in his hands he had something
here eat a bit sir said he resuming his former respectful tone as
he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup for
pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat
well are they all right said the soldier with a smile you should
he took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into two
equal halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from the
the potatoes are grand he said once more eat some like that
pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better
oh im all right said he but why did they shoot those poor
tss tt said the little man ah what a sin what a sin he
added quickly and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that you
i didnt think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally replied
and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house
no i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and tried
where theres law theres injustice put in the little man
and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the last of
i it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow
yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of fever we
werent told anything there were some twenty of us lying there we had
and do you feel sad here pierre inquired
how can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname is
karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to
address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one
to help feeling sad moscow shes the mother of cities how can one see
all this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet dies
first thats what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly
who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as god
judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said
well and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have
abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they still
and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed
smile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put these
questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that
a wife for counsel a mother in law for welcome but theres none as
dear as ones own mother said he well and have you little ones he
again pierres negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened
never mind youre young folks yet and please god may still have some
the great thing is to live in harmony
but its all the same now pierre could not help saying
ah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or a
he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to
well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had a
well to do homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our
house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there
were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so
and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someones
copse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had been
tried flogged and sent to serve as a soldier
well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it
was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for my
sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my younger
brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife
behind we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a
soldier i come home on leave and ill tell you how it was i look and
see that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle
the women at home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the
youngest at home father he says all my children are the same to me
it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if platon hadnt
been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go called us all
to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons
michael he says come here and bow down to his feet and you young
woman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before
him do you understand he says thats how it is dear fellow fate
looks for a head but we are always judging thats not well thats
not right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and it
bulges but when youve drawn it out its empty thats how it is
and platon shifted his seat on the straw
well i think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossing
lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus
christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ have
mercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground got
up sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw thats the way
lay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a loaf he
muttered as he lay down pulling his coat over him
what prayer was that you were saying asked pierre
eh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i saying
yes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavra
well of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one must
pity the animals too eh the rascal now youve curled up and got warm
you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dog that lay at
his feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediately
sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
outside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but
inside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep but
lay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring of
platon who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had been
shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on
twenty three soldiers three officers and two officials were confined
in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for
when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vivid
and precious memory and the personification of everything russian
kindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the
first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed
platons whole figure in a french overcoat girdled with a cord a
soldiers cap and bast shoes was round his head was quite round his
back chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if ever
ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and his
platon karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories of
campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself
know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly
white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
laughed as he often did were all sound and good there was not a gray
hair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impression
of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance
his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of
innocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief
peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it was
evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say
and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
his physical strength and agility during the first days of his
imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
sickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay me
down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on getting
up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and
indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he only
had to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for some
work just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could
do everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewed
planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed
himself conversation of which he was fond and songs he did not sing
like a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birds
evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds were
always high pitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and his
having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to
have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military
and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits
a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches he would say
he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not
complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally
some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he
called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full
were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ
but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous
occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well
adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which
pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay
in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had
witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in karataevs a
character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the
soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but
most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile
joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word
or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
to himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre
understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
brought him in contact with particularly with man not any particular
man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog his
comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt
that in spite of karataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which he
unconsciously gave pierres spiritual life its due he would not have
grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in
to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary
soldier they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed him
good naturedly and sent him on errands but to pierre he always
remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded
eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth
platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began
to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude
sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him to
repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a moment
before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his
favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in
it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he
did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their
context every word and action of his was the manifestation of an
activity unknown to him which was his life but his life as he
regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as
part of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actions
flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance
exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance
when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the
rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of her
aunts efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take
her nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or
impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her duty
not only to herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but
to do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared to
set off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princess
mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son
in a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were the
huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopen
trap and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne
little nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids tikhon and a
young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her
the usual route through moscow could not be thought of and the
roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk
ryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as post horses were not
everywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazan where the french
were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous
during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and
princess marys servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
spirit she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and no
difficulties daunted her thanks to her activity and energy which
infected her fellow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end of
the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life
her love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her it filled her
whole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longer
struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she loved
and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in
words she had become convinced of it at her last interview with
nicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
rostovs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that
