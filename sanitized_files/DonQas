sharing his masters infirmity did not fail to perceive who all these
disguised figures were but he did not dare to open his lips until he saw
what came of this assault and capture of his master nor did the latter
utter a word waiting to the upshot of his mishap which was that
bringing in the cage they shut him up in it and nailed the bars so
firmly that they could not be easily burst open
they then took him on their shoulders and as they passed out of the room
an awful voice as much so as the barber not he of the pack saddle but
the other was able to make it was heard to say o knight of the rueful
countenance let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict
thee for this must needs be for the more speedy accomplishment of the
adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee the which shall be
accomplished when the raging manchegan lion and the white tobosan dove
shall be linked together having first humbled their haughty necks to the
gentle yoke of matrimony and from this marvellous union shall come forth
to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening
claws of their valiant father and this shall come to pass ere the
pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice
visited the starry signs and thou o most noble and obedient squire that
ever bore sword at side beard on face or nose to smell with be not
dismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight errantry carried away
thus before thy very eyes for soon if it so please the framer of the
universe thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt
not know thyself and the promises which thy good master has made thee
shall not prove false and i assure thee on the authority of the sage
mentironiana that thy wages shall be paid thee as thou shalt see in due
season follow then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight for it
is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of
you and as it is not permitted to me to say more god be with thee for
i return to that place i wot of and as he brought the prophecy to a
close he raised his voice to a high pitch and then lowered it to such a
soft tone that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost
don quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard for he at once
comprehended its meaning perfectly and perceived it was promised to him
that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his
beloved dulcinea del toboso from whose blessed womb should proceed the
whelps his sons to the eternal glory of la mancha and being thoroughly
and firmly persuaded of this he lifted up his voice and with a deep
sigh exclaimed oh thou whoever thou art who hast foretold me so much
good i implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter
who takes charge of my interests that he leave me not to perish in this
captivity in which they are now carrying me away ere i see fulfilled
promises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me
for let this but come to pass and i shall glory in the pains of my
prison find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me and regard
this bed whereon they stretch me not as a hard battle field but as a
soft and happy nuptial couch and touching the consolation of sancho
panza my squire i rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will not
desert me in good or evil fortune for if by his ill luck or mine it
may not happen to be in my power to give him the island i have promised
or any equivalent for it at least his wages shall not be lost for in my
will which is already made i have declared the sum that shall be paid
to him measured not by his many faithful services but by the means at
sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands for
being tied together he could not kiss one and then the apparitions
lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox cart
of the strange manner in which don quixote of la mancha was carried away
when don quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way
he said many grave histories of knights errant have i read but never
yet have i read seen or heard of their carrying off enchanted
knights errant in this fashion or at the slow pace that these lazy
sluggish animals promise for they always take them away through the air
with marvellous swiftness enveloped in a dark thick cloud or on a
chariot of fire or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the
kind but to carry me off like this on an ox cart by god it puzzles me
but perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different
course from that of those in days gone by and it may be too that as i
am a new knight in the world and the first to revive the already
forgotten calling of knight adventurers they may have newly invented
other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the
enchanted what thinkest thou of the matter sancho my son
i dont know what to think answered sancho not being as well read as
your worship in errant writings but for all that i venture to say and
swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic
catholic said don quixote father of me how can they be catholic
when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do
this and bring me to this condition and if thou wouldst prove it touch
them and feel them and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air and
by god master returned sancho i have touched them already and that
devil that goes about there so busily has firm flesh and another
property very different from what i have heard say devils have for by
all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells but this
one smells of amber half a league off sancho was here speaking of don
fernando who like a gentleman of his rank was very likely perfumed as
marvel not at that sancho my friend said don quixote for let me
tell thee devils are crafty and even if they do carry odours about with
them they themselves have no smell because they are spirits or if
they have any smell they cannot smell of anything sweet but of
something foul and fetid and the reason is that as they carry hell with
them wherever they go and can get no ease whatever from their torments
and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment it is
impossible that they can smell sweet if then this devil thou speakest
of seems to thee to smell of amber either thou art deceiving thyself or
he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil
such was the conversation that passed between master and man and don
fernando and cardenio apprehensive of sanchos making a complete
discovery of their scheme towards which he had already gone some way
resolved to hasten their departure and calling the landlord aside they
directed him to saddle rocinante and put the pack saddle on sanchos ass
which he did with great alacrity in the meantime the curate had made an
arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far
as his village he paying them so much a day cardenio hung the buckler
on one side of the bow of rocinantes saddle and the basin on the other
and by signs commanded sancho to mount his ass and take rocinantes
bridle and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their
muskets but before the cart was put in motion out came the landlady and
her daughter and maritornes to bid don quixote farewell pretending to
weep with grief at his misfortune and to them don quixote said
weep not good ladies for all these mishaps are the lot of those who
follow the profession i profess and if these reverses did not befall me
i should not esteem myself a famous knight errant for such things never
happen to knights of little renown and fame because nobody in the world
thinks about them to valiant knights they do for these are envied for
their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the
destruction of the worthy by base means nevertheless virtue is of
herself so mighty that in spite of all the magic that zoroaster its
first inventor knew she will come victorious out of every trial and
shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens forgive
me fair ladies if through inadvertence i have in aught offended you
for intentionally and wittingly i have never done so to any and pray to
god that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent
enchanter has consigned me and should i find myself released therefrom
the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in
memory by me that i may acknowledge recognise and requite them as they
while this was passing between the ladies of the castle and don quixote
the curate and the barber bade farewell to don fernando and his
companions to the captain his brother and the ladies now all made
happy and in particular to dorothea and luscinda they all embraced one
another and promised to let each other know how things went with them
and don fernando directed the curate where to write to him to tell him
what became of don quixote assuring him that there was nothing that
could give him more pleasure than to hear of it and that he too on his
part would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know
about his marriage zoraidas baptism don luiss affair and luscindas
return to her home the curate promised to comply with his request
carefully and they embraced once more and renewed their promises
the landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers saying he
had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of
the ill advised curiosity had been found and that he might take them
all away with him as their owner had not since returned for as he could
not read he did not want them himself the curate thanked him and
opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words novel
of rinconete and cortadillo by which he perceived that it was a novel
and as that of the ill advised curiosity had been good he concluded
this would be so too as they were both probably by the same author so
he kept it intending to read it when he had an opportunity he then
mounted and his friend the barber did the same both masked so as not to
be recognised by don quixote and set out following in the rear of the
cart the order of march was this first went the cart with the owner
leading it at each side of it marched the officers of the brotherhood
as has been said with their muskets then followed sancho panza on his
ass leading rocinante by the bridle and behind all came the curate and
the barber on their mighty mules with faces covered as aforesaid and a
grave and serious air measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the
oxen don quixote was seated in the cage with his hands tied and his
feet stretched out leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as
if he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh thus slowly and
silently they made it might be two leagues until they reached a valley
which the carter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his
oxen and he said so to the curate but the barber was of opinion that
they ought to push on a little farther as at the other side of a hill
which appeared close by he knew there was a valley that had more grass
and much better than the one where they proposed to halt and his advice
just at that moment the curate looking back saw coming on behind them
six or seven mounted men well found and equipped who soon overtook
them for they were travelling not at the sluggish deliberate pace of
oxen but like men who rode canons mules and in haste to take their
noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a
league off the quick travellers came up with the slow and courteous
salutations were exchanged and one of the new comers who was in fact
a canon of toledo and master of the others who accompanied him observing
the regular order of the procession the cart the officers sancho
rocinante the curate and the barber and above all don quixote caged and
confined could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man
in that fashion though from the badges of the officers he already
concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor
whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the holy brotherhood
one of the officers to whom he had put the question replied let the
gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way senor for
don quixote overheard the conversation and said haply gentlemen you
are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry because if you are
i will tell you my misfortunes if not there is no good in my giving
myself the trouble of relating them but here the curate and the barber
seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with don quixote
came forward in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem
the canon replying to don quixote said in truth brother i know more
about books of chivalry than i do about villalpandos elements of logic
so if that be all you may safely tell me what you please
in gods name then senor replied don quixote if that be so i
would have you know that i am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and
fraud of wicked enchanters for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked
than loved by the good i am a knight errant and not one of those whose
names fame has never thought of immortalising in her record but of those
who in defiance and in spite of envy itself and all the magicians that
persia or brahmans that india or gymnosophists that ethiopia ever
produced will place their names in the temple of immortality to serve
as examples and patterns for ages to come whereby knights errant may see
the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit
what senor don quixote of la mancha says observed the curate is the
truth for he goes enchanted in this cart not from any fault or sins of
his but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and
valour hateful this senor is the knight of the rueful countenance if
you have ever heard him named whose valiant achievements and mighty
deeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble
notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to
when the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty
talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment
and could not make out what had befallen him and all his attendants were
at this point sancho panza who had drawn near to hear the conversation
said in order to make everything plain well sirs you may like or
dislike what i am going to say but the fact of the matter is my master
don quixote is just as much enchanted as my mother he is in his full
senses he eats and he drinks and he has his calls like other men and as
he had yesterday before they caged him and if thats the case what do
they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted for i have heard
many a one say that enchanted people neither eat nor sleep nor talk
and my master if you dont stop him will talk more than thirty
lawyers then turning to the curate he exclaimed ah senor curate
senor curate do you think i dont know you do you think i dont guess
and see the drift of these new enchantments well then i can tell you i
know you for all your face is covered and i can tell you i am up to
you however you may hide your tricks after all where envy reigns
virtue cannot live and where there is niggardliness there can be no
liberality ill betide the devil if it had not been for your worship my
master would be married to the princess micomicona this minute and i
should be a count at least for no less was to be expected as well from
the goodness of my master him of the rueful countenance as from the
greatness of my services but i see now how true it is what they say in
these parts that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill wheel
and that those who were up yesterday are down to day i am sorry for my
wife and children for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to
see their father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or
kingdom they will see him come back a horse boy i have said all this
senor curate only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your
ill treatment of my master and have a care that god does not call you to
account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way and
charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord don
quixote leaves undone while he is shut up
trim those lamps there exclaimed the barber at this so you are of
the same fraternity as your master too sancho by god i begin to see
that you will have to keep him company in the cage and be enchanted like
him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry it was an evil
hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises and that
island you long so much for found its way into your head
i am not with child by anyone returned sancho nor am i a man to let
myself be got with child if it was by the king himself though i am poor
i am an old christian and i owe nothing to nobody and if i long for an
island other people long for worse each of us is the son of his own
works and being a man i may come to be pope not to say governor of an
island especially as my master may win so many that he will not know
whom to give them to mind how you talk master barber for shaving is
not everything and there is some difference between peter and peter i
say this because we all know one another and it will not do to throw
false dice with me and as to the enchantment of my master god knows the
truth leave it as it is it only makes it worse to stir it
the barber did not care to answer sancho lest by his plain speaking he
should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to
conceal and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon
to ride on a little in advance so that he might tell him the mystery of
this man in the cage and other things that would amuse him the canon
agreed and going on ahead with his servants listened with attention to
the account of the character life madness and ways of don quixote
given him by the curate who described to him briefly the beginning and
origin of his craze and told him the whole story of his adventures up to
his being confined in the cage together with the plan they had of taking
him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his
madness the canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard
don quixotes strange story and when it was finished he said to tell
the truth senor curate i for my part consider what they call books of
chivalry to be mischievous to the state and though led by idle and
false taste i have read the beginnings of almost all that have been
printed i never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to
end for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing and one
has nothing more in it than another this no more than that and in my
opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as
the fables they call the milesian nonsensical tales that aim solely at
giving amusement and not instruction exactly the opposite of the
apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time and though it
may be the chief object of such books to amuse i do not know how they
can succeed when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense for the
enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it
perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination
brings before it and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion
about it can give any pleasure what beauty then or what proportion of
the parts to the whole or of the whole to the parts can there be in a
book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower
and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake and when they
want to give us a picture of a battle after having told us that there
are a million of combatants on the side of the enemy let the hero of the
book be opposed to them and we have perforce to believe whether we like
it or not that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of
his strong arm and then what shall we say of the facility with which a
born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some
unknown wandering knight what mind that is not wholly barbarous and
uncultured can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of
knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind and will
be to night in lombardy and to morrow morning in the land of prester john
of the indies or some other that ptolemy never described nor marco polo
saw and if in answer to this i am told that the authors of books of
the kind write them as fiction and therefore are not bound to regard
niceties of truth i would reply that fiction is all the better the more
it looks like truth and gives the more pleasure the more probability and
possibility there is about it plots in fiction should be wedded to the
understanding of the reader and be constructed in such a way that
mind on the alert they may surprise interest divert and entertain so
that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other all
which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to
nature wherein lies the perfection of writing i have never yet seen any
book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its
numbers so that the middle agrees with the beginning and the end with
the beginning and middle on the contrary they construct them with such
a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a
chimera or monster rather than a well proportioned figure and besides
all this they are harsh in their style incredible in their achievements
licentious in their amours uncouth in their courtly speeches prolix in
their battles silly in their arguments absurd in their travels and in
short wanting in everything like intelligent art for which reason they
deserve to be banished from the christian commonwealth as a worthless
the curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of
sound understanding and that there was good reason in what he said so
he told him that being of the same opinion himself and bearing a grudge
to books of chivalry he had burned all don quixotes which were many
and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them and of those
he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared with which the
canon was not a little amused adding that though he had said so much in
condemnation of these books still he found one good thing in them and
that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for
displaying itself for they presented a wide and spacious field over
which the pen might range freely describing shipwrecks tempests
combats battles portraying a valiant captain with all the
qualifications requisite to make one showing him sagacious in foreseeing
the wiles of the enemy eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his
soldiers ripe in counsel rapid in resolve as bold in biding his time
as in pressing the attack now picturing some sad tragic incident now
some joyful and unexpected event here a beauteous lady virtuous wise
and modest there a christian knight brave and gentle here a lawless
barbarous braggart there a courteous prince gallant and gracious
setting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals the greatness and
generosity of nobles or again said he the author may show himself
to be an astronomer or a skilled cosmographer or musician or one
versed in affairs of state and sometimes he will have a chance of coming
forward as a magician if he likes he can set forth the craftiness of
ulysses the piety of aeneas the valour of achilles the misfortunes of
hector the treachery of sinon the friendship of euryalus the
generosity of alexander the boldness of caesar the clemency and truth
of trajan the fidelity of zopyrus the wisdom of cato and in short all
the faculties that serve to make an illustrious man perfect now uniting
them in one individual again distributing them among many and if this
be done with charm of style and ingenious invention aiming at the truth
as much as possible he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied
threads that when finished will display such perfection and beauty that
it will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek which as i
said before is to give instruction and pleasure combined for the
unrestricted range of these books enables the author to show his powers
epic lyric tragic or comic and all the moods the sweet and winning
arts of poesy and oratory are capable of for the epic may be written in
in which the canon pursues the subject of the books of chivalry with
it is as you say senor canon said the curate and for that reason
those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more
censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the
rules of art by which they might guide themselves and become as famous
in prose as the two princes of greek and latin poetry are in verse
i myself at any rate said the canon was once tempted to write a
book of chivalry in which all the points i have mentioned were to be
observed and if i must own the truth i have more than a hundred sheets
written and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it i showed them
to persons who were fond of this kind of reading to learned and
intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but
the pleasure of listening to nonsense and from all i obtained flattering
approval nevertheless i proceeded no farther with it as well because it
seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession as because i
perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise and though it
is better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish
many i have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly
public to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part
but what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of
finishing it was an argument i put to myself taken from the plays that
are acted now a days which was in this wise if those that are now in
vogue as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history
are all or most of them downright nonsense and things that have neither
head nor tail and yet the public listens to them with delight and
regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it and
if the authors who write them and the players who act them say that
this is what they must be for the public wants this and will have
nothing else and that those that go by rule and work out a plot
according to the laws of art will only find some half dozen intelligent
people to understand them while all the rest remain blind to the merit
of their composition and that for themselves it is better to get bread
from the many than praise from the few then my book will fare the same
way after i have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the
principles i have spoken of and i shall be the tailor of the corner
and though i have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are
mistaken in this notion they have adopted and that they would attract
more people and get more credit by producing plays in accordance with
the rules of art than by absurd ones they are so thoroughly wedded to
their own opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it
i remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows tell me
do you not recollect that a few years ago there were three tragedies
acted in spain written by a famous poet of these kingdoms which were
such that they filled all who heard them with admiration delight and
interest the ignorant as well as the wise the masses as well as the
higher orders and brought in more money to the performers these three
alone than thirty of the best that have been since produced
no doubt replied the actor in question you mean the isabella the
those are the ones i mean said i and see if they did not observe
the principles of art and if by observing them they failed to show
their superiority and please all the world so that the fault does not
lie with the public that insists upon nonsense but with those who dont
know how to produce something else the ingratitude revenged was not
nonsense nor was there any in the numantia nor any to be found in
the merchant lover nor yet in the friendly fair foe nor in some
others that have been written by certain gifted poets to their own fame
and renown and to the profit of those that brought them out some
further remarks i added to these with which i think i left him rather
dumbfoundered but not so satisfied or convinced that i could disabuse
you have touched upon a subject senor canon observed the curate here
that has awakened an old enmity i have against the plays in vogue at the
present day quite as strong as that which i bear to the books of
chivalry for while the drama according to tully should be the mirror
of human life the model of manners and the image of the truth those
which are presented now a days are mirrors of nonsense models of folly
and images of lewdness for what greater nonsense can there be in
connection with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear
in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first act and in the
second a grown up bearded man or what greater absurdity can there be
than putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler a young man as a
poltroon a lackey using fine language a page giving sage advice a king
plying as a porter a princess who is a kitchen maid and then what shall
i say of their attention to the time in which the action they represent
may or can take place save that i have seen a play where the first act
began in europe the second in asia the third finished in africa and no
doubt had it been in four acts the fourth would have ended in america
and so it would have been laid in all four quarters of the globe and if
truth to life is the main thing the drama should keep in view how is it
possible for any average understanding to be satisfied when the action is
supposed to pass in the time of king pepin or charlemagne and the
principal personage in it they represent to be the emperor heraclius who
entered jerusalem with the cross and won the holy sepulchre like godfrey
of bouillon there being years innumerable between the one and the other
or if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced
or bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed
up with it all not only without any semblance of probability but with
obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable and the
worst of it is there are ignorant people who say that this is
perfection and that anything beyond this is affected refinement and
then if we turn to sacred dramas what miracles they invent in them what
apocryphal ill devised incidents attributing to one saint the miracles
of another and even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles
without any reason or object except that they think some such miracle or
transformation as they call it will come in well to astonish stupid
people and draw them to the play all this tends to the prejudice of the
truth and the corruption of history nay more to the reproach of the
wits of spain for foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the
drama look upon us as barbarous and ignorant when they see the absurdity
and nonsense of the plays we produce nor will it be a sufficient excuse
to say that the chief object well ordered governments have in view when
they permit plays to be performed in public is to entertain the people
with some harmless amusement occasionally and keep it from those evil
humours which idleness is apt to engender and that as this may be
attained by any sort of play good or bad there is no need to lay down
laws or bind those who write or act them to make them as they ought to
be made since as i say the object sought for may be secured by any
sort to this i would reply that the same end would be beyond all
comparison better attained by means of good plays than by those that are
not so for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play
the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests instructed by the
serious parts full of admiration at the incidents his wits sharpened by
the arguments warned by the tricks all the wiser for the examples
inflamed against vice and in love with virtue for in all these ways a
good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or
dull and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with
all these qualities will not entertain satisfy and please much more
than one wanting in them like the greater number of those which are
commonly acted now a days nor are the poets who write them to be blamed
for this for some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of
their faults and know what they ought to do but as plays have become a
salable commodity they say and with truth that the actors will not buy
them unless they are after this fashion and so the poet tries to adapt
himself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work
and that this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most
fertile wit of these kingdoms has written with so much brilliancy so
much grace and gaiety such polished versification such choice language
such profound reflections and in a word so rich in eloquence and
elevation of style that he has filled the world with his fame and yet
in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors they have
not all as some of them have come as near perfection as they ought
others write plays with such heedlessness that after they have been
acted the actors have to fly and abscond afraid of being punished as
they often have been for having acted something offensive to some king
or other or insulting to some noble family all which evils and many
more that i say nothing of would be removed if there were some
intelligent and sensible person at the capital to examine all plays
before they were acted not only those produced in the capital itself
but all that were intended to be acted in spain without whose approval
seal and signature no local magistracy should allow any play to be
acted in that case actors would take care to send their plays to the
capital and could act them in safety and those who write them would be
more careful and take more pains with their work standing in awe of
having to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the
matter and so good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at
happily attained as well the amusement of the people as the credit of
the wits of spain the interest and safety of the actors and the saving
of trouble in inflicting punishment on them and if the same or some
other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of
chivalry no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have
described enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure
of eloquence and driving the old books into obscurity before the light
of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment not
merely of the idle but of the very busiest for the bow cannot be always
bent nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful amusement
the canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation
when the barber coming forward joined them and said to the curate
this is the spot senor licentiate that i said was a good one for fresh
and plentiful pasture for the oxen while we take our noontide rest
and so it seems returned the curate and he told the canon what he
proposed to do on which he too made up his mind to halt with them
attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes
and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate to whom he had
begun to take a fancy and also to learn more particulars about the
doings of don quixote he desired some of his servants to go on to the
inn which was not far distant and fetch from it what eatables there
might be for the whole party as he meant to rest for the afternoon where
he was to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule which
by this time ought to have reached the inn carried provisions enough to
make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley
in that case said the canon take all the beasts there and bring the
while this was going on sancho perceiving that he could speak to his
master without having the curate and the barber of whom he had his
suspicions present all the time approached the cage in which don
quixote was placed and said senor to ease my conscience i want to
tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment and that is that
these two here with their faces covered are the curate of our village
and the barber and i suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying
you off in this fashion out of pure envy because your worship surpasses
them in doing famous deeds and if this be the truth it follows that you
are not enchanted but hoodwinked and made a fool of and to prove this i
want to ask you one thing and if you answer me as i believe you will
answer you will be able to lay your finger on the trick and you will
see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits
ask what thou wilt sancho my son returned don quixote for i will
satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest as to what thou sayest that
these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber our
neighbours and acquaintances it is very possible that they may seem to
be those same persons but that they are so in reality and in fact
believe it not on any account what thou art to believe and think is
that if they look like them as thou sayest it must be that those who
have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness for it is easy for
enchanters to take any form they please and they may have taken those of
our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost and lead thee into
a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou
hadst the cord of theseus and they may also have done it to make me
uncertain in my mind and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to
me for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate
of our village are here in company with us and on the other i find
myself shut up in a cage and know in my heart that no power on earth
that was not supernatural would have been able to shut me in what
wouldst thou have me say or think but that my enchantment is of a sort
that transcends all i have ever read of in all the histories that deal
with knights errant that have been enchanted so thou mayest set thy mind
at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest for they are as
much so as i am a turk but touching thy desire to ask me something say
on and i will answer thee though thou shouldst ask questions from this
may our lady be good to me said sancho lifting up his voice and is
it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains
that you cannot see that what i say is the simple truth and that malice
has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment
but as it is so i will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted
now tell me so may god deliver you from this affliction and so may you
find yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady dulcinea 
leave off conjuring me said don quixote and ask what thou wouldst
know i have already told thee i will answer with all possible
that is what i want said sancho and what i would know and have you
tell me without adding or leaving out anything but telling the whole
truth as one expects it to be told and as it is told by all who profess
arms as your worship professes them under the title of knights errant 
i tell thee i will not lie in any particular said don quixote finish
thy question for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations
well i rely on the goodness and truth of my master said sancho and
so because it bears upon what we are talking about i would ask
speaking with all reverence whether since your worship has been shut up
and as you think enchanted in this cage you have felt any desire or
inclination to go anywhere as the saying is
i do not understand going anywhere said don quixote explain
thyself more clearly sancho if thou wouldst have me give an answer to
is it possible said sancho that your worship does not understand
going anywhere why the schoolboys know that from the time they were
babes well then you must know i mean have you had any desire to do what
ah now i understand thee sancho said don quixote yes often and
even this minute get me out of this strait or all will not go right
which treats of the shrewd conversation which sancho panza held with his
aha i have caught you said sancho this is what in my heart and soul
i was longing to know come now senor can you deny what is commonly
said around us when a person is out of humour i dont know what ails
so and so that he neither eats nor drinks nor sleeps nor gives a
proper answer to any question one would think he was enchanted from
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat or drink or sleep
or do any of the natural acts i am speaking of that such persons are
enchanted but not those that have the desire your worship has and drink
when drink is given them and eat when there is anything to eat and
what thou sayest is true sancho replied don quixote but i have
already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments and it may be
that in the course of time they have been changed one for another and
that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that i do
though they did not do so before so it is vain to argue or draw
inferences against the usage of the time i know and feel that i am
enchanted and that is enough to ease my conscience for it would weigh
heavily on it if i thought that i was not enchanted and that in a
faint hearted and cowardly way i allowed myself to lie in this cage
defrauding multitudes of the succour i might afford to those in need and
distress who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and
still for all that replied sancho i say that for your greater and
fuller satisfaction it would be well if your worship were to try to get
out of this prison and i promise to do all in my power to help and even
to take you out of it and see if you could once more mount your good
rocinante who seems to be enchanted too he is so melancholy and
dejected and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures
again and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the
cage in which on the faith of a good and loyal squire i promise to
shut myself up along with your worship if so be you are so unfortunate
or i so stupid as not to be able to carry out my plan
i am content to do as thou sayest brother sancho said don quixote
and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release i will obey
thee absolutely but thou wilt see sancho how mistaken thou art in thy
the knight errant and the ill errant squire kept up their conversation
till they reached the place where the curate the canon and the barber
who had already dismounted were waiting for them the carter at once
unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green
spot the freshness of which seemed to invite not enchanted people like
don quixote but wide awake sensible folk like his squire who begged
the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little for if
they did not let him out the prison might not be as clean as the
propriety of such a gentleman as his master required the curate
understood him and said he would very gladly comply with his request
only that he feared his master finding himself at liberty would take to
his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again
i will answer for his not running away said sancho
and i also said the canon especially if he gives me his word as a
knight not to leave us without our consent
don quixote who was listening to all this said i give it moreover
one who is enchanted as i am cannot do as he likes with himself for he
who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three
ages and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying and
that being so they might as well release him particularly as it would
be to the advantage of all for if they did not let him out he
protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless
the canon took his hand tied together as they both were and on his word
and promise they unbound him and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find
himself out of the cage the first thing he did was to stretch himself
all over and then he went to where rocinante was standing and giving him
a couple of slaps on the haunches said i still trust in god and in his
blessed mother o flower and mirror of steeds that we shall soon see
ourselves both of us as we wish to be thou with thy master on thy
back and i mounted upon thee following the calling for which god sent
me into the world and so saying accompanied by sancho he withdrew to
a retired spot from which he came back much relieved and more eager than
ever to put his squires scheme into execution
the canon gazed at him wondering at the extraordinary nature of his
madness and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such
excellent sense and only lose his stirrups as has been already said
when the subject of chivalry was broached and so moved by compassion
he said to him as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival
is it possible gentle sir that the nauseous and idle reading of books
of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your
reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted and the like all as far
from the truth as falsehood itself is how can there be any human
understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity
of amadises in the world or all that multitude of famous knights all
those emperors of trebizond all those felixmartes of hircania all those
palfreys and damsels errant and serpents and monsters and giants and
marvellous adventures and enchantments of every kind and battles and
prodigious encounters splendid costumes love sick princesses squires
made counts droll dwarfs love letters billings and cooings
swashbuckler women and in a word all that nonsense the books of
chivalry contain for myself i can only say that when i read them so
long as i do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity they
give me a certain amount of pleasure but when i come to consider what
they are i fling the very best of them at the wall and would fling it
into the fire if there were one at hand as richly deserving such
punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary
toleration and as founders of new sects and modes of life and teachers
that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the
folly they contain and such is their audacity they even dare to
unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence as is shown
plainly by the way they have served your worship when they have brought
you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on
an ox cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to
make money by showing it come senor don quixote have some compassion
for yourself return to the bosom of common sense and make use of the
liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you
employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may
serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour and if still
led away by your natural bent you desire to read books of achievements
and of chivalry read the book of judges in the holy scriptures for
there you will find grand reality and deeds as true as they are heroic
lusitania had a viriatus rome a caesar carthage a hannibal greece an
alexander castile a count fernan gonzalez valencia a cid andalusia a
gonzalo fernandez estremadura a diego garcia de paredes jerez a garci
perez de vargas toledo a garcilaso seville a don manuel de leon to
read of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest
minds and fill them with delight and wonder here senor don quixote
will be reading worthy of your sound understanding from which you will
rise learned in history in love with virtue strengthened in goodness
improved in manners brave without rashness prudent without cowardice
and all to the honour of god your own advantage and the glory of la
mancha whence i am informed your worship derives your birth
don quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canons words
and when he found he had finished after regarding him for some time he
it appears to me gentle sir that your worships discourse is intended
to persuade me that there never were any knights errant in the world and
that all the books of chivalry are false lying mischievous and useless
to the state and that i have done wrong in reading them and worse in
believing them and still worse in imitating them when i undertook to
follow the arduous calling of knight errantry which they set forth for
you deny that there ever were amadises of gaul or of greece or any other
of the knights of whom the books are full
it is all exactly as you state it said the canon to which don quixote
returned you also went on to say that books of this kind had done me
much harm inasmuch as they had upset my senses and shut me up in a
cage and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies
and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and
well then returned don quixote to my mind it is you who are the one
that is out of his wits and enchanted as you have ventured to utter such
blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as
true that whoever denies it as you do deserves the same punishment
which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read
them for to try to persuade anybody that amadis and all the other
knights adventurers with whom the books are filled never existed would
be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light or ice
cold or earth nourishment what wit in the world can persuade another
that the story of the princess floripes and guy of burgundy is not true
or that of fierabras and the bridge of mantible which happened in the
time of charlemagne for by all that is good it is as true as that it is
daylight now and if it be a lie it must be a lie too that there was a
hector or achilles or trojan war or twelve peers of france or arthur
of england who still lives changed into a raven and is unceasingly
looked for in his kingdom one might just as well try to make out that
the history of guarino mezquino or of the quest of the holy grail is
false or that the loves of tristram and the queen yseult are apocryphal
as well as those of guinevere and lancelot when there are persons who
can almost remember having seen the dame quintanona who was the best
cupbearer in great britain and so true is this that i recollect a
grandmother of mine on the fathers side whenever she saw any dame in a
venerable hood used to say to me grandson that one is like dame
quintanona from which i conclude that she must have known her or at
least had managed to see some portrait of her then who can deny that the
story of pierres and the fair magalona is true when even to this day may
be seen in the kings armoury the pin with which the valiant pierres
guided the wooden horse he rode through the air and it is a trifle
bigger than the pole of a cart and alongside of the pin is babiecas
saddle and at roncesvalles there is rolands horn as large as a large
beam whence we may infer that there were twelve peers and a pierres
and a cid and other knights like them of the sort people commonly call
adventurers or perhaps i shall be told too that there was no such
knight errant as the valiant lusitanian juan de merlo who went to
burgundy and in the city of arras fought with the famous lord of charny
mosen pierres by name and afterwards in the city of basle with mosen
enrique de remesten coming out of both encounters covered with fame and
honour or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered also in
burgundy by the valiant spaniards pedro barba and gutierre quixada of
whose family i come in the direct male line when they vanquished the
sons of the count of san polo i shall be told too that don fernando de
guevara did not go in quest of adventures to germany where he engaged in
combat with micer george a knight of the house of the duke of austria i
shall be told that the jousts of suero de quinones him of the paso
and the emprise of mosen luis de falces against the castilian knight don
gonzalo de guzman were mere mockeries as well as many other
achievements of christian knights of these and foreign realms which are
so authentic and true that i repeat he who denies them must be totally
the canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction don quixote
uttered and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating
or belonging to the achievements of his knight errantry so he said in
i cannot deny senor don quixote that there is some truth in what you
say especially as regards the spanish knights errant and i am willing
to grant too that the twelve peers of france existed but i am not
disposed to believe that they did all the things that the archbishop
turpin relates of them for the truth of the matter is they were knights
chosen by the kings of france and called peers because they were all
equal in worth rank and prowess at least if they were not they ought to
have been and it was a kind of religious order like those of santiago
and calatrava in the present day in which it is assumed that those who
take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth and just as we
say now a knight of st john or of alcantara they used to say then a
knight of the twelve peers because twelve equals were chosen for that
military order that there was a cid as well as a bernardo del carpio
there can be no doubt but that they did the deeds people say they did i
hold to be very doubtful in that other matter of the pin of count
pierres that you speak of and say is near babiecas saddle in the
armoury i confess my sin for i am either so stupid or so short sighted
that though i have seen the saddle i have never been able to see the
pin in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is
for all that it is there without any manner of doubt said don
quixote and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of
all that may be replied the canon but by the orders i have
received i do not remember seeing it however granting it is there
that is no reason why i am bound to believe the stories of all those
amadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about nor is
it reasonable that a man like your worship so worthy and with so many
good qualities and endowed with such a good understanding should allow
himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in
those absurd books of chivalry are really true
of the shrewd controversy which don quixote and the canon held together
a good joke that returned don quixote books that have been printed
with the kings licence and with the approbation of those to whom they
have been submitted and read with universal delight and extolled by
great and small rich and poor learned and ignorant gentle and simple
in a word by people of every sort of whatever rank or condition they may
be that these should be lies and above all when they carry such an
appearance of truth with them for they tell us the father mother
country kindred age place and the achievements step by step and day
by day performed by such a knight or knights hush sir utter not such
blasphemy trust me i am advising you now to act as a sensible man
should only read them and you will see the pleasure you will derive
from them for come tell me can there be anything more delightful than
to see as it were here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling
pitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards and ferocious and
terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it while from the
middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying knight
whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake if thou wouldst win the
prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves prove the valour of thy
stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters
else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the
seven castles of the seven fays that lie beneath this black expanse and
then the knight almost ere the awful voice has ceased without stopping
to consider without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is
exposing himself without even relieving himself of the weight of his
massive armour commending himself to god and to his lady plunges into
the midst of the boiling lake and when he little looks for it or knows
what his fate is to be he finds himself among flowery meadows with
which the elysian fields are not to be compared
the sky seems more transparent there and the sun shines with a strange
brilliancy and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself
to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure while the ear is
soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay
plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches here he sees
a brook whose limpid waters like liquid crystal ripple over fine sands
and white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls there he
perceives a cunningly wrought fountain of many coloured jasper and
polished marble here another of rustic fashion where the little
mussel shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail
disposed in studious disorder mingled with fragments of glittering
crystal and mock emeralds make up a work of varied aspect where art
suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous
palace with walls of massy gold turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth
in short so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of
which it is built are nothing less than diamonds carbuncles rubies
pearls gold and emeralds the workmanship is still more rare and after
having seen all this what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of
damsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous
attire such that were i to set myself now to depict it as the histories
describe it to us i should never have done and then how she who seems
to be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the
boiling lake by the hand and without addressing a word to him leads him
into the rich palace or castle and strips him as naked as when his
mother bore him and bathes him in lukewarm water and anoints him all
over with sweet smelling unguents and clothes him in a shirt of the
softest sendal all scented and perfumed while another damsel comes and
throws over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very
least a city and even more how charming it is then when they tell us
how after all this they lead him to another chamber where he finds the
tables set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder
to see how they pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and
sweet scented flowers how they seat him on an ivory chair to see how
the damsels wait on him all in profound silence how they bring him such
a variety of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a
loss which to select to hear the music that resounds while he is at
table by whom or whence produced he knows not and then when the repast
is over and the tables removed for the knight to recline in the chair
picking his teeth perhaps as usual and a damsel much lovelier than any
