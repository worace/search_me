me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart she was an
orphan without either father or mother she needed me that is why i
began to love her children are so weak that the first comer even a man
like me can become their protector i have fulfilled this duty towards
cosette i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good
action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it
register this attenuating circumstance to day cosette passes out of my
life our two roads part henceforth i can do nothing for her she is
madame pontmercy her providence has changed and cosette gains by the
change all is well as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not
mention them to me but i forestall your thought they are a deposit
how did that deposit come into my hands what does that matter i
restore the deposit nothing more can be demanded of me i complete
the restitution by announcing my true name that concerns me i have a
reason for desiring that you should know who i am
and jean valjean looked marius full in the face
all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent certain gusts
of destiny produce these billows in our souls
we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us
is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are
not always precisely those which should be said there are sudden
revelations which one cannot bear and which intoxicate like baleful
wine marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself
to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was
but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this who forces you to
do so you could have kept your secret to yourself you are neither
denounced nor tracked nor pursued you have a reason for wantonly
making such a revelation conclude there is something more in what
connection do you make this confession what is your motive
my motive replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one
would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius
from what motive in fact has this convict just said i am a convict
well yes the motive is strange it is out of honesty stay the
unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me
fast it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly
solid all life falls in ruin around one one resists had i been able
to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to
go far away i should have been safe i had only to go away there are
diligences in the rue bouloy you are happy i am going i have tried
to break that thread i have jerked at it it would not break i tore my
heart with it then i said i cannot live anywhere else than here i
must stay well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply
remain here you offer me a chamber in this house madame pontmercy is
sincerely attached to me she said to the arm chair stretch out your
arms to him your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i
suit him we shall live together and take our meals in common i shall
give cosette my arm    madame pontmercy excuse me it is a habit we
shall have but one roof one table one fire the same chimney corner
in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness
that is everything we shall live as one family one family
at that word jean valjean became wild he folded his arms glared at
the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss
therein and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones
as one family no i belong to no family i do not belong to yours
i do not belong to any family of men in houses where people are among
themselves i am superfluous there are families but there is nothing
of the sort for me i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside did i
have a father and mother i almost doubt it on the day when i gave that
child in marriage all came to an end i have seen her happy and that
she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old
man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it
was well i said to myself enter thou not i could have lied it is
true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fauchelevent so long
as it was for her i could lie but now it would be for myself and i
must not it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all
would go on you ask me what has forced me to speak a very odd thing
my conscience to hold my peace was very easy however i passed the
night in trying to persuade myself to it you questioned me and what i
have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do
it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself
and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could but there
are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread
that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here by the heart or in
silencing some one who speaks softly to me when i am alone that is why
i have come hither to tell you everything this morning everything or
nearly everything it is useless to tell you that which concerns only
myself i keep that to myself you know the essential points so i have
taken my mystery and have brought it to you and i have disembowelled my
secret before your eyes it was not a resolution that was easy to take
i struggled all night long ah you think that i did not tell myself
that this was no champmathieu affair that by concealing my name i was
doing no one any injury that the name of fauchelevent had been given to
me by fauchelevent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to
him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in
that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any ones way
that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have
cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her
each one of us would have had his share of happiness if i continued to
be monsieur fauchelevent that would arrange everything yes with the
exception of my soul there was joy everywhere upon my surface but the
bottom of my soul remained black it is not enough to be happy one must
be content thus i should have remained monsieur fauchelevent thus
i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your
expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full
noonday i should have had shadows thus without crying ware i
should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should
have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who
i was you would drive me from it i should have allowed myself to
be served by domestics who had they known would have said how
horrible i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a
right to dislike i should have filched your clasps of the hand there
would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable
white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when
all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest
when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a
stranger would have been present i should have been side by side with
you in your existence having for my only care not to disarrange the
cover of my dreadful pit thus i a dead man should have thrust myself
upon you who are living beings i should have condemned her to myself
forever you and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in
the green cap does it not make you shudder i am only the most crushed
of men i should have been the most monstrous of men and i should have
committed that crime every day and i should have had that face of night
upon my visage every day every day and i should have communicated to
you a share in my taint every day every day to you my dearly beloved
my children to you my innocent creatures is it nothing to hold ones
peace is it a simple matter to keep silence no it is not simple
there is a silence which lies and my lie and my fraud and my
indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have
drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it
again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at
midday and my good morning would have lied and my good night would
have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with
my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should
have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned
soul and i should have been an abominable villain why should i do
it in order to be happy in order to be happy have i the right to be
jean valjean paused marius listened such chains of ideas and of
anguishes cannot be interrupted jean valjean lowered his voice once
more but it was no longer a dull voice it was a sinister voice
you ask why i speak i am neither denounced nor pursued nor tracked
you say yes i am denounced yes i am tracked by whom by myself
it is i who bar the passage to myself and i drag myself and i push
myself and i arrest myself and i execute myself and when one holds
and seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and
do you see that fist he continued dont you think that it holds
that collar in such a wise as not to release it well conscience
is another grasp if one desires to be happy sir one must never
understand duty for as soon as one has comprehended it it is
implacable one would say that it punished you for comprehending it
but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god
beside you one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at
monsieur pontmercy this is not common sense i am an honest man it is
by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own this
has happened to me once before but it was less painful then it was
a mere nothing yes an honest man i should not be so if through my
fault you had continued to esteem me now that you despise me i am so
i have that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have
anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliates me
and crushes me inwardly and in order that i may respect myself it is
necessary that i should be despised then i straighten up again i am
a galley slave who obeys his conscience i know well that that is most
improbable but what would you have me do about it it is the fact
i have entered into engagements with myself i keep them there are
encounters which bind us there are chances which involve us in duties
you see monsieur pontmercy various things have happened to me in the
again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as
though his words had a bitter after taste and then he went on
when one has such a horror hanging over one one has not the right to
make others share it without their knowledge one has not the right to
make them slip over ones own precipice without their perceiving it
one has not the right to let ones red blouse drag upon them one has no
right to slyly encumber with ones misery the happiness of others it is
hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch them in the dark
with ones ulcer in spite of the fact that fauchelevent lent me his
name i have no right to use it he could give it to me but i could not
take it a name is an i you see sir that i have thought somewhat i
have read a little although i am a peasant and you see that i
express myself properly i understand things i have procured myself an
education well yes to abstract a name and to place oneself under it
is dishonest letters of the alphabet can be filched like a purse or a
watch to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false
key to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock never
more to look straightforward to forever eye askance to be infamous
within the i no no no no no it is better to suffer to bleed to
weep to tear ones skin from the flesh with ones nails to pass nights
writhing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul that is why i have
just told you all this wantonly as you say
he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word
in days gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live to day in
order to live i will not steal a name
to live interrupted marius you do not need that name in order to
ah i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering
a silence ensued both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of
thoughts marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his
mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back jean valjean was
pacing to and fro he paused before a mirror and remained motionless
then as though replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as
he gazed at the mirror which he did not see
he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the
drawing room at the moment when he turned round he perceived that
marius was watching his walk then he said with an inexpressible
i drag my leg a little now you understand why
and now sir imagine this i have said nothing i have remained
monsieur fauchelevent i have taken my place in your house i am one of
you i am in my chamber i come to breakfast in the morning in slippers
in the evening all three of us go to the play i accompany madame
pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale we are together
you think me your equal one fine day you are there and i am there we
are conversing we are laughing all at once you hear a voice shouting
this name jean valjean and behold that terrible hand the police
darts from the darkness and abruptly tears off my mask
again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder jean
you see that i am right in not holding my peace be happy be
in heaven be the angel of an angel exist in the sun be content
therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor
damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth
you have before you sir a wretched man
marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean
but marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not
offered jean valjean let him have his own way and it seemed to marius
my grandfather has friends said marius i will procure your pardon
it is useless replied jean valjean i am believed to be dead and
that suffices the dead are not subjected to surveillance they are
supposed to rot in peace death is the same thing as pardon
and disengaging the hand which marius held he added with a sort of
moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty
and i need but one pardon that of my conscience
at that moment a door at the other end of the drawing room opened
gently half way and in the opening cosettes head appeared they saw
only her sweet face her hair was in charming disorder her eyelids were
still swollen with sleep she made the movement of a bird which thrusts
its head out of its nest glanced first at her husband then at jean
valjean and cried to them with a smile so that they seemed to behold a
i will wager that you are talking politics how stupid that is instead
and he paused one would have said that they were two criminals
cosette who was radiant continued to gaze at both of them there was
something in her eyes like gleams of paradise
i have caught you in the very act said cosette just now i heard my
father fauchelevent through the door saying conscience    doing my
duty    that is politics indeed it is i will not have it people
should not talk politics the very next day it is not right
you are mistaken cosette said marius we are talking business we
are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand
that is not it at all interrupted cosette i am coming does any
and passing resolutely through the door she entered the drawing room
she was dressed in a voluminous white dressing gown with a thousand
folds and large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet
in the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures there are these
she contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror then
there was once a king and a queen oh how happy i am
that said she made a curtsey to marius and to jean valjean
there said she i am going to install myself near you in an
easy chair we breakfast in half an hour you shall say anything you
like i know well that men must talk and i will be very good
marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her
by the way said cosette i have opened my window a flock of
pierrots has arrived in the garden birds not maskers to day is
i tell you that we are talking business go my little cosette leave
us alone for a moment we are talking figures that will bore you
you have a charming cravat on this morning marius you are very
dandified monseigneur no it will not bore me
i assure you that it will bore you
no since it is you i shall not understand you but i shall listen
to you when one hears the voices of those whom one loves one does not
need to understand the words that they utter that we should be here
together that is all that i desire i shall remain with you bah
very good said cosette i was going to tell you some news i could
have told you that your grandfather is still asleep that your aunt is
at mass that the chimney in my father fauchelevents room smokes that
nicolette has sent for the chimney sweep that toussaint and nicolette
have already quarrelled that nicolette makes sport of toussaints
stammer well you shall know nothing ah it is impossible you shall
see gentlemen that i in my turn can say it is impossible then who
will be caught i beseech you my little marius let me stay here with
i swear to you that it is indispensable that we should be alone
jean valjean had not uttered a single word cosette turned to him
in the first place father i want you to come and embrace me what do
you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part who gave me
such a father as that you must perceive that my family life is very
unhappy my husband beats me come embrace me instantly
as for you i shall make a face at you
then she presented her brow to jean valjean
father you are pale does your arm hurt you
embrace me if you are well if you sleep well if you are content i
jean valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial
jean valjean obeyed it was the smile of a spectre
get angry father say that i must stay you can certainly talk before
me so you think me very silly what you say is astonishing business
placing money in a bank a great matter truly men make mysteries out of
nothing i am very pretty this morning look at me marius
and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably
and they fell irresistibly into each others arms
now said cosette adjusting a fold of her dressing gown with a
no not that said marius in a supplicating tone we have to finish
i assure you cosette that it is impossible
ah you put on your mans voice sir that is well i go you father
have not upheld me monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are
tyrants i shall go and tell grandpapa if you think that i am going to
return and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken i am proud i shall
wait for you now you shall see that it is you who are going to be
bored without me i am going it is well
two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head
was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them
the door closed again and the shadows descended once more
it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the
marius made sure that the door was securely closed
poor cosette he murmured when she finds out   
at that word jean valjean trembled in every limb he fixed on marius a
cosette oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this
that is right stay i had not thought of that one has the strength for
one thing but not for another sir i conjure you i entreat now sir
give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her is
it not enough that you should know it i have been able to say it myself
without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the
whole world it was all one to me but she she does not know what
it is it would terrify her what a convict we should be obliged to
explain matters to her to say to her he is a man who has been in the
galleys she saw the chain gang pass by one day oh my god    he
dropped into an arm chair and hid his face in his hands
his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it
was evident that he was weeping silent tears terrible tears
there is something of suffocation in the sob he was seized with a sort
of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though
to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his
face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur so low that his
be at your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself
alone and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but
forced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something
as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convict
superposed before his very eyes upon m fauchelevent overcome
little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural
inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been
placed between that man and himself marius added
it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to
the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted that is
an act of probity it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on
you fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you do not fear
i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently
he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the tip of his
fore finger across his thumb nail then he lifted up his voice
all is nearly over but one last thing remains for me   
jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without
voice without breath he stammered rather than said
now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i
i think that would be better replied marius coldly
i shall never see her more murmured jean valjean and he directed his
he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened jean
valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for
a second then closed the door again and turned to marius
he was no longer pale he was livid there were no longer any tears
in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame his voice had regained a
stay sir he said if you will allow it i will come to see her i
assure you that i desire it greatly if i had not cared to see cosette
i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should
have gone away but as i desired to remain in the place where cosette
is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly you
follow my reasoning do you not it is a matter easily understood you
see i have had her with me for more than nine years we lived first
in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the
luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time you remember
her blue plush hat then we went to the quartier des invalides where
there was a railing on a garden the rue plumet i lived in a little
back court yard whence i could hear her piano that was my life we
never left each other that lasted for nine years and some months i
was like her own father and she was my child i do not know whether
you understand monsieur pontmercy but to go away now never to see her
again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would
be hard if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from
time to time i will not come often i will not remain long you shall
give orders that i am to be received in the little waiting room on the
ground floor i could enter perfectly well by the back door but that
might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me
to enter by the usual door truly sir i should like to see a little
more of cosette as rarely as you please put yourself in my place
i have nothing left but that and then we must be cautious if i
no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be
considered singular what i can do by the way is to come in the
you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be
marius saluted jean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and
chapter ii the obscurities which a revelation can contain
the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside
whom he had seen cosette was now explained to him there was something
enigmatic about that person of which his instinct had warned him
this enigma was the most hideous of disgraces the galleys this m
to abruptly find such a secret in the midst of ones happiness resembles
the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves
was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a
neighborhood was this an accomplished fact did the acceptance of that
man form a part of the marriage now consummated was there nothing to be
in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the
grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force even the
archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder
as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked
himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself had he
been wanting in divination had he been wanting in prudence had he
involuntarily dulled his wits a little perhaps had he entered upon
this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without
taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings he
admitted it is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves
in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by little he
admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature a sort of
internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms
of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes
and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing
more than a conscience bathed in a mist we have more than once
he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumet
during those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to
cosette of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken
up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing
flight how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette
yet it was so near and so terrible how had it come to pass that he had
not even named the thenardiers and particularly on the day when he
had encountered eponine he now found it almost difficult to explain his
silence of that time nevertheless he could account for it he recalled
his benumbed state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing
everything that catching away of each other into the ideal and perhaps
also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this
violent and charming state of the soul a vague dull instinct impelling
him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure
contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any
part his agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be
neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser
moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there had been
in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind
examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had
told cosette about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discovered that
jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius would
that have changed her cosette would he have drawn back would he have
adored her any the less would he have refrained from marrying her no
then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach
himself all was well there is a deity for those drunken men who are
called lovers marius blind had followed the path which he would have
chosen had he been in full possession of his sight love had bandaged
his eyes in order to lead him whither to paradise
but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal
marius ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fauchelevent
who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror
in this horror let us state there was some pity and even a certain
this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that
deposit and what a deposit six hundred thousand francs
he alone was in the secret of that deposit he might have kept it all
moreover he had himself revealed his situation nothing forced him to
this if any one learned who he was it was through himself in this
avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there
was acceptance of peril for a condemned man a mask is not a mask it
is a shelter a false name is security and he had rejected that false
name he the galley slave might have hidden himself forever in an
honest family he had withstood this temptation and with what motive
through a conscientious scruple he himself explained this with the
irresistible accents of truth in short whatever this jean valjean
might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening there
existed some mysterious re habilitation which had begun and to all
appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man
such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar
natures an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul
jean valjean was sincere this sincerity visible palpable
irrefragable evident from the very grief that it caused him rendered
inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had
here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations what
breathed from m fauchelevent distrust what did jean valjean inspire
in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius
struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive
principle and he tried to reach a balance
but all this went on as in a storm marius while endeavoring to form a
clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in
the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist
the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were
good this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became
troubled as were marius memories a shadow of them returned to him
after all what was that adventure in the jondrette attic why had that
man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a
here marius found the answer because that man was a fugitive from
another question why had that man come to the barricade
for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had
re appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of
heat this man had been in the barricade he had not fought there what
had he come there for in the presence of this question a spectre sprang
marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean
dragging the pinioned javert out of the barricade and he still heard
behind the corner of the little rue mondetour that frightful pistol
shot obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the
galley slave the one was in the others way jean valjean had gone to
the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself he had arrived late
he probably knew that javert was a prisoner there the corsican vendetta
has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it
is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned
towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who
is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft
and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance jean valjean had killed
javert at least that seemed to be evident
this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no reply
this question marius felt like pincers how had it come to pass that
jean valjeans existence had elbowed that of cosette for so long a
what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child
in contact with that man are there then chains for two which are forged
on high and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the
demon so a crime and an innocence can be room mates in the mysterious
galleys of wretchedness in that defiling of condemned persons which
is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one
ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine
whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an
eternal lightning who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing
off in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community
of life been established between this celestial little creature and that
who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more
incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb for the wolf loved
the lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during
the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of
support cosettes childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight
her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by
that hideous devotion here questions exfoliated so to speak into
innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and
marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy
the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it now
exists and until a broader day shall effect a change in it there will
always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one
which is according to good is abel the other which is according to evil
is cain what was this tender cain what was this ruffian religiously
absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her rearing her
guarding her dignifying her and enveloping her impure as he was
what was that cess pool which had venerated that innocence to such a
point as not to leave upon it a single spot what was this jean valjean
educating cosette what was this figure of the shadows which had for its
only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow
that was jean valjeans secret that was also gods secret
in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled the one in some
sort reassured him as to the other god was as visible in this affair
as was jean valjean god has his instruments he makes use of the tool
which he wills he is not responsible to men do we know how god sets
about the work jean valjean had labored over cosette he had to some
extent made that soul that was incontestable well what then the
workman was horrible but the work was admirable god produces his
miracles as seems good to him he had constructed that charming cosette
and he had employed jean valjean it had pleased him to choose this
strange collaborator for himself what account have we to demand of him
is this the first time that the dung heap has aided the spring to create
marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they
were good he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points
which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he
did not dare to do it he adored cosette he possessed cosette cosette
was splendidly pure that was sufficient for him what enlightenment did
he need cosette was a light does light require enlightenment he had
everything what more could he desire all is not that enough jean
and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast
convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i
am nothing to cosette ten years ago i did not know that she was in
jean valjean was a passer by he had said so himself well he had
passed whatever he was his part was finished
henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to
cosette cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her
lover her husband her celestial male cosette as she took her flight
winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and
in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a
certain horror for jean valjean a sacred horror perhaps for as we
have just pointed out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do what
he would and seek what extenuation he would he was certainly forced to
fall back upon this the man was a convict that is to say a being who
has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the
very lowest rung after the very last of men comes the convict the
convict is no longer so to speak in the semblance of the living the
law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can
marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though
he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the
subject of those whom the law strikes he had not yet accomplished all
progress we admit he had not yet come to distinguish between that
which is written by man and that which is written by god between law
and right he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to
dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable he was not shocked by
the word vindicte he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the
written law should be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted
as the process of civilization social damnation he still stood at this
point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was
good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress
in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and
repulsive he was a man reproved he was the convict that word was
for him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after
having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture
had been to turn away his head vade retro
marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while
interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said
you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three
it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that
he had been afraid of them the jondrette attic the barricade javert
who knows where these revelations would have stopped jean valjean did
not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius
after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him
has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjunctures to
stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have
asked a question it is especially when one loves that one gives way
to these exhibitions of cowardice it is not wise to question sinister
situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of
our life is fatally intermingled with them what a terrible light might
have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who
knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far
as cosette who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have
lingered behind it on the brow of that angel the spattering of a
lightning flash is of the thunder also fatality has points of juncture
where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the
reflections which give color the purest figures may forever preserve
the reflection of a horrible association rightly or wrongly marius
had been afraid he already knew too much he sought to dull his senses
in dismay he bore off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean
that man was the night the living and horrible night how should he
dare to seek the bottom of it it is a terrible thing to interrogate
the shadow who knows what its reply will be the dawn may be blackened
in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come
into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to
he now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable
questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable
and definitive decision might have sprung he felt that he was too good
too gentle too weak if we must say the word this weakness had led him
to an imprudent concession he had allowed himself to be touched he
had been in the wrong he ought to have simply and purely rejected
jean valjean jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he
should have done and have freed his house from that man
he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions
which had deafened blinded and carried him away he was displeased
what was he to do now jean valjeans visits were profoundly repugnant
to him what was the use in having that man in his house what did the
man want here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did
not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself he
had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean
valjean held his promise one must keep ones word even to a convict
above all to a convict still his first duty was to cosette in short
he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him
marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing
from one to the other and moved by all of them hence arose a profound
it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a
however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as
candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her
childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that
convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man
can be towards cosette all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had
surmised was real that sinister nettle had loved and protected that
on the following day at nightfall jean valjean knocked at the carriage
gate of the gillenormand house it was basque who received him basque
was in the courtyard at the appointed hour as though he had received
his orders it sometimes happens that one says to a servant you will
watch for mr so and so when he arrives
basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach
monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to
basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the
the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the
ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the
street was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated
this chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the
feather duster the popes head brush and the broom the dust rested
tranquilly there persecution of the spiders was not organized there a
fine web which spread far and wide and was very black and ornamented
with dead flies formed a wheel on one of the window panes the room
which was small and low ceiled was furnished with a heap of empty
the wall which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash was scaling off in
large flakes at one end there was a chimney piece painted in black
with a narrow shelf a fire was burning there which indicated that jean
valjeans reply i will remain below had been foreseen
two arm chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace between
the chairs an old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread
than wool had been spread by way of a carpet
the chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight
jean valjean was fatigued for days he had neither eaten nor slept he
threw himself into one of the arm chairs
basque returned set a lighted candle on the chimney piece and retired
jean valjean his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast
all at once he drew himself up with a start cosette was standing
he had not seen her enter but he had felt that she was there
he turned round he gazed at her she was adorably lovely but what he
was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her
well exclaimed cosette father i knew that you were peculiar but
i never should have expected this what an idea marius told me that you
i expected that reply good i warn you that i am going to make a scene
for you let us begin at the beginning embrace me father
you do not stir i take note of it attitude of guilt but never mind
i pardon you jesus christ said offer the other cheek here it is
