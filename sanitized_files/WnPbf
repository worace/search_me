improvised ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked natasha for a
valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she
was bewitching and that he loved her during the ecossaise which she
also danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be by
themselves but merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyes
to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look
and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had to
dont say such things to me i am betrothed and love another she said
anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said
dont speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell you i am
madly madly in love with you is it my fault that you are
natasha animated and excited looked about her with wide open
frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardly
anything that went on that evening they danced the ecossaise and the
grossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain
wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes
upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her
go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that helene had followed
her and spoken laughingly of her brothers love and that she again met
anatole in the little sitting room helene had disappeared leaving them
alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice
i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see
you i love you madly can i never and blocking her path he
his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
i dont understand i have nothing to say her eyes replied
burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt
herself released and helenes footsteps and the rustle of her dress
were heard in the room natasha looked round at her and then red and
trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved
one word just one for gods sake cried anatole
she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
had happened and to which she could find no answer
natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not
knowing what to say and he repeated it till helene came up to them
helene returned with natasha to the drawing room the rostovs went away
after reaching home natasha did not sleep all night she was tormented
by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew
she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else how
could all this have happened thought she if after that i could
return his smile when saying good by if i was able to let it come to
that it means that i loved him from the first it means that he is
kind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i to
do if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to
morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began to
move about and talk dressmakers came again marya dmitrievna appeared
and they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking uneasily at
everybody with wide open eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance
directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual
after breakfast which was her best time marya dmitrievna sat down in
her armchair and called natasha and the count to her
well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my
advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince
bolkonski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to
begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had
he hes crazy he did not want to listen but whats the use of
talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said marya
dmitrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back home
yes go back said marya dmitrievna and wait there if your
betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone
with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you
count rostov approved of this suggestion appreciating its
reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding
against his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoe
that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took her
no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he
wont thats his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for something
in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing
to wait for and what is not ready ill send after you though i dont
like letting you go it is the best way so go with gods blessing
having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
natasha it was a letter from princess mary
she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing shes
afraid you might think that she does not like you
i shant believe anyone i know she doesnt like me replied natasha
boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry
resolution that caused marya dmitrievna to look at her more intently and
dont answer like that my good girl she said what i say is true
write an answer natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read
princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
had occurred between them whatever her fathers feelings might be she
begged natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one
chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice
do not think however she wrote that my father is ill disposed
toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he
is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy
princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time when she could see
after reading the letter natasha sat down at the writing table to answer
it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically and
then paused what more could she write after all that had happened the
evening before yes yes all that has happened and now all is
changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before
her must i break off with him must i really thats awful and to
escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sonya and began sorting
after dinner natasha went to her room and again took up princess marys
letter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be that
all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went
before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former
strength and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin she vividly
pictured herself as prince andrews wife and the scenes of happiness
with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the same
time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdays
why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete
bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have to
choose and i cant be happy without either of them only she thought
to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both
equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i
really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrews love in which i
please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
air a man told me to give you this  and she handed natasha a letter
only for christs sake the girl went on as natasha without
thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it
was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she loved him or
else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she
have a love letter from him in her hand
with trembling hands natasha held that passionate love letter which
dolokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an
echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling
since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or
to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went on
to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for this
there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if she
loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power could
hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and
carry her off to the ends of the earth
yes yes i love him thought natasha reading the letter for the
twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
that evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs and proposed to
take the girls with her natasha pleading a headache remained at home
on returning late in the evening sonya went to natashas room and to
her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the
table beside her lay anatoles letter sonya picked it up and read it
as she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha trying to find in her
face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her
face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself
from choking sonya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat
down in an armchair and burst into tears
how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left
off loving prince andrew and how could she let kuragin go to such
lengths he is a deceiver and a villain thats plain what will
nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the
meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before
yesterday yesterday and today thought sonya but it cant be that
she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was
from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing
sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha again scanning her
and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
awakening she embraced her friend but noticing sonyas look of
embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion
no sonya i cant any longer she said i cant hide it from you any
longer you know we love one another sonya darling he writes
sonya stared open eyed at natasha unable to believe her ears
ah sonya if you only knew how happy i am cried natasha you dont
natasha looked at sonya with wide open eyes as if she could not grasp
well then are you refusing prince andrew said sonya
oh you dont understand anything dont talk nonsense just listen
but i cant believe it insisted sonya i dont understand how is it
you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you have only
seen him three times natasha i dont believe you youre joking in
three days said natasha it seems to me ive loved him a hundred
years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you cant
understand it sonya wait a bit sit here and natasha embraced and
i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too
but its only now that i feel such love its not the same as before as
soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i
could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall
do you dont understand that what can i do what can i do sonya
cried natasha with a happy yet frightened expression
but think what you are doing cried sonya i cant leave it like
this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so far
she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal
i told you that i have no will natasha replied why cant you
then i wont let it come to that i shall tell cried sonya
what do you mean for gods sake if you tell you are my enemy
declared natasha you want me to be miserable you want us to be
when she saw natashas fright sonya shed tears of shame and pity for
but what has happened between you she asked what has he said to
you why doesnt he come to the house
for gods sake sonya dont tell anyone dont torture me natasha
entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such matters i have
but why this secrecy why doesnt he come to the house asked sonya
why doesnt he openly ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave
you complete freedom if it is really so but i dont believe it
natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can be
natasha looked at sonya with astonishment evidently this question
presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
i dont know what the reasons are but there must be reasons
but natasha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm
sonya one cant doubt him one cant one cant dont you
does he love me natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friends
lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and you have seen
he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natasha
if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
cease seeing you and if you wont do this i will i will write to him
and i will tell papa said sonya resolutely
but i cant live without him cried natasha
natasha i dont understand you and what are you saying think of your
i dont want anyone i dont love anyone but him how dare you say he
is dishonorable dont you know that i love him screamed natasha go
away sonya i dont want to quarrel with you but go for gods sake
go you see how i am suffering natasha cried angrily in a voice of
despair and repressed irritation sonya burst into sobs and ran from the
natasha went to the table and without a moments reflection wrote that
answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the
morning in this letter she said briefly that all their
misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the
magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
freedom she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her
if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife
at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha
on friday the rostovs were to return to the country but on wednesday
the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow
on the day the count left sonya and natasha were invited to a big
dinner party at the karagins and marya dmitrievna took them there at
that party natasha again met anatole and sonya noticed that she spoke
to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was
more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was the first to
there sonya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him
natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
well what happened what did he say natasha how glad i am youre not
angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he say
oh sonya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had
promised bolkonski he was glad i was free to refuse him
perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolkonski why do
i dont think anything only i dont understand this
wait a bit sonya youll understand everything youll see what a man
he is now dont think badly of me or of him i dont think badly of
anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do
sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her the
more emotional and ingratiating the expression of natashas face became
natasha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i havent
spoken but now you yourself have begun i dont trust him natasha why
i am afraid youre going to your ruin said sonya resolutely and was
and ill go to my ruin i will as soon as possible its not your
business it wont be you but i wholl suffer leave me alone leave
i hate you i hate you youre my enemy forever and natasha ran out
natasha did not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the same
expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house
taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them
hard as it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her out
the day before the count was to return sonya noticed that natasha sat
by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom sonya took to be
sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
at dinner and all that evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural
state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not
after tea sonya noticed a housemaid at natashas door timidly waiting to
let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door
then suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some dreadful
plan for that evening sonya knocked at her door natasha did not let
she will run away with him thought sonya she is capable of
anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her
face today she cried as she said good by to uncle sonya remembered
yes thats it she means to elope with him but what am i to do
thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natasha
had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write
to kuragin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to
reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some
misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski she
sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell
marya dmitrievna who had such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible
well anyway thought sonya as she stood in the dark passage now or
never i must prove that i remember the familys goodness to me and that
i love nicholas yes if i dont sleep for three nights ill not leave
this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
anatole had lately moved to dolokhovs the plan for natalie rostovas
abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dolokhov a few
days before and on the day that sonya after listening at natashas
door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution
natasha had promised to come out to kuragin at the back porch at ten
that evening kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready
and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka where an
unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over
them at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post
anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he
had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
two witnesses for the mock marriage khvostikov a retired petty
official whom dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and
makarin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded
affection for kuragin were sitting at tea in dolokhovs front room
in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dolokhov in a traveling cloak
and high boots at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles of
paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from
the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room
behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his
things dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down
well he said khvostikov must have two thousand
makarka their name for makarin will go through fire and water for
you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dolokhov
yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dolokhov
and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his
dolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to anatole with an
do you know youd really better drop it all theres still time
fool retorted anatole dont talk nonsense if you only knew its
no really give it up said dolokhov i am speaking seriously its
what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a
grimace really its no time for your stupid jokes and he left the
dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone
you wait a bit he called after him im not joking im talking
anatole returned and looked at dolokhov trying to give him his
now listen to me im telling you this for the last time why should i
joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for you who
found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did it
well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole
i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a
dangerous business and if you think about it a stupid business well
youll carry her off all right will they let it stop at that it will
come out that youre already married why theyll have you in the
oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace
didnt i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality dull
witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own
reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to dolokhov a
hundred times didnt i explain to you that i have come to this
conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one
finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no
matter abroad no one will know anything about it isnt that so and
seriously youd better drop it youll only get yourself into a mess
go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the room
but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov
with his feet turned under him its the very devil what feel how it
beats he took dolokhovs hand and put it on his heart what a foot
my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he added in french what
dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him
well and when the moneys gone what then
what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of
the future what then then i dont know but why talk
nonsense he glanced at his watch its time
now then nearly ready youre dawdling he shouted to the servants
dolokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring
something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into
the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting
anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself
come and eat something have a drink dolokhov shouted to him from the
i dont want to answered anatole continuing to smile
anatole rose and went into the dining room balaga was a famous troyka
driver who had known dolokhov and anatole some six years and had given
them good service with his troykas more than once when anatoles
regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the
evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again
the next night more than once he had enabled dolokhov to escape when
pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of
moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my
gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in their
service more than once they had beaten him and more than once they had
made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and he knew
more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
ordinary man to siberia they often called balaga into their orgies and
made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand
rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he
risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service
had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy but he
liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked
upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full
gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild tipsy
shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible to go any
faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who
more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way real
anatole and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and
because he liked the things they liked with others balaga bargained
charging twenty five rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove
himself generally letting his young men do so but with his gentlemen
he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a
couple of times a year when he knew from their valets that they had
money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep
bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always made him sit down
do help me out theodore ivanych sir or your excellency he would
say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go to the
and anatole and dolokhov when they had money would give him a thousand
balaga was a fair haired short and snub nosed peasant of about twenty
seven red faced with a particularly red thick neck glittering little
eyes and a small beard he wore a fine dark blue silk lined cloth
on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front
corner of the room and went up to dolokhov holding out a small black
how dyou do friend well here he is
good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to
i say balaga said anatole putting his hands on the mans shoulders
do you care for me or not eh now do me a service what horses
as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balaga
well listen balaga drive all three to death but get me there in
when they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink
mind ill smash your face in dont make jokes cried anatole
why joke said the driver laughing as if id grudge my gentlemen
anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast well go
sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large
the drivers eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it
for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
and when are we to start your excellency
well anatole looked at his watch well start at once mind
that depends on our luck in starting else why shouldnt we be there in
time replied balaga didnt we get you to tver in seven hours i
do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole smilingly
at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him
with wide open eyes will you believe it makarka it took ones breath
away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and
those were horses balaga continued the tale that time id harnessed
two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning
to dolokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those animals flew
forty miles i couldnt hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp
frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold yourself your
excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and
sprawled there it wasnt a case of urging them on there was no holding
them in till we reached the place the devils took us there in three
hours only the near one died of it
anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a
fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one
side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror
and standing before dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it
well good by theodore thank you for everything and farewell said
anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment
of my youth farewell he said turning to makarin and the others
though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make
something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he
spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my
youth weve had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when
shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now
farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his
to your health said balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his
makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes
ah prince how sorry i am to part from you
no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down
they shut the door and all sat down
joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all
and wheres the fur cloak asked dolokhov hey ignatka go to
matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what
elopements are like continued dolokhov with a wink why shell rush
out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay
at all therell be tears and papa and mamma and shes frozen in a
minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first
the valet brought a womans fox lined cloak
fool i told you the sable one hey matrena the sable he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms
a handsome slim and pale faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blue black hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable
here i dont grudge it take it she said evidently afraid of her
dolokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matrena and
thats the way said dolokhov and then so and he turned the collar
up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and
then so do you see and he pushed anatoles head forward to meet the
gap left by the collar through which matrenas brilliant smile was
well good by matrena said anatole kissing her ah my revels here
are over remember me to steshka there good by good bye matrena
well prince may god give you great luck said matrena in her gypsy
two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
holding the horses balaga took his seat in the front one and holding
his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dolokhov
got in with him makarin khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in
go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore
tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balaga and
of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be
heard on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage
something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the
after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard balaga began to
rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny
the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole
and dolokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate
dolokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out
come into the courtyard or youll be seen shell come out directly
dolokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the
courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch
he was met by gabriel marya dmitrievnas gigantic footman
come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass
to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper
kindly step in my orders are to bring you in
dolokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was
struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last
desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran
back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back
marya dmitrievna having found sonya weeping in the corridor made her
confess everything and intercepting the note to natasha she read it and
went into natashas room with it in her hand
you shameless good for nothing said she i wont hear a word
pushing back natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to
admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them
out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she
seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors
when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away
again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced
through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward
midnight she went to natashas room fingering the key in her pocket
sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for gods
sake let me in to her she pleaded but marya dmitrievna unlocked the
door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting
abominable in my house horrid girl hussy im only sorry for her
father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may be
ill tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
count she entered the room with resolute steps natasha lying on the
sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in
just the same position in which marya dmitrievna had left her
a nice girl very nice said marya dmitrievna arranging meetings
with lovers in my house its no use pretending you listen when i speak
to you and marya dmitrievna touched her arm listen when i speak
youve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies id treat you
differently but im sorry for your father so i will conceal it
natasha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with
noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her marya dmitrievna glanced
round at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha
its lucky for him that he escaped me but ill find him she said in
her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added
she put her large hand under natashas face and turned it toward her
both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how natasha
looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her
let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered
wrenching herself from marya dmitrievnas hands with a vicious effort
and sinking down again into her former position
natalie said marya dmitrievna i wish for your good lie still stay
like that then i wont touch you but listen i wont tell you how
guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back
tomorrow what am i to tell him eh
suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed
i have no betrothed i have refused him cried natasha
thats all the same continued marya dmitrievna if they hear of
this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he
challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh
oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you
to shouted natasha raising herself on the sofa and looking
but what did you want cried marya dmitrievna growing angry again
were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house
why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he
had carried you off do you think they wouldnt have found him your
father or brother or your betrothed and hes a scoundrel a wretch
he is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if you
hadnt interfered oh my god what is it all what is it sonya
and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned marya
dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried out
go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself
marya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her
that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
would know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake to
forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened
natasha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold and
had a shivering fit marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her head
covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some lime flower
water but natasha did not respond to her
well let her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went out of the room
but natasha was not asleep with pale face and fixed wide open eyes she
looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and
did not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several times
next day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time for
lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with
the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep
him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed marya
dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell the
day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was
better now natasha had not left her room that morning with compressed
and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily
watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and
that he would come or would write to her
when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
of a mans footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter
with you my angel are you ill asked the count
after a moments silence natasha answered yes ill
in reply to the counts anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that
nothing had happened and asked him not to worry marya dmitrievna
confirmed natashas assurances that nothing had happened from the
pretense of illness from his daughters distress and by the
embarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count saw clearly
that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible
for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he
avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go
away somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rostovs came to
moscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his
intention he went to tver to see joseph alexeevichs widow who had
long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from marya
dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
importance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed pierre had
been avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
was stronger than a married mans should be for his friends fiancee
