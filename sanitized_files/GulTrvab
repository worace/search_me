about two or three days before i was set at liberty as i was
entertaining the court with this kind of feat there arrived an express
to inform his majesty that some of his subjects riding near the place
where i was first taken up had seen a great black substance lying on the
around very oddly shaped extending its edges round as wide as his
majestys bedchamber and rising up in the middle as high as a man that
it was no living creature as they at first apprehended for it lay on
the grass without motion and some of them had walked round it several
times that by mounting upon each others shoulders they had got to the
top which was flat and even and stamping upon it they found that it
was hollow within that they humbly conceived it might be something
belonging to the man mountain and if his majesty pleased they would
undertake to bring it with only five horses i presently knew what they
meant and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence it seems
upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck i was in such
confusion that before i came to the place where i went to sleep my hat
which i had fastened with a string to my head while i was rowing and had
stuck on all the time i was swimming fell off after i came to land the
string as i conjecture breaking by some accident which i never
observed but thought my hat had been lost at sea i entreated his
imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as
possible describing to him the use and the nature of it and the next
day the waggoners arrived with it but not in a very good condition they
had bored two holes in the brim within an inch and half of the edge and
fastened two hooks in the holes these hooks were tied by a long cord to
the harness and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an english
mile but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level
two days after this adventure the emperor having ordered that part of
his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readiness
took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner he desired
i would stand like a colossus with my legs as far asunder as i
conveniently could he then commanded his general who was an old
experienced leader and a great patron of mine to draw up the troops in
close order and march them under me the foot by twenty four abreast
and the horse by sixteen with drums beating colours flying and pikes
advanced this body consisted of three thousand foot and a thousand
horse his majesty gave orders upon pain of death that every soldier
in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my
person which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from
turning up their eyes as they passed under me and to confess the truth
my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition that they afforded
i had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty that his
majesty at length mentioned the matter first in the cabinet and then in
a full council where it was opposed by none except skyresh bolgolam
who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy but it
was carried against him by the whole board and confirmed by the emperor
that minister was galbet or admiral of the realm very much in his
masters confidence and a person well versed in affairs but of a morose
and sour complexion however he was at length persuaded to comply but
prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which i should be set
free and to which i must swear should be drawn up by himself these
articles were brought to me by skyresh bolgolam in person attended by two
under secretaries and several persons of distinction after they were
read i was demanded to swear to the performance of them first in the
manner of my own country and afterwards in the method prescribed by
their laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand and to
place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and my
thumb on the tip of my right ear but because the reader may be curious
to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that
people as well as to know the article upon which i recovered my liberty
i have made a translation of the whole instrument word for word as near
as i was able which i here offer to the public
golbasto momarem evlame gurdilo shefin mully ully gue most mighty
emperor of lilliput delight and terror of the universe whose dominions
extend five thousand blustrugs about twelve miles in circumference to
the extremities of the globe monarch of all monarchs taller than the
sons of men whose feet press down to the centre and whose head strikes
against the sun at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees
pleasant as the spring comfortable as the summer fruitful as autumn
dreadful as winter his most sublime majesty proposes to the
man mountain lately arrived at our celestial dominions the following
articles which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform
1st the man mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our
2d he shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our
express order at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours
3d the said man mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high
roads and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn
4th as he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to
trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects their horses or
carriages nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own
5th if an express requires extraordinary despatch the man mountain
shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six
days journey once in every moon and return the said messenger back if
6th he shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of blefuscu
and do his utmost to destroy their fleet which is now preparing to
7th that the said man mountain shall at his times of leisure be
aiding and assisting to our workmen in helping to raise certain great
stones towards covering the wall of the principal park and other our
8th that the said man mountain shall in two moons time deliver in an
exact survey of the circumference of our dominions by a computation of
lastly that upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles
the said man mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink
sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects with free access to
our royal person and other marks of our favour given at our palace at
belfaborac the twelfth day of the ninety first moon of our reign
i swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and
content although some of them were not so honourable as i could have
wished which proceeded wholly from the malice of skyresh bolgolam the
high admiral whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked and i was at
full liberty the emperor himself in person did me the honour to be by
at the whole ceremony i made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself
at his majestys feet but he commanded me to rise and after many
gracious expressions which to avoid the censure of vanity i shall not
repeat he added that he hoped i should prove a useful servant and
well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me or might
the reader may please to observe that in the last article of the
recovery of my liberty the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 lilliputians some
time after asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that
determinate number he told me that his majestys mathematicians having
taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant and finding it to
exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one they concluded from the
similarity of their bodies that mine must contain at least 1724 of
theirs and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to
support that number of lilliputians by which the reader may conceive an
idea of the ingenuity of that people as well as the prudent and exact
mildendo the metropolis of lilliput described together with the
emperors palace a conversation between the author and a principal
secretary concerning the affairs of that empire the authors offers to
the first request i made after i had obtained my liberty was that i
might have license to see mildendo the metropolis which the emperor
easily granted me but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the
inhabitants or their houses the people had notice by proclamation of
my design to visit the town the wall which encompassed it is two feet
and a half high and at least eleven inches broad so that a coach and
horses may be driven very safely round it and it is flanked with strong
towers at ten feet distance i stepped over the great western gate and
passed very gently and sidling through the two principal streets only
in my short waistcoat for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the
houses with the skirts of my coat i walked with the utmost
circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in
the streets although the orders were very strict that all people should
keep in their houses at their own peril the garret windows and tops of
houses were so crowded with spectators that i thought in all my travels
i had not seen a more populous place the city is an exact square each
side of the wall being five hundred feet long the two great streets
which run across and divide it into four quarters are five feet wide
the lanes and alleys which i could not enter but only view them as i
passed are from twelve to eighteen inches the town is capable of
holding five hundred thousand souls the houses are from three to five
the emperors palace is in the centre of the city where the two great
streets meet it is enclosed by a wall of two feet high and twenty feet
distance from the buildings i had his majestys permission to step over
this wall and the space being so wide between that and the palace i
could easily view it on every side the outward court is a square of
forty feet and includes two other courts in the inmost are the royal
apartments which i was very desirous to see but found it extremely
difficult for the great gates from one square into another were but
eighteen inches high and seven inches wide now the buildings of the
outer court were at least five feet high and it was impossible for me to
stride over them without infinite damage to the pile though the walls
were strongly built of hewn stone and four inches thick at the same
time the emperor had a great desire that i should see the magnificence of
his palace but this i was not able to do till three days after which i
spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the
royal park about a hundred yards distant from the city of these trees
i made two stools each about three feet high and strong enough to bear
my weight the people having received notice a second time i went again
through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands when i
came to the side of the outer court i stood upon one stool and took the
other in my hand this i lifted over the roof and gently set it down on
the space between the first and second court which was eight feet wide
i then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the
other and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick by this
contrivance i got into the inmost court and lying down upon my side i
applied my face to the windows of the middle stories which were left
open on purpose and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be
imagined there i saw the empress and the young princes in their
several lodgings with their chief attendants about them her imperial
majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me and gave me out of
but i shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this
kind because i reserve them for a greater work which is now almost
ready for the press containing a general description of this empire
from its first erection through along series of princes with a
particular account of their wars and politics laws learning and
religion their plants and animals their peculiar manners and customs
with other matters very curious and useful my chief design at present
being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the
public or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that
one morning about a fortnight after i had obtained my liberty
reldresal principal secretary as they style him for private affairs
came to my house attended only by one servant he ordered his coach to
wait at a distance and desired i would give him an hours audience which
i readily consented to on account of his quality and personal merits as
well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations
at court i offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently
reach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during
our conversation he began with compliments on my liberty said he
might pretend to some merit in it but however added that if it had
not been for the present situation of things at court perhaps i might
not have obtained it so soon for said he as flourishing a condition
as we may appear to be in to foreigners we labour under two mighty
evils a violent faction at home and the danger of an invasion by a
most potent enemy from abroad as to the first you are to understand
that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties
in this empire under the names of tramecksan and slamecksan from
the high and low heels of their shoes by which they distinguish
themselves it is alleged indeed that the high heels are most
agreeable to our ancient constitution but however this be his majesty
has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the
government and all offices in the gift of the crown as you cannot but
observe and particularly that his majestys imperial heels are lower at
least by a drurr than any of his court drurr is a measure about the
fourteenth part of an inch the animosities between these two parties
run so high that they will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each
other we compute the tramecksan or high heels to exceed us in
number but the power is wholly on our side we apprehend his imperial
highness the heir to the crown to have some tendency towards the high
heels at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher
than the other which gives him a hobble in his gait now in the midst
of these intestine disquiets we are threatened with an invasion from the
island of blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universe
almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty for as to what we
have heard you affirm that there are other kingdoms and states in the
world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophers
are in much doubt and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the
moon or one of the stars because it is certain that a hundred mortals
of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of
his majestys dominions besides our histories of six thousand moons
make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of
lilliput and blefuscu which two mighty powers have as i was going to
tell you been engaged in a most obstinate war for six and thirty moons
past it began upon the following occasion it is allowed on all hands
that the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat them was upon the
larger end but his present majestys grandfather while he was a boy
going to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practice
happened to cut one of his fingers whereupon the emperor his father
published an edict commanding all his subjects upon great penalties to
break the smaller end of their eggs the people so highly resented this
law that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised on
that account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crown
these civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of
blefuscu and when they were quelled the exiles always fled for refuge
to that empire it is computed that eleven thousand persons have at
several times suffered death rather than submit to break their eggs at
the smaller end many hundred large volumes have been published upon
this controversy but the books of the big endians have been long
forbidden and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding
employments during the course of these troubles the emperors of
blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors accusing us of
making a schism in religion by offending against a fundamental doctrine
of our great prophet lustrog in the fifty fourth chapter of the
blundecral which is their alcoran this however is thought to be a
mere strain upon the text for the words are these that all true
believers break their eggs at the convenient end and which is the
convenient end seems in my humble opinion to be left to every mans
conscience or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to
determine now the big endian exiles have found so much credit in the
emperor of blefuscus court and so much private assistance and
encouragement from their party here at home that a bloody war has been
carried on between the two empires for six and thirty moons with various
success during which time we have lost forty capital ships and a much a
greater number of smaller vessels together with thirty thousand of our
best seamen and soldiers and the damage received by the enemy is
reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours however they have now
equipped a numerous fleet and are just preparing to make a descent upon
us and his imperial majesty placing great confidence in your valour and
strength has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before
i desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor and to
let him know that i thought it would not become me who was a
foreigner to interfere with parties but i was ready with the hazard of
my life to defend his person and state against all invaders
the author by an extraordinary stratagem prevents an invasion a high
title of honour is conferred upon him ambassadors arrive from the
emperor of blefuscu and sue for peace the empresss apartment on fire
by an accident the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace
the empire of blefuscu is an island situated to the north east of
lilliput from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred
yards wide i had not yet seen it and upon this notice of an intended
invasion i avoided appearing on that side of the coast for fear of
being discovered by some of the enemys ships who had received no
intelligence of me all intercourse between the two empires having been
strictly forbidden during the war upon pain of death and an embargo
laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever i communicated to his
majesty a project i had formed of seizing the enemys whole fleet which
as our scouts assured us lay at anchor in the harbour ready to sail
with the first fair wind i consulted the most experienced seamen upon
the depth of the channel which they had often plumbed who told me that
in the middle at high water it was seventy glumgluffs deep which is
about six feet of european measure and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs
at most i walked towards the north east coast over against blefuscu
where lying down behind a hillock i took out my small perspective
glass and viewed the enemys fleet at anchor consisting of about fifty
men of war and a great number of transports i then came back to my
house and gave orders for which i had a warrant for a great quantity
of the strongest cable and bars of iron the cable was about as thick as
packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting needle i
trebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason i twisted
three of the iron bars together bending the extremities into a hook
having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables i went back to the
north east coast and putting off my coat shoes and stockings walked
into the sea in my leathern jerkin about half an hour before high
water i waded with what haste i could and swam in the middle about
thirty yards till i felt ground i arrived at the fleet in less than
half an hour the enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they
leaped out of their ships and swam to shore where there could not be
fewer than thirty thousand souls i then took my tackling and
fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each i tied all the cords
together at the end while i was thus employed the enemy discharged
several thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face and
beside the excessive smart gave me much disturbance in my work my
greatest apprehension was for mine eyes which i should have infallibly
lost if i had not suddenly thought of an expedient i kept among other
little necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket which as i
observed before had escaped the emperors searchers these i took out
and fastened as strongly as i could upon my nose and thus armed went on
boldly with my work in spite of the enemys arrows many of which struck
against the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effect
further than a little to discompose them i had now fastened all the
hooks and taking the knot in my hand began to pull but not a ship
would stir for they were all too fast held by their anchors so that the
boldest part of my enterprise remained i therefore let go the cord and
leaving the looks fixed to the ships i resolutely cut with my knife the
cables that fastened the anchors receiving about two hundred shots in my
face and hands then i took up the knotted end of the cables to which my
hooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largest
the blefuscudians who had not the least imagination of what i intended
were at first confounded with astonishment they had seen me cut the
cables and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or
fall foul on each other but when they perceived the whole fleet moving
in order and saw me pulling at the end they set up such a scream of
grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive
when i had got out of danger i stopped awhile to pick out the arrows
that stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointment
that was given me at my first arrival as i have formerly mentioned i
then took off my spectacles and waiting about an hour till the tide was
a little fallen i waded through the middle with my cargo and arrived
the emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issue
of this great adventure they saw the ships move forward in a large
half moon but could not discern me who was up to my breast in water
when i advanced to the middle of the channel they were yet more in pain
because i was under water to my neck the emperor concluded me to be
drowned and that the enemys fleet was approaching in a hostile manner
but he was soon eased of his fears for the channel growing shallower
every step i made i came in a short time within hearing and holding up
the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened i cried in a loud
voice long live the most puissant king of lilliput this great prince
received me at my landing with all possible encomiums and created me a
nardac upon the spot which is the highest title of honour among them
his majesty desired i would take some other opportunity of bringing all
the rest of his enemys ships into his ports and so unmeasureable is
the ambition of princes that he seemed to think of nothing less than
reducing the whole empire of blefuscu into a province and governing it
by a viceroy of destroying the big endian exiles and compelling that
people to break the smaller end of their eggs by which he would remain
the sole monarch of the whole world but i endeavoured to divert him
from this design by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as
well as justice and i plainly protested that i would never be an
instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery and when
the matter was debated in council the wisest part of the ministry were
this open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and
politics of his imperial majesty that he could never forgive me he
mentioned it in a very artful manner at council where i was told that
some of the wisest appeared at least by their silence to be of my
opinion but others who were my secret enemies could not forbear some
expressions which by a side wind reflected on me and from this time
began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers
maliciously bent against me which broke out in less than two months and
had like to have ended in my utter destruction of so little weight are
the greatest services to princes when put into the balance with a
about three weeks after this exploit there arrived a solemn embassy from
blefuscu with humble offers of a peace which was soon concluded upon
conditions very advantageous to our emperor wherewith i shall not
trouble the reader there were six ambassadors with a train of about
five hundred persons and their entry was very magnificent suitable to
the grandeur of their master and the importance of their business when
their treaty was finished wherein i did them several good offices by the
credit i now had or at least appeared to have at court their
excellencies who were privately told how much i had been their friend
made me a visit in form they began with many compliments upon my valour
and generosity invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their masters
name and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength
of which they had heard so many wonders wherein i readily obliged them
but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars
when i had for some time entertained their excellencies to their
infinite satisfaction and surprise i desired they would do me the honour
to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master the
renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with
admiration and whose royal person i resolved to attend before i
returned to my own country accordingly the next time i had the honour
to see our emperor i desired his general license to wait on the
blefuscudian monarch which he was pleased to grant me as i could
perceive in a very cold manner but could not guess the reason till i
had a whisper from a certain person that flimnap and bolgolam had
represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of
disaffection from which i am sure my heart was wholly free and this
was the first time i began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and
it is to be observed that these ambassadors spoke to me by an
interpreter the languages of both empires differing as much from each
other as any two in europe and each nation priding itself upon the
antiquity beauty and energy of their own tongue with an avowed
contempt for that of their neighbour yet our emperor standing upon the
advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet obliged them to
deliver their credentials and make their speech in the lilliputian
tongue and it must be confessed that from the great intercourse of
trade and commerce between both realms from the continual reception of
exiles which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empire
to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other in order to
polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men and manners
there are few persons of distinction or merchants or seamen who dwell
in the maritime parts but what can hold conversation in both tongues as
i found some weeks after when i went to pay my respects to the emperor
of blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortunes through the malice
of my enemies proved a very happy adventure to me as i shall relate in
the reader may remember that when i signed those articles upon which i
recovered my liberty there were some which i disliked upon account of
their being too servile neither could anything but an extreme necessity
have forced me to submit but being now a nardac of the highest rank
in that empire such offices were looked upon as below my dignity and
the emperor to do him justice never once mentioned them to me
however it was not long before i had an opportunity of doing his
majesty at least as i then thought a most signal service i was
alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door by
which being suddenly awaked i was in some kind of terror i heard the
word burglum repeated incessantly several of the emperors court
making their way through the crowd entreated me to come immediately to
the palace where her imperial majestys apartment was on fire by the
carelessness of a maid of honour who fell asleep while she was reading a
romance i got up in an instant and orders being given to clear the way
before me and it being likewise a moonshine night i made a shift to get
to the palace without trampling on any of the people i found they had
already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment and were well
provided with buckets but the water was at some distance these buckets
were about the size of large thimbles and the poor people supplied me
with them as fast as they could but the flame was so violent that they
did little good i might easily have stifled it with my coat which i
unfortunately left behind me for haste and came away only in my leathern
jerkin the case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable and this
magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground
if by a presence of mind unusual to me i had not suddenly thought of an
expedient i had the evening before drunk plentifully of a most
delicious wine called glimigrim the blefuscudians call it flunec
but ours is esteemed the better sort which is very diuretic by the
luckiest chance in the world i had not discharged myself of any part of
it the heat i had contracted by coming very near the flames and by
labouring to quench them made the wine begin to operate by urine which
i voided in such a quantity and applied so well to the proper places
that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished and the rest of
that noble pile which had cost so many ages in erecting preserved from
it was now day light and i returned to my house without waiting to
congratulate with the emperor because although i had done a very
eminent piece of service yet i could not tell how his majesty might
resent the manner by which i had performed it for by the fundamental
laws of the realm it is capital in any person of what quality soever
to make water within the precincts of the palace but i was a little
comforted by a message from his majesty that he would give orders to
the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form which however i
could not obtain and i was privately assured that the empress
conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what i had done removed to the
most distant side of the court firmly resolved that those buildings
should never be repaired for her use and in the presence of her chief
of the inhabitants of lilliput their learning laws and customs the
manner of educating their children the authors way of living in that
although i intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular
treatise yet in the mean time i am content to gratify the curious
reader with some general ideas as the common size of the natives is
somewhat under six inches high so there is an exact proportion in all
other animals as well as plants and trees for instance the tallest
horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height the sheep an
inch and half more or less their geese about the bigness of a sparrow
and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest
which to my sight were almost invisible but nature has adapted the eyes
of the lilliputians to all objects proper for their view they see with
great exactness but at no great distance and to show the sharpness of
their sight towards objects that are near i have been much pleased with
observing a cook pulling a lark which was not so large as a common fly
and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk
their tallest trees are about seven feet high i mean some of those in
the great royal park the tops whereof i could but just reach with my
fist clenched the other vegetables are in the same proportion but this
i shall say but little at present of their learning which for many
ages has flourished in all its branches among them but their manner of
writing is very peculiar being neither from the left to the right like
the europeans nor from the right to the left like the arabians nor
from up to down like the chinese but aslant from one corner of the
paper to the other like ladies in england
they bury their dead with their heads directly downward because they
hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise
again in which period the earth which they conceive to be flat will
turn upside down and by this means they shall at their resurrection be
found ready standing on their feet the learned among them confess the
absurdity of this doctrine but the practice still continues in
there are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar and if they
were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country i should
be tempted to say a little in their justification it is only to be
wished they were as well executed the first i shall mention relates to
informers all crimes against the state are punished here with the
utmost severity but if the person accused makes his innocence plainly
to appear upon his trial the accuser is immediately put to an
ignominious death and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is
quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time for the danger he
underwent for the hardship of his imprisonment and for all the charges
he has been at in making his defence or if that fund be deficient it
is largely supplied by the crown the emperor also confers on him some
public mark of his favour and proclamation is made of his innocence
they look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft and therefore seldom
fail to punish it with death for they allege that care and vigilance
with a very common understanding may preserve a mans goods from
thieves but honesty has no defence against superior cunning and since
it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying
and selling and dealing upon credit where fraud is permitted and
connived at or has no law to punish it the honest dealer is always
undone and the knave gets the advantage i remember when i was once
interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of
a great sum of money which he had received by order and ran away with
and happening to tell his majesty by way of extenuation that it was
only a breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer
as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime and truly i had
little to say in return farther than the common answer that different
nations had different customs for i confess i was heartily ashamed
although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which
all government turns yet i could never observe this maxim to be put in
practice by any nation except that of lilliput whoever can there bring
sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country
for seventy three moons has a claim to certain privileges according to
his quality or condition of life with a proportionable sum of money out
of a fund appropriated for that use he likewise acquires the title of
snilpall or legal which is added to his name but does not descend to
his posterity and these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy
among us when i told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties
without any mention of reward it is upon this account that the image of
justice in their courts of judicature is formed with six eyes two
before as many behind and on each side one to signify circumspection
with a bag of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheathed in her
left to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish
in choosing persons for all employments they have more regard to good
morals than to great abilities for since government is necessary to
mankind they believe that the common size of human understanding is
fitted to some station or other and that providence never intended to
make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only
by a few persons of sublime genius of which there seldom are three born
in an age but they suppose truth justice temperance and the like to
be in every mans power the practice of which virtues assisted by
experience and a good intention would qualify any man for the service of
his country except where a course of study is required but they
thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by
superior endowments of the mind that employments could never be put into
such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified and at least
that the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous disposition
would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal as the
practices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt and who had
great abilities to manage to multiply and defend his corruptions
in like manner the disbelief of a divine providence renders a man
incapable of holding any public station for since kings avow themselves
to be the deputies of providence the lilliputians think nothing can be
more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority
in relating these and the following laws i would only be understood to
mean the original institutions and not the most scandalous corruptions
into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man for
as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on
the ropes or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and
creeping under them the reader is to observe that they were first
introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning and grew to
the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction
ingratitude is among them a capital crime as we read it to have been in
some other countries for they reason thus that whoever makes ill
returns to his benefactor must needs be a common enemy to the rest of
mankind from whom he has received no obligation and therefore such a
their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ
extremely from ours for since the conjunction of male and female is
founded upon the great law of nature in order to propagate and continue
the species the lilliputians will needs have it that men and women are
joined together like other animals by the motives of concupiscence and
that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural
principle for which reason they will never allow that a child is under
any obligation to his father for begetting him or to his mother for
bringing him into the world which considering the miseries of human
life was neither a benefit in itself nor intended so by his parents
whose thoughts in their love encounters were otherwise employed upon
these and the like reasonings their opinion is that parents are the
last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own
children and therefore they have in every town public nurseries where
all parents except cottagers and labourers are obliged to send their
infants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the
age of twenty moons at which time they are supposed to have some
rudiments of docility these schools are of several kinds suited to
different qualities and both sexes they have certain professors well
skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the
rank of their parents and their own capacities as well as inclinations
i shall first say something of the male nurseries and then of the
the nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with
grave and learned professors and their several deputies the clothes
and food of the children are plain and simple they are bred up in the
principles of honour justice courage modesty clemency religion and
love of their country they are always employed in some business except
in the times of eating and sleeping which are very short and two hours
for diversions consisting of bodily exercises they are dressed by men
till four years of age and then are obliged to dress themselves
although their quality be ever so great and the women attendant who are
aged proportionably to ours at fifty perform only the most menial
offices they are never suffered to converse with servants but go
together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions and
always in the presence of a professor or one of his deputies whereby
they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which our
children are subject their parents are suffered to see them only twice
a year the visit is to last but an hour they are allowed to kiss the
child at meeting and parting but a professor who always stands by on
those occasions will not suffer them to whisper or use any fondling
expressions or bring any presents of toys sweetmeats and the like
the pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a
child upon failure of due payment is levied by the emperors officers
the nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen merchants traders and
handicrafts are managed proportionably after the same manner only those
designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old whereas
those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen
which answers to twenty one with us but the confinement is gradually
in the female nurseries the young girls of quality are educated much
like the males only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own
sex but always in the presence of a professor or deputy till they come
to dress themselves which is at five years old and if it be found that
these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or
foolish stories or the common follies practised by chambermaids among
us they are publicly whipped thrice about the city imprisoned for a
year and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country
thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as
the men and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency and
cleanliness neither did i perceive any difference in their education
made by their difference of sex only that the exercises of the females
were not altogether so robust and that some rules were given them
relating to domestic life and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined
them for their maxim is that among peoples of quality a wife should be
always a reasonable and agreeable companion because she cannot always be
young when the girls are twelve years old which among them is the
marriageable age their parents or guardians take them home with great
expressions of gratitude to the professors and seldom without tears of
in the nurseries of females of the meaner sort the children are
instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex and their several
degrees those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old
the meaner families who have children at these nurseries are obliged
besides their annual pension which is as low as possible to return to
the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings to be
a portion for the child and therefore all parents are limited in their
expenses by the law for the lilliputians think nothing can be more
unjust than for people in subservience to their own appetites to bring
children into the world and leave the burthen of supporting them on the
public as to persons of quality they give security to appropriate a
certain sum for each child suitable to their condition and these funds
are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice
the cottagers and labourers keep their children at home their business
being only to till and cultivate the earth and therefore their education
is of little consequence to the public but the old and diseased among
them are supported by hospitals for begging is a trade unknown in this
and here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some account
of my domestics and my manner of living in this country during a
residence of nine months and thirteen days having a head mechanically
turned and being likewise forced by necessity i had made for myself a
table and chair convenient enough out of the largest trees in the royal
park two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts and
linen for my bed and table all of the strongest and coarsest kind they
could get which however they were forced to quilt together in several
folds for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn their linen is
usually three inches wide and three feet make a piece the sempstresses
took my measure as i lay on the ground one standing at my neck and
another at my mid leg with a strong cord extended that each held by the
end while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch
long then they measured my right thumb and desired no more for by a
mathematical computation that twice round the thumb is once round the
wrist and so on to the neck and the waist and by the help of my old
shirt which i displayed on the ground before them for a pattern they
fitted me exactly three hundred tailors were employed in the same
manner to make me clothes but they had another contrivance for taking my
measure i kneeled down and they raised a ladder from the ground to my
neck upon this ladder one of them mounted and let fall a plumb line
from my collar to the floor which just answered the length of my coat
but my waist and arms i measured myself when my clothes were finished
which was done in my house for the largest of theirs would not have been
able to hold them they looked like the patch work made by the ladies in
england only that mine were all of a colour
i had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals in little convenient huts
built about my house where they and their families lived and prepared
me two dishes a piece i took up twenty waiters in my hand and placed
them on the table a hundred more attended below on the ground some with
dishes of meat and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on
their shoulders all which the waiters above drew up as i wanted in a
very ingenious manner by certain cords as we draw the bucket up a well
in europe a dish of their meat was a good mouthful and a barrel of
their liquor a reasonable draught their mutton yields to ours but
their beef is excellent i have had a sirloin so large that i have been
forced to make three bites of it but this is rare my servants were
astonished to see me eat it bones and all as in our country we do the
leg of a lark their geese and turkeys i usually ate at a mouthful and
i confess they far exceed ours of their smaller fowl i could take up
twenty or thirty at the end of my knife
one day his imperial majesty being informed of my way of living desired
that himself and his royal consort with the young princes of the blood
of both sexes might have the happiness as he was pleased to call it
of dining with me they came accordingly and i placed them in chairs
of state upon my table just over against me with their guards about
them flimnap the lord high treasurer attended there likewise with his
white staff and i observed he often looked on me with a sour
countenance which i would not seem to regard but ate more than usual
in honour to my dear country as well as to fill the court with
admiration i have some private reasons to believe that this visit from
his majesty gave flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his
master that minister had always been my secret enemy though he
outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his
nature he represented to the emperor the low condition of his
treasury that he was forced to take up money at a great discount that
exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent below par that
i had cost his majesty above a million and a half of sprugs their
greatest gold coin about the bigness of a spangle and upon the whole
that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion
i am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady who
was an innocent sufferer upon my account the treasurer took a fancy to
be jealous of his wife from the malice of some evil tongues who
informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person
and the court scandal ran for some time that she once came privately to
my lodging this i solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood
without any grounds further than that her grace was pleased to treat me
with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship i own she came often
to my house but always publicly nor ever without three more in the
coach who were usually her sister and young daughter and some
particular acquaintance but this was common to many other ladies of the
court and i still appeal to my servants round whether they at any time
saw a coach at my door without knowing what persons were in it on
those occasions when a servant had given me notice my custom was to go
immediately to the door and after paying my respects to take up the
coach and two horses very carefully in my hands for if there were six
horses the postillion always unharnessed four and place them on a
table where i had fixed a movable rim quite round of five inches high
to prevent accidents and i have often had four coaches and horses at
once on my table full of company while i sat in my chair leaning my
face towards them and when i was engaged with one set the coachmen
would gently drive the others round my table i have passed many an
afternoon very agreeably in these conversations but i defy the
treasurer or his two informers i will name them and let them make the
best of it clustril and drunlo to prove that any person ever came to me
incognito except the secretary reldresal who was sent by express
command of his imperial majesty as i have before related i should not
have dwelt so long upon this particular if it had not been a point
wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned to say
nothing of my own though i then had the honour to be a nardac which
the treasurer himself is not for all the world knows that he is only a
glumglum a title inferior by one degree as that of a marquis is to a
duke in england yet i allow he preceded me in right of his post these
false informations which i afterwards came to the knowledge of by an
accident not proper to mention made the treasurer show his lady for some
time an ill countenance and me a worse and although he was at last
undeceived and reconciled to her yet i lost all credit with him and
found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself who was
the author being informed of a design to accuse him of high treason
makes his escape to blefuscu his reception there
before i proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom it may be
proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two
i had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts for which i was
unqualified by the meanness of my condition i had indeed heard and read
enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers but never
expected to have found such terrible effects of them in so remote a
country governed as i thought by very different maxims from those in
when i was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of
blefuscu a considerable person at court to whom i had been very
serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his
imperial majesty came to my house very privately at night in a close
chair and without sending his name desired admittance the chairmen
were dismissed i put the chair with his lordship in it into my
coat pocket and giving orders to a trusty servant to say i was
indisposed and gone to sleep i fastened the door of my house placed the
chair on the table according to my usual custom and sat down by it
after the common salutations were over observing his lordships
countenance full of concern and inquiring into the reason he desired i
would hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honour
and my life his speech was to the following effect for i took notes
of it as soon as he left me
you are to know said he that several committees of council have been
lately called in the most private manner on your account and it is but
two days since his majesty came to a full resolution
you are very sensible that skyresh bolgolam galbet or high admiral
has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival his
original reasons i know not but his hatred is increased since your great
success against blefuscu by which his glory as admiral is much obscured
this lord in conjunction with flimnap the high treasurer whose enmity
against you is notorious on account of his lady limtoc the general
lalcon the chamberlain and balmuff the grand justiciary have prepared
articles of impeachment against you for treason and other capital
this preface made me so impatient being conscious of my own merits and
innocence that i was going to interrupt him when he entreated me to be
out of gratitude for the favours you have done me i procured
information of the whole proceedings and a copy of the articles wherein
whereas by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty
calin deffar plune it is enacted that whoever shall make water
within the precincts of the royal palace shall be liable to the
pains and penalties of high treason notwithstanding the said
quinbus flestrin in open breach of the said law under colour of
extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majestys most
dear imperial consort did maliciously traitorously and devilishly
by discharge of his urine put out the said fire kindled in the said
apartment lying and being within the precincts of the said royal
palace against the statute in that case provided etc against the
that the said quinbus flestrin having brought the imperial fleet
of blefuscu into the royal port and being afterwards commanded by
his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire
of blefuscu and reduce that empire to a province to be governed by
a viceroy from hence and to destroy and put to death not only all
the big endian exiles but likewise all the people of that empire who
would not immediately forsake the big endian heresy he the said
flestrin like a false traitor against his most auspicious serene
imperial majesty did petition to be excused from the said service
upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences or destroy
the liberties and lives of an innocent people
that whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the court of
blefuscu to sue for peace in his majestys court he the said
flestrin did like a false traitor aid abet comfort and divert
the said ambassadors although he knew them to be servants to a
prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty and in
that the said quinbus flestrin contrary to the duty of a faithful
subject is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of
blefuscu for which he has received only verbal license from his
imperial majesty and under colour of the said license does falsely
and traitorously intend to take the said voyage and thereby to aid
comfort and abet the emperor of blefuscu so lately an enemy and in
there are some other articles but these are the most important of
in the several debates upon this impeachment it must be confessed that
his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity often urging the
services you had done him and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes
the treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most
painful and ignominious death by setting fire to your house at night
and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men armed with
poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands some of your
servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your
shirts and sheets which would soon make you tear your own flesh and die
in the utmost torture the general came into the same opinion so that
for a long time there was a majority against you but his majesty
resolving if possible to spare your life at last brought off the
upon this incident reldresal principal secretary for private affairs
who always approved himself your true friend was commanded by the
emperor to deliver his opinion which he accordingly did and therein
justified the good thoughts you have of him he allowed your crimes to
be great but that still there was room for mercy the most commendable
virtue in a prince and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated
he said the friendship between you and him was so well known to the
world that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial
however in obedience to the command he had received he would freely
offer his sentiments that if his majesty in consideration of your
services and pursuant to his own merciful disposition would please to
spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes he
humbly conceived that by this expedient justice might in some measure be
satisfied and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor as
well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to
be his counsellors that the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to
your bodily strength by which you might still be useful to his majesty
that blindness is an addition to courage by concealing dangers from us
that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in
bringing over the enemys fleet and it would be sufficient for you to
see by the eyes of the ministers since the greatest princes do no more
this proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole
board bolgolam the admiral could not preserve his temper but rising
up in fury said he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his
opinion for preserving the life of a traitor that the services you had
performed were by all true reasons of state the great aggravation of
your crimes that you who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge
of urine in her majestys apartment which he mentioned with horror
