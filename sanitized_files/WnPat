earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this station
but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of
indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest
the postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling torzhok
embroidery came into the room offering their services without changing
his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable
to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without
having solved the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossed
by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from sokolniki after
the duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night but now
in the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force no
matter what he thought about he always returned to these same questions
which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself it was
as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were
stripped so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turning
the postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellency
have the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wanted
is this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for me bad for
another traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needs
money for food the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing
for letting a private traveler have the courier horses but the officer
thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible and i
continued pierre shot dolokhov because i considered myself injured
and louis xvi was executed because they considered him a criminal and a
year later they executed those who executed him also for some reason
what is bad what is good what should one love and what hate what does
one live for and what am i what is life and what is death what power
there was no answer to any of these questions except one and that not
a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer was youll
die and all will end youll die and know all or cease asking but
the torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering her
wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds of
rubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in her tattered
cloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she want the
money for as if that money could add a hairs breadth to happiness or
peace of mind can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to
evil and death death which ends all and must come today or tomorrow
at any rate in an instant as compared with eternity and again he
twisted the screw with the stripped thread and again it turned
his servant handed him a half cut novel in the form of letters by
madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist her
seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put into
her heart an impulse that was against his will my wife as she once
was did not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been found
out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can know
is that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdom
everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and
repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre
i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another
the newcomer was a short large boned yellow faced wrinkled old man
with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who
with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the
aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots
on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeen covered sheepskin
coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with
its broad temples and close cropped hair and looked at bezukhov the
stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he
felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his
eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
deaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as
it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant
was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown
this active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen and
preparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything was
ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a
tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the need
even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this
the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down  with an
unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be
 to indicate he did not want more tea
no give me the book said the stranger
the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional work
and the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all at
once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again
leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former
position with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time to
turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and
pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old
i have the pleasure of addressing count bezukhov if i am not
mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice
pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles
i have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and of your
misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to say yes
misfortune call it what you please i know that what happened to you in
moscow was a misfortune i regret it very much my dear sir
pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile
i have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for
he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way
of inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctant
to enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him
involuntarily came up and sat down beside him
you are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued you are young
and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my power
oh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful to you
the strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but in
spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
but if for reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the old
man say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and
oh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make your
acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangers hands
he looked more closely at the ring with its skull a masonic sign
allow me to ask he said are you a mason
yes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the stranger
looking deeper and deeper into pierres eyes and in their name and my
own i hold out a brotherly hand to you
i am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence
the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own habit of
ridiculing the masonic beliefs i am afraid i am very far from
understanding how am i to put it i am afraid my way of looking at the
world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another
i know your outlook said the mason and the view of life you
mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts
is the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruit
of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if i
had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is a
just as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint
i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the mason
whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness
no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone
with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our
forefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a
worthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed his eyes
i ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in god
said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential to
the mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with
millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poor
man had not the five rubles that would make him happy
yes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason you cannot
know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy
yes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to do
you know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do not
know him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is in thee
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronounced
the mason in a stern and tremulous voice
he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself
if he were not he said quietly you and i would not be speaking of
him my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whom hast thou
denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his
voice who invented him if he did not exist whence came thy
conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didst
thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence of
such an incomprehensible being a being all powerful eternal and
he stopped and remained silent for a long time
pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence
he exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again
looking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves of
his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
still if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i could bring
him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee but how
can i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence his infinity and
all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he may not
see or understand him and may not see or understand his own vileness and
sinfulness he paused again who art thou thou dreamest that thou art
wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he went on
with a somber and scornful smile and thou art more foolish and
unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of a
skillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understand its
use he does not believe in the master who made it to know him is
hard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but in
our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and his
pierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the masons face with
shining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing with
his whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wise
reasoning contained in the masons words or believed as a child
believes in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness or the
tremor of the speakers voice which sometimes almost broke or those
brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm firmness
and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole being and
which struck pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and
hopelessness at any rate pierre longed with his whole soul to believe
and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration
he is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the mason
i do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubts
reawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness in
the masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him i
dont understand he said how it is that the mind of man cannot
the mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile
the highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to
imbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel
and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myself can i
retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive
yes yes that is so said pierre joyfully
the highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those worldly
sciences of physics history chemistry and the like into which
intellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is one the
highest wisdom has but one science the science of the whole the
science explaining the whole creation and mans place in it to receive
that science it is necessary to purify and renew ones inner self and
so before one can know it is necessary to believe and to perfect ones
self and to attain this end we have the light called conscience that
look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask
thyself whether thou art content with thyself what hast thou attained
relying on reason only what art thou you are young you are rich you
are clever you are well educated and what have you done with all these
good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life
no i hate my life pierre muttered wincing
thou hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou art
purified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sir how
have you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receiving
everything from society and giving nothing in return you have become
the possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you done for
your neighbor have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of
slaves have you helped them physically and morally no you have
profited by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you have
done have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
neighbor no you have spent your life in idleness then you married my
dear sir took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
woman and what have you done you have not helped her to find the way
of truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
misery a man offended you and you shot him and you say you do not know
god and hate your life there is nothing strange in that my dear sir
after these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse again
leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierre
looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved
his lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a vile idle
vicious life but dared not break the silence
the mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called his
how about the horses he asked without looking at pierre
the exchange horses have just come answered the servant will you
can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
all and without promising to help me thought pierre rising with
downcast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally at
the mason yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptible
and profligate life though i did not like it and did not want to
thought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he wished to
pierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare to the
traveler having packed his things with his practiced hands began
fastening his coat when he had finished he turned to bezukhov and
where are you going to now my dear sir
i im going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlike
hesitating voice i thank you i agree with all you have said but do
not suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be what you
would have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it is i
above all who am to blame for everything help me teach me and
pierre could not go on he gulped and turned away
the mason remained silent for a long time evidently considering
help comes from god alone he said but such measure of help as our
order can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going to
petersburg hand this to count willarski he took out his notebook and
wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four allow me
to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital first of all
devote some time to solitude and self examination and do not resume your
former way of life and now i wish you a good journey my dear sir he
added seeing that his servant had entered and success
the traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from the
postmasters book bazdeev had been one of the best known freemasons and
martinists even in novikovs time for a long while after he had gone
pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room
pondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginning
anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable virtuous future
that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had been vicious
only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous not
a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul he firmly believed in
the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of
supporting one another in the path of virtue and that is how
on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival he
went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas a kempis whose book
had been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually realized
as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing in
the possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility of
active brotherly love among men which joseph alexeevich had revealed to
him a week after his arrival the young polish count willarski whom
pierre had known slightly in petersburg society came into his room one
evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which dolokhovs
second had called on him and having closed the door behind him and
satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressed
i have come to you with a message and an offer count he said without
sitting down a person of very high standing in our brotherhood has
made application for you to be received into our order before the usual
term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor i consider it a sacred
duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish to enter the
the cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before met
at balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women
one more question count he said which i beg you to answer in all
sincerity not as a future mason but as an honest man have you
renounced your former convictions do you believe in god
yes yes i believe in god he said
in that case began willarski but pierre interrupted him
yes i do believe in god he repeated
in that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at your
willarski was silent throughout the drive to pierres inquiries as to
what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied that
brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to
having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its
headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small
well lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a
servant from there they passed into another room a man in strange
attire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward him said
something to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a small
wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
before having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski bound
pierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some hairs
painfully in the knot then he drew his face down kissed him and
taking him by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in the knot hurt
pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile
his huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered though
smiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid steps
having led him about ten paces willarski stopped
whatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfully if
you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre nodded
affirmatively when you hear a knock at the door you will uncover
your eyes added willarski i wish you courage and success and
left alone pierre went on smiling in the same way once or twice he
shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as if
wishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spent
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb his
legs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out he
experienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of what
would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he felt
curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met joseph
alexeevich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandage
off his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darkness
only a small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearer
and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book
the book was the gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
human skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first words
of the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was with
god pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with
something it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at all
surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more
unusual than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the gospel it
seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more trying to
stimulate his emotions he looked around god death love the
brotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating these words
with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in
by the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed he saw
a rather short man having evidently come from the light into the
darkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward the
table and placed on it his small leather gloved hands
this short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
part of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
white ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
for what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in pierres
direction at a slight rustle made by the latter why have you who do
not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light
come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue enlightenment
at the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt a
sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
confession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
stranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with bated
breath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor by which name the
brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was
known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knew
smolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
acquaintance he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor
for a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had to
yes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with difficulty
very well said smolyaninov and went on at once have you any idea
of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your aim
i hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierre
with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
i imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
have virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of
his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke i imagine
good said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answer
have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion
no i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre so
softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
saying i have been an atheist answered pierre
you are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the rhetor
the rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breast
now i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order he said and
if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhood with
profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on which
it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation and
handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has come
down to us from the remotest ages even from the first man a mystery on
which perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since this mystery is of
such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by
long and diligent self purification not everyone can hope to attain it
quickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members as
much as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten their
minds by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven
to attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receiving
by purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improve
the whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety and
virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
sways the world think this over and i will come to you again
to combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a
mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind
he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he
addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself
vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objects
mentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankind
especially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by the
rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential
and the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
half an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons temple
which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were
1 discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order 2 obedience to
those of higher ranks in the order 3 morality 4 love of mankind 5
courage 6 generosity 7 the love of death
in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the
rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but
as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from
this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and
yes that must be so thought pierre when after these words the
rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be so
but i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is only
now gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues which
pierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his
soul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especially
obedience which did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he now
felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
to those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventh
the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre
whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
i must also inform you said the rhetor that our order delivers its
teaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhaps
have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue
than mere words this chamber with what you see therein should already
have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words could
do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method
of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies that
explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said the
rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but
which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol
pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak he
listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that his
if you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetor
coming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give me
but i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was asked
what you have with you watch money rings
pierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage for
some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had been
in token of obedience i ask you to undress
pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to the
rhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierres left
breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to
above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a
slipper for his left foot with a childlike smile of embarrassment
doubt and self derision which appeared on his face against his will
pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before his
and now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chief
my passion i have had so many replied pierre
that passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path
wine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women he
went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to give
women he said in a low scarcely audible voice
the mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
answer at last he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that lay
for the last time i say to you turn all your attention upon yourself
put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but in
your own heart the source of blessedness is not without us but
pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion
soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre not
the rhetor but pierres sponsor willarski whom he recognized by his
voice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierre
replied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smile his
fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and
one booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to his bare
chest he was conducted from that room along passages that turned
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
lodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock with
mallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was still
blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was
born and so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded and
as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
pilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of the
universe and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
dangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken of
now as the seeker now as the sufferer and now as the postulant
to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords as he
was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty
among his conductors he heard those around him disputing in whispers
and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet
after that they took his right hand placed it on something and told
him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand
and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the
laws of the order the candles were then extinguished and some spirit
lighted as pierre knew by the smell and he was told that he would now
see the lesser light the bandage was taken off his eyes and by the
faint light of the burning spirit pierre as in a dream saw several
men standing before him wearing aprons like the rhetors and holding
swords in their hands pointed at his breast among them stood a man
whose white shirt was stained with blood on seeing this pierre moved
forward with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce it
but the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded
now thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then the candles
were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bandage
was again removed and more than ten voices said together sic transit
pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat some
twelve men in garments like those he had already seen some of them
pierre had met in petersburg society in the presidents chair sat a
young man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck
on his right sat the italian abbe whom pierre had met at anna pavlovnas
two years before there were also present a very distinguished dignitary
and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kuragins all maintained
a solemn silence listening to the words of the president who held a
mallet in his hand let into the wall was a star shaped light at one
side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon
it at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a
testament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks like
those used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar
placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that he
must prostrate himself at the gates of the temple
he must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers
pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am i
doing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to remember
this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the
serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gone
through and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast at
his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling
prostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before when
he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leather
apron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a trowel
and three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him he
told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained
trowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice
and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to the
first pair of gloves a mans he said that pierre could not know their
meaning but must keep them the second pair of mans gloves he was to
wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womens
gloves he said dear brother these womans gloves are intended for
you too give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all this
gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to
be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added but
beware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that are
unclean while the grand master said these last words it seemed to
pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still more
confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began
looking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followed
this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to the
rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a
trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows and
so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs of
the lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down the
grand master began reading the statutes they were very long and
pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to
understand what was being read he managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind
in our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grand
master but those between virtue and vice beware of making any
distinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brothers aid whoever
he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth never
bear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteous
kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thy
neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thy
enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfilling
the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tears
of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the
congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them
the grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down in
their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
the grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed and
the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector of alms
went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked to subscribe all
he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same
the meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had
become completely changed and had quite left behind his former habits
the day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting at
home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the square
one side of which symbolized god another moral things a third physical
things and the fourth a combination of these now and then his
attention wandered from the book and the square and he formed in
imagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge he
had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that it
would be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to his
estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs he
was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasili suddenly entered
my dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have you
quarreled with helene mon cher you are under a delusion said prince
vasili as he entered i know all about it and i can tell you
positively that helene is as innocent before you as christ was before
pierre was about to reply but prince vasili interrupted him
and why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i know
all about it and understand it all he said you behaved as becomes a
man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wont go into
that but consider the position in which you are placing her and me in
the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering his
voice she is living in moscow and you are here remember dear boy
and he drew pierres arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding i
expect you feel it so yourself let us write her a letter at once and
shell come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy let me
tell you its quite likely youll have to suffer for it
i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keen
interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to helene
pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasili did
not let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin to speak
in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly
resolved to answer his father in law moreover the words of the masonic
statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him he blinked went
red got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what was
for him the most difficult thing in life to say an unpleasant thing to
a mans face to say what the other whoever he might be did not
expect he was so used to submitting to prince vasilis tone of careless
self assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now but
he also felt that on what he said now his future depended whether he
would follow the same old road or that new path so attractively shown
him by the masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a
now dear boy said prince vasili playfully say yes and ill
write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf
but before prince vasili had finished his playful speech pierre
without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his
prince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up and
go he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
confusion and fear that showed itself on prince vasilis face
whats the matter with you are you ill
go the quivering voice repeated and prince vasili had to go without
a week later pierre having taken leave of his new friends the masons
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to his
estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity
the duel between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up and in spite of the
emperors severity regarding duels at that time neither the principals
nor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the duel confirmed
by pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of society pierre who
had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an
illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best match in
russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage
when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope
from him especially as he did not know how and did not wish to court
societys favor now he alone was blamed for what had happened he was
said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of
bloodthirsty rage and when after pierres departure helene returned to
petersburg she was received by all her acquaintances not only
cordially but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune
when conversation turned on her husband helene assumed a dignified
expression which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she
did not understand its significance this expression suggested that she
had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband
was a cross laid upon her by god prince vasili expressed his opinion
more openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierre was mentioned and
i said from the first declared anna pavlovna referring to pierre i
said at the time and before anyone else she insisted on her priority
that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of
these days i said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures
about him when he had just returned from abroad and when if you
remember he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soirees and how has
it ended i was against this marriage even then and foretold all that
anna pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
soirees as before such as she alone had the gift of arranging at which
was to be found the cream of really good society the bloom of the
intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it besides this
refined selection of society anna pavlovnas receptions were also
distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and
interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state
of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society so
toward the end of 1806 when all the sad details of napoleons
destruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstadt and the surrender
of most of the prussian fortresses had been received when our troops
had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon was
beginning anna pavlovna gave one of her soirees the cream of really
good society consisted of the fascinating helene forsaken by her
husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had just
returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young man
referred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un homme de
beaucoup de merite a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother and
the novelty anna pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was
boris drubetskoy who had just arrived as a special messenger from the
prussian army and was aide de camp to a very important personage
the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
whatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance
bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance and
mortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall not cease
to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to the
king of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu las voulu
george dandin thats all we have to say about it
when boris who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawing
room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guided
by anna pavlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria and
boris grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and self possessed
entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide de
camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then
anna pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description
prince hippolyte kuragin m krug the charge daffaires from
copenhagen a profound intellect and simply mr shitov a man of
great merit this of the man usually so described
thanks to anna mikhaylovnas efforts his own tastes and the
peculiarities of his reserved nature boris had managed during his
service to place himself very advantageously he was aide de camp to a
very important personage had been sent on a very important mission to
prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he had
become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
been so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank
incomparably higher than a general and according to which what was
needed for success in the service was not effort or work or courage or
perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
success and at the inability of others to understand these things in
consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all his
relations with old friends all his plans for his future were
completely altered he was not rich but would spend his last groat to
be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many
pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with and
sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who
could therefore be of use to him he liked petersburg and despised
moscow the remembrance of the rostovs house and of his childish love
for natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the
