who wrote and transacted business and it appears that his household then
consisted of his wife the natural daughter isabel de saavedra already
mentioned his sister andrea now a widow her daughter constanza a
mysterious magdalena de sotomayor calling herself his sister for whom
his biographers cannot account and a servant maid
meanwhile don quixote had been growing in favour and its authors name
was now known beyond the pyrenees in 1607 an edition was printed at
brussels robles the madrid publisher found it necessary to meet the
demand by a third edition the seventh in all in 1608 the popularity of
the book in italy was such that a milan bookseller was led to bring out
an edition in 1610 and another was called for in brussels in 1611 it
might naturally have been expected that with such proofs before him that
he had hit the taste of the public cervantes would have at once set
about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume
but to all appearance nothing was farther from his thoughts he had
still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had
inserted in don quixote and instead of continuing the adventures of don
quixote he set to work to write more of these novelas exemplares as he
afterwards called them with a view to making a book of them
the novels were published in the summer of 1613 with a dedication to the
conde de lemos the maecenas of the day and with one of those chatty
confidential prefaces cervantes was so fond of in this eight years and
a half after the first part of don quixote had appeared we get the
first hint of a forthcoming second part you shall see shortly he
says the further exploits of don quixote and humours of sancho panza
his idea of shortly was a somewhat elastic one for as we know by the
date to sanchos letter he had barely one half of the book completed
but more than poems or pastorals or novels it was his dramatic
ambition that engrossed his thoughts the same indomitable spirit that
kept him from despair in the bagnios of algiers and prompted him to
attempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again made him
persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win
the ear of the public as a dramatist the temperament of cervantes was
essentially sanguine the portrait he draws in the preface to the novels
with the aquiline features chestnut hair smooth untroubled forehead
and bright cheerful eyes is the very portrait of a sanguine man nothing
that the managers might say could persuade him that the merits of his
plays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair
chance the old soldier of the spanish salamis was bent on being the
aeschylus of spain he was to found a great national drama based on the
true principles of art that was to be the envy of all nations he was to
drive from the stage the silly childish plays the mirrors of nonsense
and models of folly that were in vogue through the cupidity of the
managers and shortsightedness of the authors he was to correct and
educate the public taste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of
the greek drama like the numancia for instance and comedies that
would not only amuse but improve and instruct all this he was to do
could he once get a hearing there was the initial difficulty
he shows plainly enough too that don quixote and the demolition of
the chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart he was
indeed as he says himself in his preface more a stepfather than a
father to don quixote never was great work so neglected by its author
that it was written carelessly hastily and by fits and starts was not
always his fault but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the
press he knew how the printers had blundered but he never took the
trouble to correct them when the third edition was in progress as a man
who really cared for the child of his brain would have done he appears
to have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de
entretenimiento an amusing book a thing as he says in the viaje to
divert the melancholy moody heart at any time or season no doubt he had
an affection for his hero and was very proud of sancho panza it would
have been strange indeed if he had not been proud of the most humorous
creation in all fiction he was proud too of the popularity and success
of the book and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he
shows his pride in a dozen passages in the second part but it was not
the success he coveted in all probability he would have given all the
success of don quixote nay would have seen every copy of don
quixote burned in the plaza mayor for one such success as lope de vega
was enjoying on an average once a week
and so he went on dawdling over don quixote adding a chapter now and
again and putting it aside to turn to persiles and sigismunda which
as we know was to be the most entertaining book in the language and the
rival of theagenes and chariclea or finishing off one of his darling
comedies and if robles asked when don quixote would be ready the
answer no doubt was en breve shortly there was time enough for that at
sixty eight he was as full of life and hope and plans for the future as a
nemesis was coming however he had got as far as chapter lix which at
his leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before october or
november 1614 when there was put into his hand a small octave lately
printed at tarragona and calling itself second volume of the ingenious
gentleman don quixote of la mancha by the licentiate alonso fernandez de
avellaneda of tordesillas the last half of chapter lix and most of the
following chapters of the second part give us some idea of the effect
produced upon him and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by
the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself had avellaneda
in fact been content with merely bringing out a continuation to don
quixote cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance his own
intentions were expressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the
book nay in his last words forse altro cantera con miglior plettro
he seems actually to invite some one else to continue the work and he
made no sign until eight years and a half had gone by by which time
in fact cervantes had no case or a very bad one as far as the mere
continuation was concerned but avellaneda chose to write a preface to
it full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill conditioned man
could pour out he taunts cervantes with being old with having lost his
hand with having been in prison with being poor with being friendless
accuses him of envy of lopes success of petulance and querulousness
and so on and it was in this that the sting lay avellanedas reason for
this personal attack is obvious enough whoever he may have been it is
clear that he was one of the dramatists of lopes school for he has the
impudence to charge cervantes with attacking him as well as lope in his
criticism on the drama his identification has exercised the best critics
and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear
on it navarrete and ticknor both incline to the belief that cervantes
knew who he was but i must say i think the anger he shows suggests an
invisible assailant it is like the irritation of a man stung by a
mosquito in the dark cervantes from certain solecisms of language
pronounces him to be an aragonese and pellicer an aragonese himself
supports this view and believes him moreover to have been an
any merit avellaneda has is reflected from cervantes and he is too dull
to reflect much dull and dirty will always be i imagine the verdict
of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers he is at best a poor
plagiarist all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by
cervantes his only humour lies in making don quixote take inns for
castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage and
sancho mistake words invert proverbs and display his gluttony all
through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt and he has
contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth
but whatever avellaneda and his book may be we must not forget the debt
we owe them but for them there can be no doubt don quixote would
have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work even if
cervantes had finished the volume he had in hand most assuredly he would
have left off with a promise of a third part giving the further
adventures of don quixote and humours of sancho panza as shepherds it is
plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral
romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry and but for
avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out but it is more likely
that with his plans and projects and hopefulness the volume would
have remained unfinished till his death and that we should have never
made the acquaintance of the duke and duchess or gone with sancho to
from the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been
haunted by the fear that there might be more avellanedas in the field
and putting everything else aside he set himself to finish off his task
and protect don quixote in the only way he could by killing him the
conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work
and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to avellaneda
becomes in the end rather wearisome but it is at any rate a conclusion
the new volume was ready for the press in february but was not printed
till the very end of 1615 and during the interval cervantes put together
the comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years
and as he adds plaintively found no demand for among the managers and
published them with a preface worth the book it introduces tenfold in
which he gives an account of the early spanish stage and of his own
attempts as a dramatist it is needless to say they were put forward by
cervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits the
reader however was not to suppose they were his last word or final
effort in the drama for he had in hand a comedy called engano a los
ojos about which if he mistook not there would be no question
of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging his
health had been failing for some time and he died apparently of dropsy
on the 23rd of april 1616 the day on which england lost shakespeare
nominally at least for the english calendar had not yet been reformed
he died as he had lived accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully
was it an unhappy life that of cervantes his biographers all tell us
that it was but i must say i doubt it it was a hard life a life of
poverty of incessant struggle of toil ill paid of disappointment but
cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils his was
not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue
of their own buoyancy it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he
was proof against it it is impossible to conceive cervantes giving way
to despondency or prostrated by dejection as for poverty it was with
him a thing to be laughed over and the only sigh he ever allows to
escape him is when he says happy he to whom heaven has given a piece of
bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but heaven itself
add to all this his vital energy and mental activity his restless
invention and his sanguine temperament and there will be reason enough
to doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life he who could
take cervantes distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them
would not make so bad a bargain perhaps as far as happiness in life is
of his burial place nothing is known except that he was buried in
accordance with his will in the neighbouring convent of trinitarian
nuns of which it is supposed his daughter isabel de saavedra was an
inmate and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another
convent carrying their dead with them but whether the remains of
cervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows and the clue
to their resting place is now lost beyond all hope this furnishes
perhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect
brought against his contemporaries in some of the others there is a good
deal of exaggeration to listen to most of his biographers one would
suppose that all spain was in league not only against the man but against
his memory or at least that it was insensible to his merits and left
him to live in misery and die of want to talk of his hard life and
unworthy employments in andalusia is absurd what had he done to
distinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning a
precarious livelihood true he was a gallant soldier who had been
wounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his countrys cause
but there were hundreds of others in the same case he had written a
mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance and some plays which
manifestly did not comply with the primary condition of pleasing were
the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse them because the
author was to produce don quixote twenty years afterwards
the scramble for copies which as we have seen followed immediately on
the appearance of the book does not look like general insensibility to
its merits no doubt it was received coldly by some but if a man writes
a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldly
received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of
wigmakers if cervantes had the chivalry romance readers the
sentimentalists the dramatists and the poets of the period all against
him it was because don quixote was what it was and if the general
public did not come forward to make him comfortable for the rest of his
days it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the
english speaking public that did not pay off scotts liabilities it did
the best it could it read his book and liked it and bought it and
encouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others
it has been also made a reproach to spain that she has erected no
monument to the man she is proudest of no monument that is to say of
him for the bronze statue in the little garden of the plaza de las
cortes a fair work of art no doubt and unexceptionable had it been set
up to the local poet in the market place of some provincial town is not
worthy of cervantes or of madrid but what need has cervantes of such
weak witness of his name or what could a monument do in his case except
testify to the self glorification of those who had put it up si
monumentum quoeris circumspice the nearest booksellers shop will show
what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of don quixote
nine editions of the first part of don quixote had already appeared
before cervantes died thirty thousand copies in all according to his
own estimate and a tenth was printed at barcelona the year after his
death so large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time but
by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted and from that time down to the
present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and
regularly the translations show still more clearly in what request the
book has been from the very outset in seven years from the completion of
the work it had been translated into the four leading languages of
europe except the bible in fact no book has been so widely diffused as
don quixote the imitatio christi may have been translated into as
many different languages and perhaps robinson crusoe and the vicar of
wakefield into nearly as many but in multiplicity of translations and
editions don quixote leaves them all far behind
still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion don
quixote has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about
knight errantry if they had any at all were of the vaguest who had
never seen or heard of a book of chivalry who could not possibly feel
the humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the authors purpose
another curious fact is that this the most cosmopolitan book in the
world is one of the most intensely national manon lescaut is not more
thoroughly french tom jones not more english rob roy not more
scotch than don quixote is spanish in character in ideas in
sentiment in local colour in everything what then is the secret of
this unparalleled popularity increasing year by year for well nigh three
centuries one explanation no doubt is that of all the books in the
world don quixote is the most catholic there is something in it for
every sort of reader young or old sage or simple high or low as
cervantes himself says with a touch of pride it is thumbed and read and
got by heart by people of all sorts the children turn its leaves the
young people read it the grown men understand it the old folk praise
but it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which more than its
humour or its wisdom or the fertility of invention or knowledge of
human nature it displays has insured its success with the multitude is
the vein of farce that runs through it it was the attack upon the sheep
the battle with the wine skins mambrinos helmet the balsam of
fierabras don quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill sancho
tossed in the blanket the mishaps and misadventures of master and man
that were originally the great attraction and perhaps are so still to
some extent with the majority of readers it is plain that don quixote
was generally regarded at first and indeed in spain for a long time as
little more than a queer droll book full of laughable incidents and
absurd situations very amusing but not entitled to much consideration
or care all the editions printed in spain from 1637 to 1771 when the
famous printer ibarra took it up were mere trade editions badly and
carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap books
intended only for popular use with in most instances uncouth
illustrations and clap trap additions by the publisher
to england belongs the credit of having been the first country to
recognise the right of don quixote to better treatment than this the
london edition of 1738 commonly called lord carterets from having been
suggested by him was not a mere edition de luxe it produced don
quixote in becoming form as regards paper and type and embellished with
plates which if not particularly happy as illustrations were at least
well intentioned and well executed but it also aimed at correctness of
text a matter to which nobody except the editors of the valencia and
brussels editions had given even a passing thought and for a first
attempt it was fairly successful for though some of its emendations are
inadmissible a good many of them have been adopted by all subsequent
the zeal of publishers editors and annotators brought about a
remarkable change of sentiment with regard to don quixote a vast
number of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it it
became almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book the humour was not
entirely denied but according to the new view it was rated as an
altogether secondary quality a mere accessory nothing more than the
stalking horse under the presentation of which cervantes shot his
philosophy or his satire or whatever it was he meant to shoot for on
this point opinions varied all were agreed however that the object he
aimed at was not the books of chivalry he said emphatically in the
preface to the first part and in the last sentence of the second that he
had no other object in view than to discredit these books and this to
advanced criticism made it clear that his object must have been
one theory was that the book was a kind of allegory setting forth the
eternal struggle between the ideal and the real between the spirit of
poetry and the spirit of prose and perhaps german philosophy never
evolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its inner
consciousness something of the antagonism no doubt is to be found in
don quixote because it is to be found everywhere in life and
cervantes drew from life it is difficult to imagine a community in which
the never ceasing game of cross purposes between sancho panza and don
quixote would not be recognized as true to nature in the stone age
among the lake dwellers among the cave men there were don quixotes and
sancho panzas there must have been the troglodyte who never could see
the facts before his eyes and the troglodyte who could see nothing else
but to suppose cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such
idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very
unlike the age in which he lived but altogether unlike cervantes
himself who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort
the extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is
quite enough to account for the genesis of the book some idea of the
prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth
century may be obtained from the scrutiny of chapter vii if the reader
bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the
largest group are enumerated as to its effect upon the nation there is
abundant evidence from the time when the amadises and palmerins began to
grow popular down to the very end of the century there is a steady
stream of invective from men whose character and position lend weight to
their words against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of
their readers ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust
that this was the task cervantes set himself and that he had ample
provocation to urge him to it will be sufficiently clear to those who
look into the evidence as it will be also that it was not chivalry
itself that he attacked and swept away of all the absurdities that
thanks to poetry will be repeated to the end of time there is no
greater one than saying that cervantes smiled spains chivalry away in
the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away spains
chivalry had been dead for more than a century its work was done when
granada fell and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature
it could not live under the rule that ferdinand substituted for the free
institutions of mediaeval spain what he did smile away was not chivalry
the true nature of the right arm and the bright array before which
according to the poet the world gave ground and which cervantes
single laugh demolished may be gathered from the words of one of his own
countrymen don felix pacheco as reported by captain george carleton in
his military memoirs from 1672 to 1713 before the appearance in the
world of that labour of cervantes he said it was next to an
impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without
danger there were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before
the windows of their mistresses that a stranger would have imagined the
whole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight errants but
after the world became a little acquainted with that notable history the
man that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a don
quixote and found himself the jest of high and low and i verily believe
that to this and this only we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit
which has run through all our councils for a century past so little
agreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors
to call don quixote a sad book preaching a pessimist view of life
argues a total misconception of its drift it would be so if its moral
were that in this world true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and
discomfiture but it preaches nothing of the sort its moral so far as
it can be said to have one is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born
of vanity and self conceit that is made an end in itself not a means to
an end that acts on mere impulse regardless of circumstances and
consequences is mischievous to its owner and a very considerable
nuisance to the community at large to those who cannot distinguish
between the one kind and the other no doubt don quixote is a sad book
no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so
beautiful a sentiment as that it is a hard case to make slaves of those
whom god and nature made free should be ungratefully pelted by the
scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society but to others
of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless
self sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for
all the mischief it does in the world
a very slight examination of the structure of don quixote will suffice
to show that cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind
when he began the book when he wrote those lines in which with a few
strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman he had
no idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him there can
be little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with
those he had already written a tale setting forth the ludicrous results
that might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act
the part of a knight errant in modern life
it is plain for one thing that sancho panza did not enter into the
original scheme for had cervantes thought of him he certainly would not
have omitted him in his heros outfit which he obviously meant to be
complete him we owe to the landlords chance remark in chapter iii that
knights seldom travelled without squires to try to think of a don
quixote without sancho panza is like trying to think of a one bladed pair
the story was written at first like the others without any division and
without the intervention of cide hamete benengeli and it seems not
unlikely that cervantes had some intention of bringing dulcinea or
aldonza lorenzo on the scene in person it was probably the ransacking
of the dons library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that
first suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development what
if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures he were to make
his tale a burlesque of one of these books caricaturing their style
in pursuance of this change of plan he hastily and somewhat clumsily
divided what he had written into chapters on the model of amadis
invented the fable of a mysterious arabic manuscript and set up cide
hamete benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the
chivalry romance authors who were fond of tracing their books to some
recondite source in working out the new ideas he soon found the value
of sancho panza indeed the keynote not only to sanchos part but to
the whole book is struck in the first words sancho utters when he
announces his intention of taking his ass with him about the ass we
are told don quixote hesitated a little trying whether he could call
to mind any knight errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass back
but no instance occurred to his memory we can see the whole scene at a
glance the stolid unconsciousness of sancho and the perplexity of his
master upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself
this is sanchos mission throughout the book he is an unconscious
mephistopheles always unwittingly making mockery of his masters
aspirations always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some
unintentional ad absurdum always bringing him back to the world of fact
by the time cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands and
summoned up resolution enough to set about the second part in earnest
the case was very much altered don quixote and sancho panza had not
merely found favour but had already become what they have never since
ceased to be veritable entities to the popular imagination there was no
occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter nay his readers
told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more don quixote and
more sancho panza and not novels tales or digressions to himself
too his creations had become realities and he had become proud of them
especially of sancho he began the second part therefore under very
different conditions and the difference makes itself manifest at once
even in translation the style will be seen to be far easier more
flowing more natural and more like that of a man sure of himself and of
his audience don quixote and sancho undergo a change also in the first
part don quixote has no character or individuality whatever he is
nothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the
chivalry romances in all that he says and does he is simply repeating
the lesson he has learned from his books and therefore it is absurd to
speak of him in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they
dilate upon his nobleness disinterestedness dauntless courage and so
forth it was the business of a knight errant to right wrongs redress
injuries and succour the distressed and this as a matter of course he
makes his business when he takes up the part a knight errant was bound
to be intrepid and so he feels bound to cast fear aside of all byrons
melodious nonsense about don quixote the most nonsensical statement is
that t is his virtue makes him mad the exact opposite is the truth
in the second part cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader as if it was
a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake that his
heros madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of
chivalry and that on every other subject he is discreto one in fact
whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order the advantage of this
is that he is enabled to make use of don quixote as a mouthpiece for his
own reflections and so without seeming to digress allow himself the
relief of digression when he requires it as freely as in a commonplace
it is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon don quixote is not
very great there are some natural touches of character about him such
as his mixture of irascibility and placability and his curious affection
for sancho together with his impatience of the squires loquacity and
impertinence but in the main apart from his craze he is little more
than a thoughtful cultured gentleman with instinctive good taste and a
great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind
as to sancho it is plain from the concluding words of the preface to
the first part that he was a favourite with his creator even before he
had been taken into favour by the public an inferior genius taking him
in hand a second time would very likely have tried to improve him by
making him more comical clever amiable or virtuous but cervantes was
too true an artist to spoil his work in this way sancho when he
reappears is the old sancho with the old familiar features but with a
difference they have been brought out more distinctly but at the same
time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature the outline
has been filled in where filling in was necessary and vivified by a few
touches of a masters hand sancho stands before us as he might in a
character portrait by velazquez he is a much more important and
prominent figure in the second part than in the first indeed it is his
matchless mendacity about dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the
his development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other in the
first part he displays a great natural gift of lying his lies are not of
the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in
like falstaffs they resemble the father that begets them they are
simple homely plump lies plain working lies in short but in the
service of such a master as don quixote he develops rapidly as we see
when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as dulcinea and her
ladies in waiting it is worth noticing how flushed by his success in
this instance he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers
in his account of the journey on clavileno
in the second part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the
chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque enchantments of
the sort travestied in those of dulcinea and the trifaldi and the cave of
montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances and
another distinguishing feature is caricatured in don quixotes blind
adoration of dulcinea in the romances of chivalry love is either a mere
animalism or a fantastic idolatry only a coarse minded man would care to
make merry with the former but to one of cervantes humour the latter
was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule like everything else in
these romances it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of
chivalry but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence
of those masters of hyperbole the provencal poets when a troubadour
professed his readiness to obey his lady in all things he made it
incumbent upon the next comer if he wished to avoid the imputation of
tameness and commonplace to declare himself the slave of her will which
the next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration and so
expressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings
at an auction and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of
love came into being that in time permeated the literature of southern
europe and bore fruit in one direction in the transcendental worship of
beatrice and laura and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found
exponents in writers like feliciano de silva this is what cervantes
deals with in don quixotes passion for dulcinea and in no instance has
he carried out the burlesque more happily by keeping dulcinea in the
background and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very existence
we are left in doubt he invests don quixotes worship of her virtues and
charms with an additional extravagance and gives still more point to the
caricature of the sentiment and language of the romances
one of the great merits of don quixote and one of the qualities that
have secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the
most cosmopolitan of books is its simplicity there are of course
points obvious enough to a spanish seventeenth century audience which do
not immediately strike a reader now a days and cervantes often takes it
for granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only
intelligible to a few for example on many of his readers in spain and
most of his readers out of it the significance of his choice of a
country for his hero is completely lost it would be going too far to say
that no one can thoroughly comprehend don quixote without having seen
la mancha but undoubtedly even a glimpse of la mancha will give an
insight into the meaning of cervantes such as no commentator can give of
all the regions of spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of
romance of all the dull central plateau of the peninsula it is the
dullest tract there is something impressive about the grim solitudes of
estremadura and if the plains of leon and old castile are bald and
dreary they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in
relics of the past but there is no redeeming feature in the manchegan
landscape it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity the
few towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace
there is nothing venerable about them they have not even the
picturesqueness of poverty indeed don quixotes own village
argamasilla has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim
regularity of its streets and houses everything is ignoble the very
windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind
to anyone who knew the country well the mere style and title of don
quixote of la mancha gave the key to the authors meaning at once la
mancha as the knights country and scene of his chivalries is of a piece
with the pasteboard helmet the farm labourer on ass back for a squire
knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero convicts taken for victims of
oppression and the rest of the incongruities between don quixotes world
and the world he lived in between things as he saw them and things as
it is strange that this element of incongruity underlying the whole
humour and purpose of the book should have been so little heeded by the
majority of those who have undertaken to interpret don quixote it has
been completely overlooked for example by the illustrators to be sure
the great majority of the artists who illustrated don quixote knew
nothing whatever of spain to them a venta conveyed no idea but the
abstract one of a roadside inn and they could not therefore do full
justice to the humour of don quixotes misconception in taking it for a
castle or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal
but even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the
full force of the discrepancy take for instance gustave dores drawing
of don quixote watching his armour in the inn yard whether or not the
venta de quesada on the seville road is as tradition maintains the inn
described in don quixote beyond all question it was just such an
inn yard as the one behind it that cervantes had in his minds eye and
it was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive
draw well in the corner that he meant don quixote to deposit his armour
gustave dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever
watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in spain and thereby
entirely misses the point aimed at by cervantes it is the mean prosaic
commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that
gives a significance to don quixotes vigil and the ceremony that
cervantes humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort
the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous it is
the incongruity of sancho in all his ways words and works with the
ideas and aims of his master quite as much as the wonderful vitality and
truth to nature of the character that makes him the most humorous
creation in the whole range of fiction that unsmiling gravity of which
cervantes was the first great master cervantes serious air which
sits naturally on swift alone perhaps of later humourists is essential
to this kind of humour and here again cervantes has suffered at the
hands of his interpreters nothing unless indeed the coarse buffoonery
of phillips could be more out of place in an attempt to represent
cervantes than a flippant would be facetious style like that of
motteuxs version for example or the sprightly jaunty air french
translators sometimes adopt it is the grave matter of factness of the
narrative and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is
saying anything ludicrous anything but the merest commonplace that give
its peculiar flavour to the humour of cervantes his in fact is the
exact opposite of the humour of sterne and the self conscious humourists
even when uncle toby is at his best you are always aware of the man
sterne behind him watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he
is producing cervantes always leaves you alone with don quixote and
sancho he and swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out
of sight or more properly speaking never think about themselves at
all unlike our latter day school of humourists who seem to have revived
the old horse collar method and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque
it is true that to do full justice to spanish humour in any other
language is well nigh an impossibility there is a natural gravity and a
sonorous stateliness about spanish be it ever so colloquial that make
an absurdity doubly absurd and give plausibility to the most
preposterous statement this is what makes sancho panzas drollery the
despair of the conscientious translator sanchos curt comments can never
fall flat but they lose half their flavour when transferred from their
native castilian into any other medium but if foreigners have failed to
do justice to the humour of cervantes they are no worse than his own
countrymen indeed were it not for the spanish peasants relish of don
quixote one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not
looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country
the craze of don quixote seems in some instances to have communicated
itself to his critics making them see things that are not in the book
and run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own
imaginations like a good many critics now a days they forget that
screams are not criticism and that it is only vulgar tastes that are
influenced by strings of superlatives three piled hyperboles and
pompous epithets but what strikes one as particularly strange is that
while they deal in extravagant eulogies and ascribe all manner of
imaginary ideas and qualities to cervantes they show no perception of
the quality that ninety nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate
highest in him and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry
to speak of don quixote as if it were merely a humorous book would be a
manifest misdescription cervantes at times makes it a kind of
commonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms or for the
observations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring
life it is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature
among modern novels there may be here and there more elaborate studies
of character but there is no book richer in individualised character
what coleridge said of shakespeare in minimis is true of cervantes he
never even for the most temporary purpose puts forward a lay figure
there is life and individuality in all his characters however little
they may have to do or however short a time they may be before the
reader samson carrasco the curate teresa panza altisidora even the
two students met on the road to the cave of montesinos all live and move
and have their being and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of
cervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all even poor
maritornes with her deplorable morals has a kind heart of her own and
some faint and distant resemblance to a christian about her and as for
sancho though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him
unless it be a sort of dog like affection for his master who is there
that in his heart does not love him
but it is after all the humour of don quixote that distinguishes it
from all other books of the romance kind it is this that makes it as
one of the most judicial minded of modern critics calls it the best
novel in the world beyond all comparison it is its varied humour
ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as shakespeares or
molieres that has naturalised it in every country where there are
readers and made it a classic in every language that has a literature
to the book of don quixote of la mancha
since heaven it hath not pleased on thee
make a wry face at thee and ask
if that thy roof be made of glass
it shows small wit to pick up stones
thou that didst imitate that life of mine
when i in lonely sadness on the great
thou whose sole beverage was the bitter brine
of thine own tears and who withouten plate
off the bare earth and on earths fruits didst dine
so long as on the round of the fourth sphere
and thy sage author stand without a peer
stout bold expert as eer the world did see
great were my feats eternal fame their meed
in love i proved my truth and loyalty
the hugest giant was a dwarf for me
ever to knighthoods laws gave i good heed
grasped by the forelock yielded to my will
my fortune seems to sit great quixote still
it were a pleasant fancy to suppose so
and londons town to that which shelters thee
of countless charms thy mind and body show so
or him now famous grown thou madst him grow so
thy knight in some dread combat could i see
then would my heavy sorrow turn to joy
none would i envy all would envy me
regard with scorn the sickle and the spade
i envy thee thy dapple and thy name
and those alforjas thou wast wont to stuff
to thee alone the ovid of our spain
does homage with the rustic kiss and cuff
but if i matched him well in weak 
when with a piece of straw so neat
the blind man of his wine he cheat 
if thou art not a peer peer thou hast none
among a thousand peers thou art a peer
nor is there room for one when thou art near
am i oer distant seas condemned to steer
and to fames altars as an offering bear
i cannot be thy rival for thy fame
but though the scythian or the moor to tame
was not thy lot still thou dost rival me
love binds us in a fellowship of woe
my sword was not to be compared with thine
nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine
that smote from east to west as lightnings fly
the rosy east held out did i resign
the bright aurora for whose love i pine
this arm had might the rage of hell to tame
and famous honoured wise she lives in thee
that crazy brain of yours have quite upset
but aught of base or mean hath never yet
been charged by any in reproach to you
your deeds are open proof in all mens view
and for your pains sore drubbings did you get
if still your woe be powerless to move her
in such hard case your comfort let it be
a booby he hard hearted she and you no lover
b how comes it rocinante youre so lean
b but what becomes of all the hay and corn
r my master gives me none hes much too mean
b come come you show ill breeding sir i ween
t is like an ass your master thus to scorn
r he is an ass will die an ass an ass was born
why hes in love whats whats plainer to be seen
b to be in love is folly r no great sense
b youre metaphysical r from want of food
b rail at the squire then r why whats the good
i might indeed complain of him i grant ye
idle reader thou mayest believe me without any oath that i would this
book as it is the child of my brain were the fairest gayest and
cleverest that could be imagined but i could not counteract natures law
that everything shall beget its like and what then could this sterile
illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry shrivelled whimsical
offspring full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any
other imagination just what might be begotten in a prison where every
misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling
tranquillity a cheerful retreat pleasant fields bright skies
murmuring brooks peace of mind these are the things that go far to make
even the most barren muses fertile and bring into the world births that
fill it with wonder and delight sometimes when a father has an ugly
loutish son the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does
not see his defects or rather takes them for gifts and charms of mind
and body and talks of them to his friends as wit and grace i
however for though i pass for the father i am but the stepfather to
don quixote have no desire to go with the current of custom or to
implore thee dearest reader almost with tears in my eyes as others do
to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine
thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend thy soul is thine own and
thy will as free as any mans whateer he be thou art in thine own
house and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and thou knowest
the common saying under my cloak i kill the king all which exempts
and frees thee from every consideration and obligation and thou canst
say what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill
or rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it
my wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned
