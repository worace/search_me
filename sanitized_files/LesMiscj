which cannot be lost the human heart indestructible that splendid
phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert
understand this did javert penetrate it did javert account for it
to himself evidently he did not but beneath the pressure of that
he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy in all
this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence it seemed
to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever he was
not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head
up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a
smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible
nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed
linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided
for authority was a plane surface there was no fall in it no
dizziness in its presence javert had never beheld the unknown except
from below the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of
chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the
lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches now javert threw
himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented
what one was dismantled from top to bottom one was disconcerted
absolutely in what could one trust that which had been agreed upon was
giving way what the defect in societys armor could be discovered by
a magnanimous wretch what an honest servitor of the law could suddenly
find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to
escape and the crime of arresting him everything was not settled in
the orders given by the state to the functionary there might be
blind alleys in duty what all this was real was it true that an
ex ruffian weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by
being in the right was this credible were there cases in which the law
should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its excuses yes
that was the state of the case and javert saw it and javert had
touched it and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part
in it these were realities it was abominable that actual facts could
reach such deformity if facts did their duty they would confine
themselves to being proofs of the law facts it is god who sends them
was anarchy then on the point of now descending from on high
thus and in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion
of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this
impression was effaced and society and the human race and the
universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and
terrible feature thus the penal laws the thing judged the force due
to legislation the decrees of the sovereign courts the magistracy
the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal
infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest
political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all
this was rubbish a shapeless mass chaos he himself javert the spy
of order incorruptibility in the service of the police the bull dog
providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at
the summit of all that ruin a man with a green cap on his head and a
halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had
come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul
a violent state if ever such existed there were only two ways of
escaping from it one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore
to his cell the convict from the galleys the other   
javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook
himself with a firm tread towards the station house indicated by a
lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet
on arriving there he saw through the window a sergeant of police and
he entered policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they
open the door of a station house javert mentioned his name showed his
card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on
which a candle was burning on a table lay a pen a leaden inkstand and
paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the
night patrols this table still completed by its straw seated chair
is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably
ornamented with a box wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box
of cardboard filled with red wafers and it forms the lowest stage of
official style it is there that the literature of the state has its
javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write this is what
a few observations for the good of the service
in the first place i beg monsieur le prefet to cast his eyes
secondly prisoners on arriving after examination take off
their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are
being searched many of them cough on their return to prison
thirdly the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police
agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions
it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight
of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause
grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take
fourthly it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison
of the madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair
fifthly in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen
so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand
sixthly the prisoners called barkers who summon the other
prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous
to call his name distinctly this is a theft
seventhly for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the
weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth
eighthly it is annoying for visitors to la force to be
obliged to traverse the boys court in order to reach the parlor
ninthly it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard
relating in the court yard of the prefecture the interrogations put
by the magistrates to prisoners for a gendarme who should be
sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination
tenthly mme henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat
but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse trap
of the secret cells this is unworthy of the conciergerie of a
javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography
not omitting a single comma and making the paper screech under his pen
june 7th 1832 about one oclock in the morning
javert dried the fresh ink on the paper folded it like a letter sealed
it wrote on the back note for the administration left it on the
table and quitted the post the glazed and grated door fell to behind
again he traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay
and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had
abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and
found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving stone of the
parapet he did not appear to have stirred
the darkness was complete it was the sepulchral moment which follows
midnight a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars not a single light
burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets
and quays which could be seen were deserted notre dame and the towers
of the court house seemed features of the night a street lantern
reddened the margin of the quay the outlines of the bridges lay
shapeless in the mist one behind the other recent rains had swollen the
the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated
precisely over the rapids of the seine perpendicularly above that
formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again
javert bent his head and gazed all was black nothing was to be
distinguished a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be
seen at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and
undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one
knows whence and converting it into a snake the light vanished and
all became indistinct once more immensity seemed thrown open there
what lay below was not water it was a gulf the wall of the quay
abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from
sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite nothing was
to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of
the wet stones could be felt a fierce breath rose from this abyss the
flood in the river divined rather than perceived the tragic whispering
of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the
imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of
javert remained motionless for several minutes gazing at this opening
of shadow he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled
attention the water roared all at once he took off his hat and placed
it on the edge of the quay a moment later a tall black figure which
a belated passer by in the distance might have taken for a phantom
appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay bent over towards the
seine then drew itself up again and fell straight down into the
shadows a dull splash followed and the shadow alone was in the secret
of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath
chapter i in which the tree with the zinc plaster appears again
some time after the events which we have just recorded sieur
sieur boulatruelle was that road mender of montfermeil whom the reader
has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book
boulatruelle as the reader may perchance recall was a man who
was occupied with divers and troublesome matters he broke stones and
road mender and thief as he was he cherished one dream he believed in
the treasures buried in the forest of montfermeil he hoped some day to
find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree in the meanwhile he
lived to search the pockets of passers by
nevertheless for an instant he was prudent he had just escaped
neatly he had been as the reader is aware picked up in jondrettes
garret in company with the other ruffians utility of a vice his
drunkenness had been his salvation the authorities had never been able
to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a
man who had been robbed an order of nolle prosequi founded on his well
authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush had
set him at liberty he had taken to his heels he had returned to his
road from gagny to lagny to make under administrative supervision
broken stone for the good of the state with downcast mien in a very
pensive mood his ardor for theft somewhat cooled but he was addicted
none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him
as for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after
his return to his road menders turf thatched cot here it is
one morning boulatruelle while on his way as was his wont to his
work and possibly also to his ambush a little before daybreak caught
sight through the branches of the trees of a man whose back alone
he saw but the shape of whose shoulders as it seemed to him at that
distance and in the early dusk was not entirely unfamiliar to him
boulatruelle although intoxicated had a correct and lucid memory a
defensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict
where the deuce have i seen something like that man yonder he said
to himself but he could make himself no answer except that the man
resembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace
however apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch
boulatruelle put things together and made calculations this man did
not belong in the country side he had just arrived there on foot
evidently no public conveyance passes through montfermeil at that hour
he had walked all night whence came he not from a very great distance
for he had neither haversack nor bundle from paris no doubt why was
he in these woods why was he there at such an hour what had he come
boulatruelle thought of the treasure by dint of ransacking his memory
he recalled in a vague way that he had already many years before had
a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect
that he might well be this very individual
by the deuce said boulatruelle ill find him again ill discover
the parish of that parishioner this prowler of patron minette has a
reason and ill know it people cant have secrets in my forest if i
he took his pick axe which was very sharply pointed
there now he grumbled is something that will search the earth and a
and as one knots one thread to another thread he took up the line of
march at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow and
when he had compassed a hundred strides the day which was already
beginning to break came to his assistance footprints stamped in the
sand weeds trodden down here and there heather crushed young branches
in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up
again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who
stretches herself when she wakes pointed out to him a sort of track he
followed it then lost it time was flying he plunged deeper into the
woods and came to a sort of eminence an early huntsman who was passing
in the distance along a path whistling the air of guillery suggested
to him the idea of climbing a tree old as he was he was agile there
stood close at hand a beech tree of great size worthy of tityrus and of
boulatruelle boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able
the idea was a good one on scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side
where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild boulatruelle suddenly
hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him
the man entered or rather glided into an open glade at a
considerable distance masked by large trees but with which
boulatruelle was perfectly familiar on account of having noticed near
a large pile of porous stones an ailing chestnut tree bandaged with
a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark this glade was the one
which was formerly called the blaru bottom the heap of stones destined
for no one knows what employment which was visible there thirty years
ago is doubtless still there nothing equals a heap of stones in
longevity unless it is a board fence they are temporary expedients
boulatruelle with the rapidity of joy dropped rather than descended
from the tree the lair was unearthed the question now was to seize the
beast that famous treasure of his dreams was probably there
it was no small matter to reach that glade by the beaten paths which
indulge in a thousand teasing zigzags it required a good quarter of an
hour in a bee line through the underbrush which is peculiarly dense
very thorny and very aggressive in that locality a full half hour was
necessary boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this
he believed in the straight line a respectable optical illusion which
ruins many a man the thicket bristling as it was struck him as the
lets take to the wolves rue de rivoli said he
boulatruelle accustomed to taking crooked courses was on this occasion
he flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth
he had to deal with holly bushes nettles hawthorns eglantines
thistles and very irascible brambles he was much lacerated
at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to
at last he reached the blaru bottom after the lapse of forty minutes
there was no one in the glade boulatruelle rushed to the heap of
stones it was in its place it had not been carried off
as for the man he had vanished in the forest he had made his escape
where in what direction into what thicket impossible to guess
and heartrending to say there behind the pile of stones in front of
the tree with the sheet of zinc was freshly turned earth a pick axe
thief shrieked boulatruelle shaking his fist at the horizon
chapter ii marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic
for a long time marius was neither dead nor alive for many weeks he
lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral
symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by
he repeated cosettes name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity
of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony the extent of some of
the lesions presented a serious danger the suppuration of large wounds
being always liable to become re absorbed and consequently to kill
the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of
weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy
above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no
emotion the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult
the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been
invented as yet at that epoch nicolette used up a sheet as big as the
ceiling as she put it for lint it was not without difficulty
that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the
gangrene as long as there was any danger m gillenormand seated in
despair at his grandsons pillow was like marius neither alive nor
every day sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with
white hair such was the description given by the porter came to
inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the
finally on the 7th of september four months to a day after the
sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a
dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius
convalescence began but marius was forced to remain for two months more
stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by
the fracture of his collar bone there always is a last wound like that
which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to
however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him
from all pursuit in france there is no wrath not even of a public
character which six months will not extinguish revolts in the present
state of society are so much the fault of every one that they are
followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes
let us add that the inexcusable gisquet order which enjoined doctors
to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public
opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded
were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception
of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the
councils of war did not dare to trouble any one so marius was left in
m gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish and then
through every form of ecstasy it was found difficult to prevent his
passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big arm chair
carried to marius bedside he required his daughter to take the
finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages mademoiselle
gillenormand like a sage and elderly person contrived to spare the
fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed
m gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him that for the
preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen
nor new linen as old linen he was present at all the dressings of the
wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself
when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said aie aie
nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy
offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling draught he overwhelmed the
doctor with questions he did not observe that he asked the same ones
on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of
danger the good man was in a delirium he made his porter a present of
three louis that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced
a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the
jeanne est nee a fougere amour tu vis en elle
vrai nid dune bergere car cest dans sa prunelle
jadore son jupon que tu mets ton carquois
love thou dwellest in her for tis in her eyes that thou placest thy
as for me i sing her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and
then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the
half open door made sure that he was praying
up to that time he had not believed in god
at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more
pronounced the grandfather raved he executed a multitude of mechanical
actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without
knowing why a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at
receiving a big bouquet it was m gillenormand who had sent it to
her the husband made a jealous scene m gillenormand tried to draw
nicolette upon his knees he called marius m le baron he shouted
every moment he kept asking the doctor is he no longer in danger
he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother he brooded over him
while he ate he no longer knew himself he no longer rendered himself
an account of himself marius was the master of the house there was
abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson
in the state of joy in which he then was he was the most venerable of
children in his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent
he stepped behind him to smile he was content joyous delighted
charming young his white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay
radiance of his visage when grace is mingled with wrinkles it is
adorable there is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age
as for marius as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him
after the fever and delirium had left him he did not again pronounce
her name and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of
her he held his peace precisely because his soul was there
he did not know what had become of cosette the whole affair of the
rue de la chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory shadows that were
almost indistinct floated through his mind eponine gavroche mabeuf
the thenardiers all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke
of the barricade the strange passage of m fauchelevent through that
adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest he
understood nothing connected with his own life he did not know how nor
by whom he had been saved and no one of those around him knew this all
that they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought home
at night in a hackney coach to the rue des filles du calvaire past
present future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea
but in that fog there was one immovable point one clear and precise
outline something made of granite a resolution a will to find
cosette once more for him the idea of life was not distinct from the
idea of cosette he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept
the one without the other and he was immovably resolved to exact of
any person whatever who should desire to force him to live from his
grandfather from fate from hell the restitution of his vanished
he did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed
let us here emphasize one detail he was not won over and was but little
softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather in
the first place he was not in the secret then in his reveries of
an invalid which were still feverish possibly he distrusted this
tenderness as a strange and novel thing which had for its object his
conquest he remained cold the grandfather absolutely wasted his poor
old smile marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he
marius did not speak and let things take their course but that when
it became a question of cosette he would find another face and that
his grandfathers true attitude would be unmasked then there would
be an unpleasant scene a recrudescence of family questions a
confrontation of positions every sort of sarcasm and all manner of
objections at one and the same time fauchelevent coupelevent fortune
poverty a stone about his neck the future violent resistance
conclusion a refusal marius stiffened himself in advance
and then in proportion as he regained life the old ulcers of his
memory opened once more he reflected again on the past colonel
pontmercy placed himself once more between m gillenormand and him
marius he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect from
a person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father and
with health there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his
grandfather the old man was gently pained by this m gillenormand
without however allowing it to appear observed that marius ever since
the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness
had not once called him father it is true that he did not say
monsieur to him but he contrived not to say either the one or the
other by means of a certain way of turning his phrases obviously a
as almost always happens in such cases marius skirmished before giving
battle by way of proving himself this is called feeling the ground
one morning it came to pass that m gillenormand spoke slightingly of
the convention apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his
hands and gave vent to a royalist harangue on danton saint juste and
robespierre the men of 93 were giants said marius with severity
the old man held his peace and uttered not a sound during the remainder
marius who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of
his early years interpreted this silence as a profound concentration
of wrath augured from it a hot conflict and augmented his preparations
for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind
he decided that in case of a refusal he would tear off his bandages
dislocate his collar bone that he would lay bare all the wounds which
he had left and would reject all food his wounds were his munitions of
he awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick
one day m gillenormand while his daughter was putting in order the
phials and cups on the marble of the commode bent over marius and said
to him in his tenderest accents look here my little marius if i were
in your place i would eat meat now in preference to fish a fried sole
is excellent to begin a convalescence with but a good cutlet is needed
to put a sick man on his feet
marius who had almost entirely recovered his strength collected
the whole of it drew himself up into a sitting posture laid his two
clenched fists on the sheets of his bed looked his grandfather in the
this leads me to say something to you
agreed said his grandfather and he burst out laughing
yes agreed you shall have your little girl
marius stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock trembled in
yes you shall have her that pretty little girl of yours she comes
every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you ever
since you were wounded she has passed her time in weeping and making
lint i have made inquiries she lives in the rue de lhomme arme no
7 ah there we have it ah so you want her well you shall have
her youre caught you had arranged your little plot you had said to
yourself im going to signify this squarely to my grandfather to
that mummy of the regency and of the directory to that ancient beau
to that dorante turned geronte he has indulged in his frivolities also
that he has and he has had his love affairs and his grisettes and his
cosettes he has made his rustle he has had his wings he has eaten of
the bread of spring he certainly must remember it ah you take the
cockchafer by the horns thats good i offer you a cutlet and you
answer me by the way i want to marry theres a transition for
you ah you reckoned on a bickering you do not know that i am an old
coward what do you say to that you are vexed you did not expect to
find your grandfather still more foolish than yourself you are wasting
the discourse which you meant to bestow upon me mr lawyer and thats
vexatious well so much the worse rage away ill do whatever
you wish and that cuts you short imbecile listen i have made my
inquiries im cunning too she is charming she is discreet it is not
true about the lancer she has made heaps of lint shes a jewel she
adores you if you had died there would have been three of us her
coffin would have accompanied mine i have had an idea ever since you
have been better of simply planting her at your bedside but it is only
in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome
young wounded men who interest them it is not done what would your
aunt have said to it you were nude three quarters of the time my good
fellow ask nicolette who has not left you for a moment if there was
any possibility of having a woman here and then what would the doctor
have said a pretty girl does not cure a man of fever in short its
all right let us say no more about it alls said alls done its all
settled take her such is my ferocity you see i perceived that you
did not love me i said to myself here now i have my little cosette
right under my hand im going to give her to him he will be obliged
to love me a little then or he must tell the reason why ah so you
thought that the old man was going to storm to put on a big voice
to shout no and to lift his cane at all that aurora not a bit of it
cosette so be it love so be it i ask nothing better pray take the
trouble of getting married sir be happy my well beloved child
that said the old man burst forth into sobs
and he seized marius head and pressed it with both arms against his
breast and both fell to weeping this is one of the forms of supreme
ah so you love me said the old man
an ineffable moment ensued they were choking and could not speak
come his mouth is unstopped at last he has said father to me
marius disengaged his head from his grandfathers arms and said gently
but father now that i am quite well it seems to me that i might see
agreed again you shall see her to morrow
well to day then let it be to day you have called me father three
times and it is worth it i will attend to it she shall be brought
hither agreed i tell you it has already been put into verse this is
the ending of the elegy of the jeune malade by andre chenier by andre
chenier whose throat was cut by the ras    by the giants of 93
m gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of
marius who in truth as we must admit was no longer listening to him
and who was thinking far more of cosette than of 1793
the grandfather trembling at having so inopportunely introduced andre
cut his throat is not the word the fact is that the great
revolutionary geniuses who were not malicious that is incontestable
who were heroes pardi found that andre chenier embarrassed them
somewhat and they had him guillot    that is to say those great
men on the 7th of thermidor besought andre chenier in the interests of
public safety to be so good as to go   
m gillenormand clutched by the throat by his own phrase could not
proceed being able neither to finish it nor to retract it while his
daughter arranged the pillow behind marius who was overwhelmed with so
many emotions the old man rushed headlong with as much rapidity as
his age permitted from the bed chamber shut the door behind him and
purple choking and foaming at the mouth his eyes starting from his
head he found himself nose to nose with honest basque who was blacking
boots in the anteroom he seized basque by the collar and shouted full
in his face in fury by the hundred thousand javottes of the devil
chapter iv mademoiselle gillenormand ends by no longer thinking it a
bad thing that m fauchelevent should have entered with something under
cosette and marius beheld each other once more
what that interview was like we decline to say there are things which
one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them
the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in
marius chamber at the moment when cosette entered it
precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing
his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and
she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded
cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven she was as
thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness she stammered all
pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius arms and
dared not ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people people
are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most
desire to be left alone lovers have no need of any people whatever
with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair
who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile
it was monsieur fauchelevent it was jean valjean
he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in
perfectly new garments and with a white cravat
the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct
bourgeois in this probable notary the fear inspiring bearer of the
corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of june
tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and mire
supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his porters scent
was aroused when m fauchelevent arrived with cosette the porter had
not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside i
dont know why it is but i cant help fancying that ive seen that face
m fauchelevent in marius chamber remained apart near the door he
had under his arm a package which bore considerable resemblance to an
octavo volume enveloped in paper the enveloping paper was of a greenish
does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm
mademoiselle gillenormand who did not like books demanded in a low
well retorted m gillenormand who had overheard her in the same
tone hes a learned man what then is that his fault monsieur
boulard one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under
his arm either and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart
father gillenormand did not do it intentionally but inattention to
proper names was an aristocratic habit of his
monsieur tranchelevent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my
grandson baron marius pontmercy for the hand of mademoiselle
and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing
they did not require him to repeat it twice so much the worse the
chirping began they talked low marius resting on his elbow on his
reclining chair cosette standing beside him oh heavens murmured
cosette i see you once again it is thou it is you the idea of going
and fighting like that but why it is horrible i have been dead for
four months oh how wicked it was of you to go to that battle what had
i done to you i pardon you but you will never do it again a little
while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought
that i was about to die but it was from joy i was so sad i have not
taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks
what will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar do speak
you let me do all the talking we are still in the rue de lhomme arme
it seems that your shoulder was terrible they told me that you could
put your fist in it and then it seems that they cut your flesh with
the scissors that is frightful i have cried till i have no eyes left
it is queer that a person can suffer like that your grandfather has a
very kindly air dont disturb yourself dont rise on your elbow you
will injure yourself oh how happy i am so our unhappiness is over
i am quite foolish i had things to say to you and i no longer know in
the least what they were do you still love me we live in the rue de
lhomme arme there is no garden i made lint all the time stay sir
look it is your fault i have a callous on my fingers
angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out no
other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it
then as there were spectators they paused and said not a word more
contenting themselves with softly touching each others hands
m gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried
talk loud the rest of you make a noise you people behind the scenes
come a little uproar the deuce so that the children can chatter at
and approaching marius and cosette he said to them in a very low
call each other thou dont stand on ceremony
aunt gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light
in her elderly household there was nothing aggressive about this
amazement it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and
envious glance of an owl at two turtle doves it was the stupid eye of a
poor innocent seven and fifty years of age it was a life which had been
mademoiselle gillenormand senior said her father to her i told you
that this is what would happen to you
he remained silent for a moment and then added
how pretty she is how pretty she is shes a greuze so you are going

off nicely with me you are happy if i were not fifteen years too old
we would fight with swords to see which of us should have her come now

right you are in the right ah what a sweet charming little wedding
this will make our parish is saint denis du saint sacrament but i will

opposite the fountain of cardinal de birague the masterpiece of jesuit
architecture is at namur it is called saint loup you must go there
after you are married it is worth the journey mademoiselle i am quite
of your mind i think girls ought to marry that is what they are made
for there is a certain sainte catherine whom i should always like to
see uncoiffed62 its a fine thing to remain a spinster but it is
chilly the bible says multiply in order to save the people jeanne
darc is needed but in order to make people what is needed is mother
goose so marry my beauties i really do not see the use in remaining
a spinster i know that they have their chapel apart in the church
and that they fall back on the society of the virgin but sapristi a
handsome husband a fine fellow and at the expiration of a year a
big blond brat who nurses lustily and who has fine rolls of fat on his
thighs and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy
paws laughing the while like the dawn thats better than holding a
the grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty year old heels and
began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more
alcippe il est donc vrai dans peu tu te maries63
he seated himself near them made cosette sit down and took their four
she is exquisite this darling shes a masterpiece this cosette
she is a very little girl and a very great lady she will only be a
baroness which is a come down for her she was born a marquise what
eyelashes she has get it well fixed in your noddles my children that
you are in the true road love each other be foolish about it love is
the folly of men and the wit of god adore each other only he added
suddenly becoming gloomy what a misfortune it has just occurred to
me more than half of what i possess is swallowed up in an annuity so
long as i live it will not matter but after my death a score of years
hence ah my poor children you will not have a sou your beautiful
white hands madame la baronne will do the devil the honor of pulling
at this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say
so far he had not uttered a single word no one seemed to be aware that
he was there and he had remained standing erect and motionless behind
what has mademoiselle euphrasie to do with the question inquired the
minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs possibly said jean
and he laid on the table the package which mademoiselle gillenormand had
jean valjean himself opened the package it was a bundle of bank notes
they were turned over and counted there were five hundred notes for a
thousand francs each and one hundred and sixty eight of five hundred
in all five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
this is a fine book said m gillenormand
five hundred and eighty four thousand francs murmured the aunt
this arranges things well does it not mademoiselle gillenormand
senior said the grandfather that devil of a marius has ferreted out
the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams just trust
to the love affairs of young folks now will you students find
studentesses with six hundred thousand francs cherubino works better
five hundred and eighty four thousand francs repeated mademoiselle
gillenormand in a low tone five hundred and eighty four one might as
as for marius and cosette they were gazing at each other while this was
chapter v deposit your money in a forest rather than with a notary
the reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy
explanation that jean valjean after the champmathieu affair had been
able thanks to his first escape of a few days duration to come to
paris and to withdraw in season from the hands of laffitte the
sum earned by him under the name of monsieur madeleine at
montreuil sur mer and that fearing that he might be recaptured which
eventually happened he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest
of montfermeil in the locality known as the blaru bottom the sum
six hundred and thirty thousand francs all in bank bills was not very
bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the
box from dampness he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut
shavings in the same coffer he had placed his other treasures the
bishops candlesticks it will be remembered that he had carried off
the candlesticks when he made his escape from montreuil sur mer the man
seen one evening for the first time by boulatruelle was jean valjean
later on every time that jean valjean needed money he went to get it
in the blaru bottom hence the absences which we have mentioned he had
a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a hiding place known to himself
alone when he beheld marius convalescent feeling that the hour was at
hand when that money might prove of service he had gone to get it
it was he again whom boulatruelle had seen in the woods but on
this occasion in the morning instead of in the evening boulatreulle
the actual sum was five hundred and eighty four thousand five hundred
francs jean valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself we
the difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand
francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years
from 1823 to 1833 the five years of his stay in the convent had cost
jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney piece where they
moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert the
story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in
the moniteur how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned
under a boat belonging to some laundresses between the pont au change
and the pont neuf and that a writing left by this man otherwise
irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit
of mental aberration and a suicide in fact thought jean valjean
since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must
