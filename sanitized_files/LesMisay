one who was rich makes himself poor what he has he gives to all he
who was what is called noble a gentleman and a lord is the equal of

same tonsure wear the same frock eat the same black bread sleep on
the same straw die on the same ashes the same sack on their backs the
same rope around their loins if the decision has been to go barefoot
all go barefoot there may be a prince among them that prince is the
same shadow as the rest no titles even family names have disappeared
they bear only first names all are bowed beneath the equality of
baptismal names they have dissolved the carnal family and constituted
in their community a spiritual family they have no other relatives than
all men they succor the poor they care for the sick they elect those

you stop me and exclaim but that is the ideal convent
it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent that i should take
thence it results that in the preceding book i have spoken of a
convent with respectful accents the middle ages cast aside asia cast
aside the historical and political question held in reserve from the
purely philosophical point of view outside the requirements of militant
policy on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary
matter and shall contain only consenting parties i shall always
consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive and in some
wherever there is a community there is a commune where there is a
commune there is right the monastery is the product of the formula
equality fraternity oh how grand is liberty and what a splendid
transfiguration liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a
but these men or these women who are behind these four walls they
dress themselves in coarse woollen they are equals they call each
other brothers that is well but they do something else
they gaze on the darkness they kneel and they clasp their hands
to pray to god what is the meaning of these words
is there an infinite beyond us is that infinite there inherent
permanent necessarily substantial since it is infinite and because
if it lacked matter it would be bounded necessarily intelligent since
it is infinite and because if it lacked intelligence it would end
there does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence while we can
attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence in other terms is it
not the absolute of which we are only the relative
at the same time that there is an infinite without us is there not
an infinite within us are not these two infinites what an alarming
plural superposed the one upon the other is not this second
infinite so to speak subjacent to the first is it not the latters
mirror reflection echo an abyss which is concentric with another
abyss is this second infinity intelligent also does it think does
it love does it will if these two infinities are intelligent each of
them has a will principle and there is an i in the upper infinity as
there is an i in the lower infinity the i below is the soul the
to place the infinity here below in contact by the medium of thought
with the infinity on high is called praying
let us take nothing from the human mind to suppress is bad we must
reform and transform certain faculties in man are directed towards
the unknown thought revery prayer the unknown is an ocean what
is conscience it is the compass of the unknown thought revery
prayer these are great and mysterious radiations let us respect them
whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul into the shadow
the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of
humanity close to the right of the man beside it at the least there
to crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite such is the law let
us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of
creation and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars we
have a duty to labor over the human soul to defend the mystery against
the miracle to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd
to admit as an inexplicable fact only what is necessary to purify
belief to remove superstitions from above religion to clear god of
with regard to the modes of prayer all are good provided that they are
sincere turn your book upside down and be in the infinite
there is as we know a philosophy which denies the infinite there is
also a philosophy pathologically classified which denies the sun this
to erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth is a fine blind
the curious thing is the haughty superior and compassionate airs which
this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds
god one fancies he hears a mole crying i pity them with their sun
there are as we know powerful and illustrious atheists at bottom led
back to the truth by their very force they are not absolutely sure that
they are atheists it is with them only a question of definition and in
any case if they do not believe in god being great minds they prove
we salute them as philosophers while inexorably denouncing their
the remarkable thing about it is also their facility in paying
themselves off with words a metaphysical school of the north
impregnated to some extent with fog has fancied that it has worked a
revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the
to say the plant wills instead of the plant grows this would be
fecund in results indeed if we were to add the universe wills why
because it would come to this the plant wills therefore it has an i
the universe wills therefore it has a god
as for us who however in contradistinction to this school reject
nothing a priori a will in the plant accepted by this school appears
to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it
to deny the will of the infinite that is to say god is impossible on
any other conditions than a denial of the infinite we have demonstrated
the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism everything
with nihilism no discussion is possible for the nihilist logic doubts
the existence of its interlocutor and is not quite sure that it exists
from its point of view it is possible that it may be for itself only
only it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the
lump simply by the utterance of the word mind
in short no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all
to no there is only one reply yes
there is no such thing as nothingness zero does not exist everything
man lives by affirmation even more than by bread
even to see and to show does not suffice philosophy should be an
energy it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition
of man socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius in
other words the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man
of felicity eden should be changed into a lyceum science should be
a cordial to enjoy what a sad aim and what a paltry ambition the
brute enjoys to offer thought to the thirst of men to give them all as
an elixir the notion of god to make conscience and science fraternize
in them to render them just by this mysterious confrontation such is
the function of real philosophy morality is a blossoming out of truths
contemplation leads to action the absolute should be practicable it is
necessary that the ideal should be breathable drinkable and eatable to
the human mind it is the ideal which has the right to say take this
it is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science
and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying and that
philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it
at its ease without any other result than that of being convenient to
for our part adjourning the development of our thought to another
occasion we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand
man as a point of departure nor progress as an end without those two
forces which are their two motors faith and love
progress is the goal the ideal is the type
chapter vii precautions to be observed in blame
history and philosophy have eternal duties which are at the same time
simple duties to combat caiphas the high priest draco the lawgiver
trimalcion the legislator tiberius the emperor this is clear direct
but the right to live apart even with its inconveniences and its
abuses insists on being stated and taken into account cenobitism is a
when one speaks of convents those abodes of error but of innocence
of aberration but of good will of ignorance but of devotion of torture
but of martyrdom it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no
a convent is a contradiction its object salvation its means thereto
sacrifice the convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme
to abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of
in the cloister one suffers in order to enjoy one draws a bill of
exchange on death one discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light
in the cloister hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise
the taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity
it does not seem to us that on such a subject mockery is permissible
all about it is serious the good as well as the bad
the just man frowns but never smiles with a malicious sneer we
we blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues we despise the
spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal but we everywhere honor
a faith this is a necessity for man woe to him who believes nothing
one is not unoccupied because one is absorbed there is visible labor
to contemplate is to labor to think is to act
folded arms toil clasped hands work a gaze fixed on heaven is a work
thales remained motionless for four years he founded philosophy
in our opinion cenobites are not lazy men and recluses are not idlers
to meditate on the shadow is a serious thing
without invalidating anything that we have just said we believe that
a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living on this point
the priest and the philosopher agree we must die the abbe de la trappe
to mingle with ones life a certain presence of the sepulchre this is
the law of the sage and it is the law of the ascetic in this respect
the ascetic and the sage converge there is a material growth we
admit it there is a moral grandeur we hold to that thoughtless and
what is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery
what purpose do they serve what do they do
alas in the presence of the darkness which environs us and which
awaits us in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of
us we reply there is probably no work more divine than that performed
by these souls and we add there is probably no work which is more
there certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never
in our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is
leibnitz praying is grand voltaire adoring is fine deo erexit
we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons and the
moreover at this minute which we are now traversing a minute which
will not fortunately leave its impress on the nineteenth century at
this hour when so many men have low brows and souls but little
elevated among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment
and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter
whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us
the monastery is a renunciation sacrifice wrongly directed is still
sacrifice to mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its
taken by itself and ideally and in order to examine the truth on all
sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted the monastery
the female convent in particular for in our century it is woman who
suffers the most and in this exile of the cloister there is something
of protestation the female convent has incontestably a certain
this cloistered existence which is so austere so depressing a few of
whose features we have just traced is not life for it is not liberty
it is not the tomb for it is not plenitude it is the strange place
whence one beholds as from the crest of a lofty mountain on one side
the abyss where we are on the other the abyss whither we shall go it
is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds illuminated
and obscured by both at the same time where the ray of life which has
become enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death it is the half
we who do not believe what these women believe but who like them
live by faith we have never been able to think without a sort of
tender and religious terror without a sort of pity that is full of
envy of those devoted trembling and trusting creatures of these
humble and august souls who dare to dwell on the very brink of the
mystery waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is
not yet open turned towards the light which one cannot see possessing
the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is aspiring
towards the gulf and the unknown their eyes fixed motionless on the
darkness kneeling bewildered stupefied shuddering half lifted at
book eighth cemeteries take that which is committed them
chapter i which treats of the manner of entering a convent
it was into this house that jean valjean had as fauchelevent expressed
he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue
polonceau that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle
of the night was the nuns chanting matins that hall of which he had
caught a glimpse in the gloom was the chapel that phantom which he had
seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation
that bell the sound of which had so strangely surprised him was the
gardeners bell attached to the knee of father fauchelevent
cosette once put to bed jean valjean and fauchelevent had as we have
already seen supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a
good crackling fire then the only bed in the hut being occupied by
cosette each threw himself on a truss of straw
before he shut his eyes jean valjean said i must remain here
henceforth this remark trotted through fauchelevents head all night
to tell the truth neither of them slept
jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that javert was on
his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to
paris then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded
him in this cloister jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to
remain there now for an unfortunate man in his position this
convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most
dangerous because as no men might enter there if he were discovered
it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step
intervening between the convent and prison the safest because if he
could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there who would
ever seek him in such a place to dwell in an impossible place was
on his side fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains he began by
declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter how had
m madeleine got there when the walls were what they were cloister
walls are not to be stepped over how did he get there with a child one
cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in ones arms who was
that child where did they both come from since fauchelevent had lived
in the convent he had heard nothing of m sur m and he knew nothing
of what had taken place there father madeleine had an air which
discouraged questions and besides fauchelevent said to himself one
does not question a saint m madeleine had preserved all his prestige
in fauchelevents eyes only from some words which jean valjean had let
fall the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m madeleine
had probably become bankrupt through the hard times and that he was
pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some
political affair and was in hiding which last did not displease
fauchelevent who like many of our peasants of the north had an
old fund of bonapartism about him while in hiding m madeleine had
selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should
wish to remain there but the inexplicable point to which fauchelevent
returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m
madeleine should be there and that he should have that little girl with
him fauchelevent saw them touched them spoke to them and still did
not believe it possible the incomprehensible had just made its entrance
into fauchelevents hut fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures and
could see nothing clearly but this m madeleine saved my life
this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course he said to
himself it is my turn now he added in his conscience m madeleine
did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself
under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out he made up his mind
nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers
replies after what he did for me would i save him if he were a thief
just the same if he were an assassin would i save him just the same
since he is a saint shall i save him just the same
but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent
fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical
undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder
than his self devotion his good will and a little of that old
rustic cunning on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous
enterprise undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister and the
steep escarpments of the rule of saint benoit father fauchelevent was
an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end
of his days halt infirm with no interest left to him in the world
found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be
performed flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he
is dying should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he
had never tasted and should swallow it with avidity we may add
that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had
destroyed all personality in him and had ended by rendering a good
action of some kind absolutely necessary to him
so he took his resolve to devote himself to m madeleine
we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy that description
is just but incomplete at the point of this story which we have now
reached a little of father fauchelevents physiology becomes useful
he was a peasant but he had been a notary which added trickery to his
cunning and penetration to his ingenuousness having through various
causes failed in his business he had descended to the calling of a
carter and a laborer but in spite of oaths and lashings which horses
seem to require something of the notary had lingered in him he had
some natural wit he talked good grammar he conversed which is a rare
thing in a village and the other peasants said of him he talks almost
like a gentleman with a hat fauchelevent belonged in fact to that
species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last
century qualified as demi bourgeois demi lout and which the metaphors
showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the
pigeon hole of the plebeian rather rustic rather citified pepper and
salt fauchelevent though sorely tried and harshly used by fate
worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an
impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious
quality which prevents one from ever being wicked his defects and his
vices for he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy
was of the kind which succeeds with an observer his aged face had none
of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify
at daybreak father fauchelevent opened his eyes after having done an
enormous deal of thinking and beheld m madeleine seated on his truss
of straw and watching cosettes slumbers fauchelevent sat up and
now that you are here how are you going to contrive to enter
this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his
in the first place said fauchelevent you will begin by not setting
foot outside of this chamber either you or the child one step in the
monsieur madeleine resumed fauchelevent you have arrived at a very
auspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of
the ladies is very ill this will prevent them from looking much in our
direction it seems that she is dying the prayers of the forty hours
are being said the whole community is in confusion that occupies them
the one who is on the point of departure is a saint in fact we are
all saints here all the difference between them and me is that they say
our cell and that i say my cabin the prayers for the dying are to
be said and then the prayers for the dead we shall be at peace here
for to day but i will not answer for to morrow
still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the
wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible
and i add that the nuns never come near it
the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified
it seems to me that one may remain concealed here it was to this
just as fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had
the nun is dead said he there is the knell
and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen
it is the knell monsieur madeleine the bell will continue to strike
once a minute for twenty four hours until the body is taken from the
church you see they play at recreation hours it suffices to have a
ball roll aside to send them all hither in spite of prohibitions to
hunt and rummage for it all about here those cherubs are devils
the little girls you would be very quickly discovered they would
shriek oh a man there is no danger to day there will be no
recreation hour the day will be entirely devoted to prayers you hear
the bell as i told you a stroke each minute it is the death knell
pardine there are little girls indeed and they would bawl around you
and they would rush off to be a man here is to have the plague you see
how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast
jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought this convent
no said fauchelevent the difficulty is to get out
jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart
yes monsieur madeleine in order to return here it is first necessary
and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded
you must not be found here in this fashion whence come you for me
you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to
all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell
ah said fauchelevent they are ringing up the vocal mothers they
are going to the chapter they always hold a chapter when any one dies
she died at daybreak people generally do die at daybreak but cannot
you get out by the way in which you entered come i do not ask for the
sake of questioning you but how did you get in
jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into
that terrible street made him shudder you make your way out of a forest
filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that
shall advise you to return thither jean valjean pictured to himself the
whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on
the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his
collar javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps
impossible said he father fauchelevent say that i fell from the
but i believe it i believe it retorted fauchelevent you have no
need to tell me that the good god must have taken you in his hand for
the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped
you only he meant to place you in a mans convent he made a mistake
come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and
inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view a
corpse all that is the ceremony of dying these good ladies are not
at all fond of that visit a doctor is a man who does not believe in
anything he lifts the veil sometimes he lifts something else too how
quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time what is the matter
your little one is still asleep what is her name
she is your daughter you are her grandfather that is
it will be easy enough for her to get out of here i have my service
door which opens on the courtyard i knock the porter opens i have
my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out father
fauchelevent goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural you
will tell the child to keep very quiet she will be under the cover i
will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend a
fruit seller whom i know in the rue chemin vert who is deaf and who
has a little bed i will shout in the fruit sellers ear that she is a
niece of mine and that she is to keep her for me until to morrow then
the little one will re enter with you for i will contrive to have you
re enter it must be done but how will you manage to get out
no one must see me the whole point lies there father fauchelevent
find some means of getting me out in a basket under cover like
fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his
that is the dead doctor taking his departure said fauchelevent he
has taken a look and said she is dead that is well when the doctor
has signed the passport for paradise the undertakers company sends a
coffin if it is a mother the mothers lay her out if she is a sister
the sisters lay her out after which i nail her up that forms a part
of my gardeners duty a gardener is a bit of a grave digger she is
placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street
and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead i dont
count the undertakers men and myself as men it is in that hall that i
nail up the coffin the undertakers men come and get it and whip
up coachman thats the way one goes to heaven they fetch a box with
nothing in it they take it away again with something in it thats what
a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping
cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an
angel drinking in the light jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her
that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence the
good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble
the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery they declare that they are
going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery it is an ancient cemetery
which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is
going to retire it is a shame for it is convenient i have a friend
there father mestienne the grave digger the nuns here possess one
privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall there is
a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf but how many
events have happened since yesterday mother crucifixion is dead and
goodness if you were here for good it would be a real burial
a fourth peal burst out fauchelevent hastily detached the belled
knee cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again
this time it is for me the mother prioress wants me good now i am
pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle monsieur madeleine dont
stir from here and wait for me something new has come up if you are
and he hastened out of the hut crying coming coming
jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his
crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his
less than ten minutes later father fauchelevent whose bell put the
nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice
replied forever forever that is to say enter
the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the
gardener on business this parlor adjoined the chapter hall the
prioress seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for
chapter ii fauchelevent in the presence of a difficulty
it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions
notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical
occasions at the moment when fauchelevent entered this double form of
preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress who was
that wise and charming mademoiselle de blemeur mother innocente who
the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell the
prioress who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said
this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
and so have i said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him
inward terror i have something to say to the very reverend mother
ah you have a communication to make to me
goodman fauchelevent the ex notary belonged to the category of
peasants who have assurance a certain clever ignorance constitutes a
force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it fauchelevent
had been a success during the something more than two years which he had
passed in the convent always solitary and busied about his gardening
he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity as he was at a
distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before
him only an agitation of shadows by dint of attention and sharpness
he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those
corpses were alive for him he was like a deaf man whose sight grows
keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute he had
applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals
and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister
possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his
ear fauchelevent knew all and concealed all that constituted his art
the whole convent thought him stupid a great merit in religion the
vocal mothers made much of fauchelevent he was a curious mute he
inspired confidence moreover he was regular and never went out except
for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden
this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit none the less he
had set two men to chattering the porter in the convent and he
knew the singularities of their parlor and the grave digger at
the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their
sepulture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of
these nuns one as to their life the other as to their death but he
did not abuse his knowledge the congregation thought a great deal of
him old lame blind to everything probably a little deaf into the
bargain what qualities they would have found it difficult to replace
the goodman with the assurance of a person who feels that he is
appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue
to the reverend prioress he talked a long time about his age his
infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth
of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden
of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had
been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds because of the moon
and he wound up as follows that he had a brother the prioress made
a movement a brother no longer young a second movement on the
part of the prioress but one expressive of reassurance that if he
might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help
him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive
from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his
brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was
broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged
greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little
daughter whom he would bring with him who might be reared for god in
the house and who might who knows become a nun some day
when he had finished speaking the prioress stayed the slipping of her
rosary between her fingers and said to him
could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening
the prioress without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining
room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mothers
about a quarter of an hour elapsed the prioress returned and seated
the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied we will present a stenographic
report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
i have a little cage there where i hear the mass and the offices
and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties
the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you
we have only a woman here to help you each one does what he can
because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of
saint bernard while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and
sixty seven i do not despise merlonus horstius
merit consists in working according to ones strength a cloister is
and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strong one though
that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door
and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot
that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
and the four mother precentors will help you
i am here to do anything you wish
a silence ensued the prioress after a pout of the under lip which
you know that a mother died this morning
nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden
and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
the prioress paused moved her lips as though in mental prayer and
three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox
merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer
ah yes now i hear the knell reverend mother
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the
no other man than you can or must enter that chamber see to that a
fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room
reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more
i dont understand you why do you say more often
in order to speak like you reverend mother
at nine oclock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be
the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress
the clock struck opportunely it cut more often short it is probable
that had it not been for this the prioress and fauchelevent would never
the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred
in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she
she will replied father fauchelevent falling into step and striving
father fauvent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion
no doubt it is not granted to every one to die like cardinal de
berulle while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to
god while pronouncing these words hanc igitur oblationem but without
attaining to such happiness mother crucifixions death was very
precious she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels she gave us her last
commands if you had a little more faith and if you could have been
in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it
she smiled we felt that she was regaining her life in god there was
fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
father fauvent what the dead wish must be done
the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet fauchelevent held
i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our
lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and
