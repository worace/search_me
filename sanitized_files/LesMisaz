reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the
besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint
she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our
for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one
fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did
saint didorus archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word
might be inscribed on his tomb acarus which signifies a worm of the
the blessed mezzocane abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the
saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties
into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the
sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that
passers by would spit on his tomb this was done the dead must be
the body of bernard guidonis born in france near roche abeille was
as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the
church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guidonis was
bishop of tuy in spain can the contrary be affirmed
the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse
several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence the
father fauvent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in
which she has slept for the last twenty years
so i shall have to nail up that coffin
and we are to reject the undertakers coffin
i am at the orders of the very reverend community
in nailing up the coffin i do not need them
you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring
the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of
the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where
she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
oh i am a stone in your walls
the chapter assembled the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted
again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother
crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin
under our altar think father fauvent if she were to work miracles
here what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from
but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission 
saint benoit ii in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine
chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls
under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns
to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
the world is nothing in the presence of the cross martin the eleventh
general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dum
amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this
manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin
any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long on
the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison bearing in
his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he
halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and
made very great efforts to convince it the prioress who was usually
subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull
rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away
i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard who was bernard the
first abbot of clairvaux fontaines in burgundy is a country that is
blest because it gave him birth his father was named tecelin and his
mother alethe he began at citeaux to end in clairvaux he was ordained
abbot by the bishop of chalon sur saone guillaume de champeaux he had
seven hundred novices and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries he
overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in 1140 and pierre de bruys
and henry his disciple and another sort of erring spirits who were
called the apostolics he confounded arnauld de brescia darted
lightning at the monk raoul the murderer of the jews dominated the
council of reims in 1148 caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea
bishop of poitiers caused the condemnation of eon de letoile arranged
the disputes of princes enlightened king louis the young advised pope
eugene iii regulated the temple preached the crusade performed
two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many
as thirty nine in one day who was benoit he was the patriarch of
mont cassin he was the second founder of the saintete claustrale
he was the basil of the west his order has produced forty popes two
hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four
thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses forty six
kings forty one queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints
and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years on one side saint
bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department on one side
saint benoit on the other the inspector of public ways the state
the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the
administration what do we know of all that there is not a chance
passer by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated we
have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ your sanitary
department is a revolutionary invention god subordinated to the
commissary of police such is the age silence fauvent
fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath the prioress
no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture only fanatics
and those in error deny it we live in times of terrible confusion we
do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which
we should ignore we are ignorant and impious in this age there exist
people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and
the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good
ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century others are so
blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi to the cross of
jesus christ louis xvi was merely a king let us beware of god there
is no longer just nor unjust the name of voltaire is known but not
the name of cesar de bus nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed
memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory the last arch bishop
the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de
gondren succeeded to berulle and francois bourgoin to gondren
and jean francois senault to bourgoin and father sainte marthe to
jean francois senault the name of father coton is known not because
he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie but
because he furnished henri iv the huguenot king with the material
for an oath that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de
sales is that he cheated at play and then religion is attacked why
because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap
was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them
followed mommol what has that to do with the question does that
prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak
to a beggar they persecute the saints they shut their eyes to the
truth darkness is the rule the most ferocious beasts are beasts which
are blind no one thinks of hell as a reality oh how wicked people
are by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy
death is prohibited burial is a civil matter this is horrible saint
leo ii wrote two special letters one to pierre notaire the other to
the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting
in questions touching the dead the authority of the exarch and the
supremacy of the emperor gauthier bishop of chalons held his own
in this matter against otho duke of burgundy the ancient magistracy
agreed with him in former times we had voices in the chapter even on
matters of the day the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was
councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy we do what
we please with our dead is not the body of saint benoit himself in
france in the abbey of fleury called saint benoit sur loire although
he died in italy at mont cassin on saturday the 21st of the month
of march of the year 543 all this is incontestable i abhor
psalm singers i hate priors i execrate heretics but i should detest
yet more any one who should maintain the contrary one has only to
read arnoul wion gabriel bucelin trithemus maurolics and dom luc
the prioress took breath then turned to fauchelevent
that is understood you will close the coffin the sisters will carry
it to the chapel the office for the dead will then be said then we
shall return to the cloister between eleven oclock and midnight you
will come with your iron bar all will be done in the most profound
secrecy there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors
she will not listen besides what the cloister knows the world learns
you will remove your bell it is not necessary that the sister at the
has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
he will pay it at four oclock to day the peal which orders the
doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung but you do not
i pay no attention to any but my own
reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required
where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking i have my
heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
about three quarters of an hour before midnight do not forget
if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the
you will do it as speedily as possible
i cannot work very fast i am infirm that is why i require an
to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing the emperor henry ii
who combated antipope gregory and re established benoit viii has two
two surtouts are a good thing murmured fauchelevent who really was a
now that i think of it father fauvent let us give a whole hour to it
that is not too much be near the principal altar with your iron bar
at eleven oclock the office begins at midnight everything must have
been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my
orders i am to nail up the coffin at eleven oclock exactly i am to
be in the chapel the mother precentors will be there mother ascension
will be there two men would be better however never mind i shall
have my lever we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and
we will close the vault again after which there will be no trace
of anything the government will have no suspicion thus all has been
this produced a pause fauchelevent meditated the prioress meditated
what is to be done with that coffin father fauvent
another silence fauchelevent made with his left hand that sort of a
reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the
basement of the church and no one can enter there but myself and i
yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it
into the grave will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it
the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at
the gardener the vil stuck fast in his throat
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the
you are right earth that is the same thing as man so you will manage
the prioresss face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene
once more she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to
him fauchelevent went towards the door as he was on the point of
passing out the prioress raised her voice gently
i am pleased with you father fauvent bring your brother to me
to morrow after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter
chapter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read
the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man
they do not reach their goal very promptly moreover fauchelevent
was in a dilemma he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his
cottage in the garden cosette had waked up jean valjean had placed her
near the fire at the moment when fauchelevent entered jean valjean was
pointing out to her the vintners basket on the wall and saying to her
listen attentively to me my little cosette we must go away from this
house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here the
good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that
you will wait for me at a ladys house i shall come to fetch you obey
and say nothing above all things unless you want madame thenardier to
jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the
everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent i have
permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be
got out thats where the difficulty lies it is easy enough with the
and after a silence fraught with anxiety fauchelevent exclaimed
jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
there is another thing which bothers me i have said that i would put
earth in it when i come to think it over the earth instead of the
corpse will not seem like the real thing it wont do it will get
displaced it will move about the men will bear it you understand
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was
how the de uce are you going to get out it must all be done by
to morrow morning it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a
service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community that it
fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he nailed up
the coffins and helped the grave digger at the cemetery that the nun
who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which
had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of
the chapel that the police regulations forbade this but that she was
one of those dead to whom nothing is refused that the prioress and the
vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased that it was
so much the worse for the government that he fauchelevent was to nail
up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the
corpse into the vault and that by way of thanks the prioress was to
admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil
that his brother was m madeleine and that his niece was cosette that
the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening
after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery but that he could not
bring m madeleine in from the outside if m madeleine was not outside
that that was the first problem and then that there was another the
what is that empty coffin asked jean valjean
a nun dies the municipal doctor comes and says a nun has died
the government sends a coffin the next day it sends a hearse and
undertakers men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery the
undertakers men will come and lift the coffin there will be nothing in
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under
jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his
face like a flash from heaven in the winter
you know fauchelevent what you have said mother crucifixion is
dead and i add and father madeleine is buried
ah good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously
very seriously i must get out of this place
l have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also
the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth
in the first place it will be a white cloth nuns are buried in
you are not like other men father madeleine
to behold such devices which are nothing else than the savage and
daring inventions of the galleys spring forth from the peaceable things
which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course
of life in the convent caused fauchelevent as much amazement as a
gull fishing in the gutter of the rue saint denis would inspire in a
the problem is to get out of here without being seen this offers
the means but give me some information in the first place how is it
down stairs in what is called the dead room it stands on two
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening
on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two
doors one leads into the convent the other into the church
the church in the street the church which any one can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the
porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the
coffin when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room
could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep
no but i could hide you in a small dark nook which opens on the
dead room where i keep my tools to use for burials and of which i have
at what time will the hearse come for the coffin to morrow
about three oclock in the afternoon the burial will take place at the
vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall it is not very near
i will remain concealed in your tool closet all night and all the
morning and how about food i shall be hungry
you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two oclock
bah impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
what seemed unprecedented to fauchelevent was we repeat a simple
matter to jean valjean jean valjean had been in worse straits than
this any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract
himself to fit the diameter of the escape the prisoner is subject to
flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him
an escape is a cure what does not a man undergo for the sake of a
cure to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale
of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is
none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without
dying this was one of jean valjeans gloomy talents
moreover a coffin containing a living being that convicts
expedient is also an imperial expedient if we are to credit the monk
austin castillejo this was the means employed by charles the fifth
desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication
he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of saint yuste
fauchelevent who had recovered himself a little exclaimed
in that box the mere thought of it suffocates me
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and
there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely
good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
father fauchelevent we must come to a decision i must either be
caught here or accept this escape through the hearse
every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging
between the two leaves of a half shut door who is there who has not
said to a cat do come in there are men who when an incident stands
half open before them have the same tendency to halt in indecision
between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the
abrupt closing of the adventure by fate the over prudent cats as they
are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than
the audacious fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature but
jean valjeans coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he
the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the
that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed
fauchelevent if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i
am sure of getting you out of the grave the grave digger is a drunkard
and a friend of mine he is father mestienne an old fellow of the old
school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the
grave digger in my pocket i will tell you what will take place they
will arrive a little before dusk three quarters of an hour before the
gates of the cemetery are closed the hearse will drive directly up to
the grave i shall follow that is my business i shall have a hammer
a chisel and some pincers in my pocket the hearse halts the
undertakers men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down the
priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy
water and takes his departure i am left alone with father mestienne
he is my friend i tell you one of two things will happen he will
either be sober or he will not be sober if he is not drunk i shall
say to him come and drink a bout while the bon coing the good quince
is open i carry him off i get him drunk it does not take long to
make father mestienne drunk he always has the beginning of it about
him i lay him under the table i take his card so that i can get into
the cemetery again and i return without him then you have no longer
any one but me to deal with if he is drunk i shall say to him be
off i will do your work for you off he goes and i drag you out of
jean valjean held out his hand and fauchelevent precipitated himself
upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant
that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
provided nothing goes wrong thought fauchelevent in that case it
chapter v it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal
on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by
on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old fashioned
hearse ornamented with skulls cross bones and tears this hearse
contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large
black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms a mourning coach in
which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red
cap followed two undertakers men in gray uniforms trimmed with black
walked on the right and the left of the hearse behind it came an old
man in the garments of a laborer who limped along the procession was
going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery
the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antennae of
a pair of pincers were visible protruding from the mans pocket
the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of
paris it had its peculiar usages just as it had its carriage
entrance and its house door which old people in the quarter who clung
tenaciously to ancient words still called the porte cavaliere and the
porte pietonne16 the bernardines benedictines of the rue petit picpus
had obtained permission as we have already stated to be buried there
in a corner apart and at night the plot of land having formerly
belonged to their community the grave diggers being thus bound to
service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this
cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline the gates of the
paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a
municipal regulation the vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the
rest the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated
gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect perronet and
inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery these gates therefore
swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared
behind the dome of the invalides if any grave digger were delayed
after that moment in the cemetery there was but one way for him to
get out his grave diggers card furnished by the department of public
funerals a sort of letter box was constructed in the porters window
the grave digger dropped his card into this box the porter heard it
fall pulled the rope and the small door opened if the man had not his
card he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and
asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with
his key the grave digger stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen
this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations
embarrassed the symmetry of the administration it was suppressed
a little later than 1830 the cemetery of mont parnasse called the
eastern cemetery succeeded to it and inherited that famous dram shop
next to the vaugirard cemetery which was surmounted by a quince painted
on a board and which formed an angle one side on the drinkers tables
and the other on the tombs with this sign au bon coing
the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery it
was falling into disuse dampness was invading it the flowers were
deserting it the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in
the vaugirard it hinted at poverty pere lachaise if you please to be
buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany
it is recognized as elegant the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable
enclosure planted like an old fashioned french garden straight alleys
box thuya trees holly ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees and
very tall grass in the evening it was tragic there there were very
the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the
black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery the lame man
who followed it was no other than fauchelevent
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the
exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all
had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch
let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under
the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight it
is one of the faults which resemble a duty the nuns had committed it
not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own
consciences in the cloister what is called the government is only
an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always
questionable in the first place the rule as for the code we shall
see make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute
to god a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame
of mind his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent
the other against it the other with m madeleine had succeeded to
all appearance jean valjeans composure was one of those powerful
tranquillities which are contagious fauchelevent no longer felt
what remained to be done was a mere nothing within the last two years
he had made good father mestienne a chubby cheeked person drunk at
least ten times he played with father mestienne he did what he liked
with him he made him dance according to his whim mestiennes head
adjusted itself to the cap of fauchelevents will fauchelevents
at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the
cemetery fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse and said half
all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate the permission
for interment must be exhibited the undertakers man addressed himself
to the porter of the cemetery during this colloquy which always is
productive of a delay of from one to two minutes some one a stranger
came and placed himself behind the hearse beside fauchelevent he was
a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and
if a man could survive the blow of a cannon ball full in the breast he
would make the same face that fauchelevent made
fauchelevent had expected anything but this that a grave digger could
die it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves by
dint of excavating graves for other people one hollows out ones own
fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open he had hardly the
but he persisted feebly father mestienne is the grave digger
after napoleon louis xviii after mestienne gribier peasant my name
fauchelevent who was deadly pale stared at this gribier
he was a tall thin livid utterly funereal man he had the air of an
ah said he what queer things do happen father mestienne is dead
but long live little father lenoir do you know who little father lenoir
is he is a jug of red wine it is a jug of surene morbigou of real
paris surene ah so old mestienne is dead i am sorry for it he was
a jolly fellow but you are a jolly fellow too are you not comrade
well go and have a drink together presently
i have been a student i passed my fourth examination i never drink
the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the grand alley of the
fauchelevent had slackened his pace he limped more out of anxiety than
the grave digger walked on in front of him
fauchelevent passed the unexpected gribier once more in review
he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and
fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he
had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he
completely the good god consulted his note book which shows when the
time is up it was father mestiennes turn father mestienne died
the good god said the man authoritatively according to the
philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme
shall we not make each others acquaintance stammered fauchelevent
it is made you are a peasant i am a parisian
people do not know each other until they have drunk together he who
empties his glass empties his heart you must come and have a drink with
they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley
peasant i have seven small children who must be fed as they must eat
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a
their hunger is the enemy of my thirst
the hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees quitted the grand alley
turned into a narrow one entered the waste land and plunged into
a thicket this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of
sepulture fauchelevent slackened his pace but he could not detain the
hearse fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter
rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured fauchelevent
villager retorted the man i ought not be a grave digger my
father was a porter at the prytaneum town hall he destined me for
literature but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged
to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then returned fauchelevent clutching
the one does not hinder the other i cumulate
here a remark becomes necessary fauchelevent whatever his anguish
offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to
pay generally fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid an offer
of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the
new grave digger and it was necessary to make this offer but the old
gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in
the dark and that not unintentionally as for himself fauchelevent did
not wish to pay troubled as he was
the grave digger went on with a superior smile
one must eat i have accepted father mestiennes reversion one gets to
be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes to the labor
of the hand i join the labor of the arm i have my scriveners stall in
the market of the rue de sevres you know the umbrella market all the
cooks of the red cross apply to me i scribble their declarations of
love to the raw soldiers in the morning i write love letters in the
evening i dig graves such is life rustic
the hearse was still advancing fauchelevent uneasy to the last degree
was gazing about him on all sides great drops of perspiration trickled
but continued the grave digger a man cannot serve two mistresses
i must choose between the pen and the mattock the mattock is ruining my
the choir boy alighted from the mourning coach then the priest
one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a
pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible
what a farce this is repeated fauchelevent in consternation
who was in the coffin the reader knows jean valjean
jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he
it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers
security of the rest every combination thought out by jean valjean had
been progressing and progressing favorably since the preceding day
he like fauchelevent counted on father mestienne he had no doubt
as to the end never was there a more critical situation never more
the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace it
seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean
