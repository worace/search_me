on go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers
near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
move on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under
those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on
it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another
still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
on the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
hand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not know
how long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he was
alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head
where is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw
today was his first thought and i did not know this suffering
either he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all till
he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices
speaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same lofty
sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher and
between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did not
see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up
it was napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp bonaparte riding over
the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
fine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier who
with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his
stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide
the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your majesty
said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at
have some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone on
a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had already
been taken by the french as a trophy
thats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonski
prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
napoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but he
heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not only
did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew it
was napoleon his hero but at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a
small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between
himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it at
that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him or
what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing near
him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life
which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
understand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir and
utter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan
ah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and carry him
having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in
hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory
prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the
terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while
being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station he
did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other
wounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospital
during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
the first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a french
convoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperor will
pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen
there are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that
he is probably tired of them said another officer
all the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperor
alexanders guards said the first one indicating a russian officer in
bolkonski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburg
society beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of
bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse
which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners
you are the commander of the emperor alexanders regiment of horse
your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon
the praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward said
i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young man
hes very young to come to meddle with us
youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failing
a splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go far
prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperors
eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his
attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was
well and you young man said he how do you feel mon brave
though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a few
words to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixed
straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that moment
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did his
hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared
to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and
everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood
suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking into
napoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and
the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one
the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken to
my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoir
prince repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped away
his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure
the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the
little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck but
seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to
prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the
little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon his
sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence it
would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life
and what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm i
should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to whom
should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible
which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in
words the great all or nothing  said he to himself or to that god
who has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothing certain
nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand and
the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important
the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his father
wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and
above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious
the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented
itself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that little
napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments
had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning all
these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctor
larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence
he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recover
and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of
early in the year 1806 nicholas rostov returned home on leave denisov
was going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to travel with him
as far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a comrade at the
last post station but one before moscow denisov had drunk three bottles
of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the snow covered
road did not once wake up on the way to moscow but lay at the bottom
of the sleigh beside rostov who grew more and more impatient the nearer
how much longer how much longer oh these insufferable streets
shops bakers signboards street lamps and sleighs thought rostov
when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
denisov were here hes asleep he added leaning forward with his
whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
theres the corner at the crossroads where the cabman zakhar has his
stand and theres zakhar himself and still the same horse and heres
the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread cant you hurry up
why that one right at the end the big one dont you see thats our
house said rostov of course its our house denisov denisov were
denisov raised his head coughed and made no answer
dmitri said rostov to his valet on the box those lights are in our
yes sir and theres a light in your fathers study
then theyve not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now dont
forget to put out my new coat added rostov fingering his new
mustache now then get on he shouted to the driver do wake up
vaska he went on turning to denisov whose head was again nodding
come get on you shall have three rubles for vodka get on rostov
shouted when the sleigh was only three houses from his door it seemed
to him the horses were not moving at all at last the sleigh bore to the
right drew up at an entrance and rostov saw overhead the old familiar
cornice with a bit of plaster broken off the porch and the post by the
side of the pavement he sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran
into the hall the house stood cold and silent as if quite regardless
of who had come to it there was no one in the hall oh god is
everyone all right he thought stopping for a moment with a sinking
heart and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the
warped steps of the familiar staircase the well known old door handle
which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned
turned as loosely as ever a solitary tallow candle burned in the
old michael was asleep on the chest prokofy the footman who was so
strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat
plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges he looked up at the opening
door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
gracious heavens the young count he cried recognizing his young
master can it be my treasure and prokofy trembling with
excitement rushed toward the drawing room door probably in order to
announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss the
all well asked rostov drawing away his arm
yes god be thanked yes theyve just finished supper let me have a
rostov who had completely forgotten denisov not wishing anyone to
forestall him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
large dark ballroom all was the same there were the same old card
tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it but someone had
already seen the young master and before he had reached the drawing
room something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
hugging and kissing him another and yet another creature of the same
kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing
more outcries and tears of joy he could not distinguish which was
papa which natasha and which petya everyone shouted talked and
kissed him at the same time only his mother was not there he noticed
and i did not know nicholas my darling
here he is our own kolya  dear fellow how he has changed
sonya natasha petya anna mikhaylovna vera and the old count were
all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the room
petya clinging to his legs kept shouting and me too
natasha after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
with kisses holding him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and
pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly
all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all around
sonya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss
looked eagerly toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she
longed sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially at
this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not taking
her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath he gave her a
grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone the old
countess had not yet come but now steps were heard at the door steps
so rapid that they could hardly be his mothers
yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made since
he had left all the others let him go and he ran to her when they
met she fell on his breast sobbing she could not lift her face but
only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussars jacket denisov
who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped
vasili denisov your sons friend he said introducing himself to the
you are most welcome i know i know said the count kissing and
embracing denisov nicholas wrote us natasha vera look here is
the same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of denisov
darling denisov screamed natasha beside herself with rapture
springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this
escapade made everybody feel confused denisov blushed too but smiled
denisov was shown to the room prepared for him and the rostovs all
the old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every
movement word or look of his never taking their blissfully adoring
eyes off him his brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea
rostov was very happy in the love they showed him but the first moment
of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more
next morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept
in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers
satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots two freshly
cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall the servants
were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their well
brushed clothes there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco
hallo gwiska my pipe came vasili denisovs husky voice wostov
rostov rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his
late its nearly ten oclock answered natashas voice a rustle of
starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls voices
came from the adjoining room the door was opened a crack and there was
a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair and merry faces it
was natasha sonya and petya who had come to see whether they were
nicholas get up natashas voice was again heard at the door
meanwhile petya having found and seized the sabers in the outer room
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother and
forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed
the girls sprang aside denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket
looking with a scared face at his comrade for help the door having let
petya in closed again a sound of laughter came from behind it
nicholas come out in your dressing gown said natashas voice
is this your saber asked petya or is it yours he said addressing
rostov hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing gown
and went out natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
her foot into the other sonya when he came in was twirling round and
was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down they were
dressed alike in new pale blue frocks and were both fresh rosy and
bright sonya ran away but natasha taking her brothers arm led him
into the sitting room where they began talking they hardly gave one
another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves natasha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself not because what
they were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter
oh how nice how splendid she said to everything
rostov felt that under the influence of the warm rays of love that
childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
no but listen she said now you are quite a man arent you im
awfully glad youre my brother she touched his mustache i want to
know what you men are like are you the same as we no
ah yes thats a whole long story how are you going to speak to her
no call her you please ill tell you all about it some other time
no ill tell you now you know sonyas my dearest friend such a friend
that i burned my arm for her sake look here
she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long
slender delicate arm high above the elbow on that part that is covered
i burned this to prove my love for her i just heated a ruler in the
sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used
to be his old schoolroom and looking into natashas wildly bright eyes
rostov re entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning
for anyone else but gave him some of the best joys of his life and the
burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him
senseless he understood and was not surprised at it
we are such friends such friends all that ruler business was just
nonsense but we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does it
for life but i dont understand that i forget quickly
well she loves me and you like that
why you remember before you went away well she says you are to
forget all that she says i shall love him always but let him be
free isnt that lovely and noble yes very noble isnt it asked
natasha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she
was now saying she had talked of before with tears
i never go back on my word he said besides sonya is so charming
that only a fool would renounce such happiness
no no cried natasha she and i have already talked it over we knew
youd say so but it wont do because you see if you say that if you
consider yourself bound by your promise it will seem as if she had not
meant it seriously it makes it as if you were marrying her because you
rostov saw that it had been well considered by them sonya had already
struck him by her beauty on the preceding day today when he had caught
a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she was a charming girl
of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him he did not doubt
that for an instant why should he not love her now and even marry
her rostov thought but just now there were so many other pleasures and
interests before him yes they have taken a wise decision he
well then thats excellent said he well talk it over later on
oh how glad i am to have you
well and are you still true to boris he continued
oh what nonsense cried natasha laughing i dont think about him
or anyone else and i dont want anything of the kind
dear me then what are you up to now
now repeated natasha and a happy smile lit up her face have you
not seen duport the famous dancer well then you wont understand
curving her arms natasha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back a
few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply
together and made some steps on the very tips of her toes
see im standing see she said but could not maintain herself on
her toes any longer so thats what im up to ill never marry anyone
but will be a dancer only dont tell anyone
rostov laughed so loud and merrily that denisov in his bedroom felt
envious and natasha could not help joining in
no but dont you think its nice she kept repeating
nice and so you no longer wish to marry boris
natasha flared up i dont want to marry anyone and ill tell him so
but thats all rubbish natasha chattered on and is denisov nice
oh well then good by go and dress is he very terrible denisov
why terrible asked nicholas no vaska is a splendid fellow
you call him vaska thats funny and is he very nice
well then be quick well all have breakfast together
and natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet
dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when
rostov met sonya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know how
to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of
meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not be
done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with
her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you sonya
but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looks
asked him to forgive her for having dared by natashas intermediacy to
remind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love his looks
thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or
another he would never cease to love her for that would be impossible
how strange it is said vera selecting a moment when all were silent
that sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like
veras remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of
her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sonya
nicholas and natasha but even the old countess who dreading this
love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant match
denisov to rostovs surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded
hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he made
himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladies
and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see him
on his return to moscow from the army nicholas rostov was welcomed by
his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darling
nikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite young
man by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a good
dancer and one of the best matches in the city
the rostovs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enough
that year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholas
acquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut such as no one else yet had in moscow and boots of the
latest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs
passed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting himself to
the old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to be at
home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much his
despair at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money from
gavril to pay a sleigh driver his kissing sonya on the sly he now
recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind now
he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and
wearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery in
action and in the company of well known elderly and respected racing
men was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a lady on one
of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurka at
the arkharovs ball talked about the war with field marshal kamenski
visited the english club and was on intimate terms with a colonel of
his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still as
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spoke
about him and about his love for him letting it be understood that he
had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
emperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he shared
the adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken of
during rostovs short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he did
not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she was very
pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was at
the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time
for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes
his freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought of
sonya during this stay in moscow he said to himself ah there will
be and there are many more such girls somewhere whom i do not yet
know there will be time enough to think about love when i want to but
now i have no time besides it seemed to him that the society of women
was rather derogatory to his manhood he went to balls and into ladies
society with an affectation of doing so against his will the races the
english club sprees with denisov and visits to a certain house that
was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar
at the beginning of march old count ilya rostov was very busy arranging
a dinner in honor of prince bagration at the english club
the count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown giving
orders to the club steward and to the famous feoktist the clubs head
cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and fish for
this dinner the count had been a member and on the committee of the
club from the day it was founded to him the club entrusted the
arrangement of the festival in honor of bagration for few men knew so
well how to arrange a feast on an open handed hospitable scale and
still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete
the club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders with
pleased faces for they knew that under no other management could they
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
well then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup you know
shall we have three cold dishes then asked the cook
we cant have less yes three the mayonnaise thats one said he
then am i to order those large sterlets asked the steward
yes it cant be helped if they wont take less ah dear me i was
forgetting we must have another entree ah goodness gracious he
clutched at his head who is going to get me the flowers dmitri eh
dmitri gallop off to our moscow estate he said to the factotum who
appeared at his call hurry off and tell maksim the gardener to set
the serfs to work say that everything out of the hothouses must be
brought here well wrapped up in felt i must have two hundred pots here
having given several more orders he was about to go to his little
countess to have a rest but remembering something else of importance
he returned again called back the cook and the club steward and again
began giving orders a light footstep and the clinking of spurs were
heard at the door and the young count handsome rosy with a dark
little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in
ah my boy my heads in a whirl said the old man with a smile as if
he felt a little confused before his son now if you would only help a
bit i must have singers too i shall have my own orchestra but
shouldnt we get the gypsy singers as well you military men like that
really papa i believe prince bagration worried himself less before
the battle of schon grabern than you do now said his son with a smile
and the count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectful
expression looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
what have the young people come to nowadays eh feoktist said he
thats so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a good
dinner but providing it and serving it all up thats not their
thats it thats it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his son
by both hands he cried now ive got you so take the sleigh and pair
at once and go to bezukhovs and tell him count ilya has sent you to
ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples we cant get them from
anyone else hes not there himself so youll have to go in and ask the
princesses and from there go on to the rasgulyay the coachman ipatka
knows and look up the gypsy ilyushka the one who danced at count
orlovs you remember in a white cossack coat and bring him along to
and am i to bring the gypsy girls along with him asked nicholas
at that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike
preoccupied yet meekly christian look which never left her face anna
mikhaylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count in his
dressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her to
no matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing her eyes
but ill go to bezukhovs myself pierre has arrived and now we shall
get anything we want from his hothouses i have to see him in any case
he has forwarded me a letter from boris thank god boris is now on the
the count was delighted at anna mikhaylovnas taking upon herself one of
his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her
tell bezukhov to come ill put his name down is his wife with him
anna mikhaylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was depicted
ah my dear friend he is very unfortunate she said if what we hear
is true it is dreadful how little we dreamed of such a thing when we
were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul as young
bezukhov yes i pity him from my heart and shall try to give him what
wh what is the matter asked both the young and old rostov
dolokhov mary ivanovnas son she said in a mysterious whisper has
compromised her completely they say pierre took him up invited him to
his house in petersburg and now she has come here and that daredevil
after her said anna mikhaylovna wishing to show her sympathy for
pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her
sympathy for the daredevil as she called dolokhov they say pierre
dear dear but still tell him to come to the club it will all blow
next day the third of march soon after one oclock two hundred and
fifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting the
guest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagration to
on the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow had
been bewildered at that time the russians were so used to victories
that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it
while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
event in the english club where all who were distinguished important
and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
december nothing was said about the war and the last battle as though
all were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tone in
conversation count rostopchin prince yuri dolgorukov valuev count
markov and prince vyazemski did not show themselves at the club but
met in private houses in intimate circles and the moscovites who took
their opinions from others ilya rostov among them remained for a while
without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without
leaders the moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to
discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent but
after a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs who
guided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybody began speaking
clearly and definitely reasons were found for the incredible unheard
of and impossible event of a russian defeat everything became clear
and in all corners of moscow the same things began to be said these
reasons were the treachery of the austrians a defective commissariat
the treachery of the pole przebyszewski and of the frenchman langeron
kutuzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperience
of the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant people
but the army the russian army everyone declared was extraordinary and
had achieved miracles of valor the soldiers officers and generals
were heroes but the hero of heroes was prince bagration distinguished
by his schon grabern affair and by the retreat from austerlitz where he
alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an
enemy force twice as numerous as his own what also conduced to
bagrations being selected as moscows hero was the fact that he had no
connections in the city and was a stranger there in his person honor
was shown to a simple fighting russian soldier without connections and
intrigues and to one who was associated by memories of the italian
campaign with the name of suvorov moreover paying such honor to
bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of
had there been no bagration it would have been necessary to invent
him said the wit shinshin parodying the words of voltaire kutuzov no
one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers calling him a
all moscow repeated prince dolgorukovs saying if you go on modeling
and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation for
our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of
rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battle by
highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them that it
is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russian soldiers
only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and fresh
anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our
officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard another had
killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded berg
was mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded in
the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward of
bolkonski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimately
regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with his
on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filled
with a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime
the members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat
stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress
and a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftans
powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings
stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order
to offer their services most of those present were elderly respected
men with broad self confident faces fat fingers and resolute gestures
and voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those present
were casual guests chiefly young men among whom were denisov rostov
and dolokhov who was now again an officer in the semenov regiment the
faces of these young people especially those who were military men
bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which
seems to say to the older generation we are prepared to respect and
honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to us
nesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at his
wifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles went
about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here as
elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his
wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he
by his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealth
and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests and
so he went from one group to another some of the most important old men
were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
to hear the voices of well known men the largest circles formed round
count rostopchin valuev and naryshkin rostopchin was describing how
the russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had to
valuev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent from
petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz
in the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
austrian council of war at which suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to
the nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshin standing close
by tried to make a joke saying that kutuzov had evidently failed to
learn from suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him feel
that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so of
count ilya rostov hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft boots
between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and
unimportant all of whom he knew as if they were all equals while his
eyes occasionally sought out his fine well set up young son resting on
him and winking joyfully at him young rostov stood at a window with
dolokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued the
old count came up to them and pressed dolokhovs hand
please come and visit us you know my brave boy been together out
there both playing the hero ah vasili ignatovich how dye do
old fellow he said turning to an old man who was passing but before
he had finished his greeting there was a general stir and a footman who
had run in announced with a frightened face hes arrived
bells rang the stewards rushed forward and like rye shaken together
in a shovel the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword
which in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hall
porter he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whip
over his shoulder as when rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle
of austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreign
orders and the star of st george on his left breast evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed
which changed his appearance for the worse there was something naively
festive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virile
features gave him a rather comical expression bekleshev and theodore
uvarov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow him as
the guest of honor to enter first bagration was embarrassed not
wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay
at the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shyly
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing
what to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
field under fire as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment at
schon grabern and he would have found that easier the committeemen met
him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such a
highly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waiting
for his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it was
at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at
bagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rare animal
count ilya rostov laughing and repeating the words make way dear
boy make way make way pushed through the crowd more energetically
than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and seated them on
the center sofa the bigwigs the most respected members of the club
beset the new arrivals count ilya again thrusting his way through the
crowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with
another committeeman carrying a large silver salver which he presented
to prince bagration on the salver lay some verses composed and printed
in the heros honor bagration on seeing the salver glanced around in
dismay as though seeking help but all eyes demanded that he should
submit feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the salver
with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who
had presented it to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagration
or he would it seemed have held it till evening and have gone in to
dinner with it and drew his attention to the verses
well i will read them then bagration seemed to say and fixing his
weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and serious
expression but the author himself took the verses and began reading
them aloud bagration bowed his head and listened
bring glory then to alexanders reign and on the throne our titus
shield a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man a rhipheus at home
a caesar in the field een fortunate napoleon knows by experience now
but before he had finished reading a stentorian major domo announced
that dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room came
conquests joyful thunder waken triumph valiant russians now
and count rostov glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his
verses bowed to bagration everyone rose feeling that dinner was more
important than verses and bagration again preceding all the rest went
in to dinner he was seated in the place of honor between two
alexanders bekleshev and naryshkin which was a significant allusion to
the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took their seats in the
dining room according to their rank and importance the more important
nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flows deepest where
just before dinner count ilya rostov presented his son to bagration
who recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkward
as were all the words he spoke that day and count ilya looked joyfully
and proudly around while bagration spoke to his son
nicholas rostov with denisov and his new acquaintance dolokhov sat
almost at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre beside prince
nesvitski count ilya rostov with the other members of the committee sat
facing bagration and as the very personification of moscow hospitality
his efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and the
other fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
end of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to the
footmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everything
was excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of
which ilya rostov blushed with self conscious pleasure the footmen
began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the fish
which made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with the
other committeemen there will be many toasts its time to begin he
whispered and taking up his glass he rose all were silent waiting
to the health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at the same
moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm the
band immediately struck up conquests joyful thunder waken all rose
and cried hurrah bagration also rose and shouted hurrah in exactly
the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at schon grabern
young rostovs ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred
others he nearly wept to the health of our sovereign the emperor
he roared hurrah and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to
the floor many followed his example and the loud shouting continued
for a long time when the voices subsided the footmen cleared away the
broken glass and everybody sat down again smiling at the noise they had
