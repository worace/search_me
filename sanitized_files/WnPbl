and a plan these he put down beside him not letting anyone read them
on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and
spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
eyes upon it told her to read the letter aloud when she had done so
princess mary looked inquiringly at her father he was examining the
what do you think of it prince dessalles ventured to ask
i i said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened and not taking
his eyes from the plan of the building
very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that
ha ha ha the theater of war said the prince i have said and still
say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get
dessalles looked in amazement at the prince who was talking of the
niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper but princess mary
forgetting the geographical position of the niemen thought that what
when the snow melts theyll sink in the polish swamps only they could
fail to see it the prince continued evidently thinking of the
campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent bennigsen should have
advanced into prussia sooner then things would have taken a different
but prince dessalles began timidly the letter mentions
ah the letter yes replied the prince peevishly yes yes
his face suddenly took on a morose expression he paused yes he
writes that the french were beaten at at what river is it
the prince says nothing about that he remarked gently
doesnt he but i didnt invent it myself
yes yes well michael ivanovich he suddenly went on raising
his head and pointing to the plan of the building tell me how you mean
michael ivanovich went up to the plan and the prince after speaking to
him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and
princess mary saw dessalles embarrassed and astonished look fixed on
her father noticed his silence and was struck by the fact that her
father had forgotten his sons letter on the drawing room table but she
was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his
confusion and silence but was afraid even to think about it
in the evening michael ivanovich sent by the prince came to princess
mary for prince andrews letter which had been forgotten in the drawing
room she gave it to him and unpleasant as it was to her to do so
ventured to ask him what her father was doing
always busy replied michael ivanovich with a respectfully ironic
smile which caused princess mary to turn pale hes worrying very much
about the new building he has been reading a little but now michael
ivanovich went on lowering his voice now hes at his desk busy with
his will i expect one of the princes favorite occupations of late
had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
and alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary
oh yes he has been waiting to start for some time
when michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter the old
prince with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes was sitting at his
open bureau with screened candles holding a paper in his outstretched
hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript
his remarks as he termed it which was to be transmitted to the
when michael ivanovich went in there were tears in the princes eyes
evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
been written he took the letter from michael ivanovichs hand put it
in his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpatych who had long
the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and walking up
and down the room past alpatych who stood by the door he gave his
first notepaper do you hear eight quires like this sample gilt
edged it must be exactly like the sample varnish sealing wax as in
he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes
then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed
next bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be
of a special shape the prince had himself designed and a leather case
had to be ordered to keep the will in
the instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the prince
did not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed his eyes and
well go go if anything more is wanted ill send after you
alpatych went out the prince again went to his bureau glanced into it
fingered his papers closed the bureau again and sat down at the table
it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter he wished to
sleep but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
thoughts came to him in bed so he called tikhon and went through the
rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night
he went about looking at every corner every place seemed
unsatisfactory but worst of all was his customary couch in the study
that couch was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive
thoughts he had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory everywhere
but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than
other places he had never slept there yet
with the help of a footman tikhon brought in the bedstead and began
thats not right thats not right cried the prince and himself
pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again
well at last ive finished now ill rest thought the prince and
frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his
coat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on the bed
and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his
withered yellow legs he was not meditating but only deferring the
moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
bed ugh how hard it is oh that this toil might end and you would
release me thought he pressing his lips together he made that effort
for the twenty thousandth time and lay down but hardly had he done so
before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if
it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost every
night he opened his eyes as they were closing
no peace damn them he muttered angry he knew not with whom ah
yes there was something else important very important that i was
keeping till i should be in bed the bolts no i told him about them
no it was something something in the drawing room princess mary
talked some nonsense dessalles that fool said something something in
tikhon what did we talk about at dinner
be quiet quiet the prince slapped his hand on the table yes i
know prince andrews letter princess mary read it dessalles said
he had the letter taken from his pocket and the table on which stood a
glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle moved close to the bed and
putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in the stillness of
the night reading it by the faint light under the green shade did he
the french at vitebsk in four days march they may be at smolensk
perhaps are already there tikhon tikhon jumped up no no i dont
he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and there
rose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian camp
and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face
vigorous and alert entering potemkins gaily colored tent and a
burning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him now as strongly
as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first
meeting with potemkin and he saw before him a plump rather sallow
faced short stout woman the empress mother with her smile and her
words at her first gracious reception of him and then that same face on
the catafalque and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffin
oh quicker quicker to get back to that time and have done with all
the present quicker quicker and that they should leave me in peace
bald hills prince nicholas bolkonskis estate lay forty miles east
from smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscow
the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatych
dessalles having asked to see princess mary told her that as the
prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety
though from prince andrews letter it was evident that to remain at bald
hills might be dangerous he respectfully advised her to send a letter
by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk asking him to let
her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bald
hills was exposed dessalles wrote this letter to the governor for
princess mary she signed it and it was given to alpatych with
instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as
having received all his orders alpatych wearing a white beaver hat a
present from the prince and carrying a stick as the prince did went
out accompanied by his family three well fed roans stood ready
harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood
the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed
with paper the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with
ringing bells but on a long journey alpatych liked to have them his
satellites the senior clerk a countinghouse clerk a scullery maid a
cook two old women a little pageboy the coachman and various
his daughter placed chintz covered down cushions for him to sit on and
behind his back his old sister in law popped in a small bundle and one
of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle
there there womens fuss women women said alpatych puffing and
speaking rapidly just as the prince did and he climbed into the trap
after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done alpatych not
trying to imitate the prince now lifted the hat from his bald head and
if there is anything come back yakov alpatych for christs sake
think of us cried his wife referring to the rumors of war and the
women women womens fuss muttered alpatych to himself and started
on his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still
green thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just being
as he went along he looked with pleasure at the years splendid crop of
corn scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
already being reaped made his calculations as to the sowing and the
harvest and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
having baited the horses twice on the way he arrived at the town toward
alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the
road as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing
but these did not impress him what struck him most was the sight of a
splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was
being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder this fact
impressed alpatych but in thinking about his own business he soon
all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
bounded by the will of the prince and he never went beyond that limit
everything not connected with the execution of the princes orders did
not interest and did not even exist for alpatych
on reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in
the gachina suburb across the dnieper at the inn kept by ferapontov
where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years
some thirty years ago ferapontov by alpatychs advice had bought a
wood from the prince had begun to trade and now had a house an inn
and a corn dealers shop in that province he was a stout dark red
faced peasant in the forties with thick lips a broad knob of a nose
similar knobs over his black frowning brows and a round belly
wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt ferapontov was standing
before his shop which opened onto the street on seeing alpatych he went
youre welcome yakov alpatych folks are leaving the town but you
why are they leaving the town asked alpatych
thats what i say folks are foolish always afraid of the french
just what i think yakov alpatych what i say is orders have been
given not to let them in so that must be right and the peasants are
asking three rubles for carting it isnt christian
yakov alpatych heard without heeding he asked for a samovar and for hay
for his horses and when he had had his tea he went to bed
all night long troops were moving past the inn next morning alpatych
donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business it was a
sunny morning and by eight oclock it was already hot a good day for
from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning at eight
oclock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry many
people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers
but cabs were still driving about tradesmen stood at their shops and
service was being held in the churches as usual alpatych went to the
shops to government offices to the post office and to the governors
in the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking
about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town
everybody was asking what should be done and all were trying to calm
in front of the governors house alpatych found a large number of
people cossacks and a traveling carriage of the governors at the
porch he met two of the landed gentry one of whom he knew this man an
its no joke you know its all very well if youre single one man
though undone is but one as the proverb says but with thirteen in
your family and all the property theyve brought us to utter ruin
what sort of governors are they to do that they ought to be hanged the
what do i care let him hear were not dogs said the ex captain of
oh yakov alpatych what have you come for
to see the governor by his excellencys order answered alpatych
lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his
coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince he has ordered
me to inquire into the position of affairs he added
yes go and find out shouted the angry gentleman theyve brought
things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything there it
is again do you hear said he pointing in the direction whence came
theyve brought us all to ruin the brigands he repeated and
alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs in the waiting room were
tradesmen women and officials looking silently at one another the
door of the governors room opened and they all rose and moved forward
an official ran out said some words to a merchant called a stout
official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him and vanished
again evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
addressed to him alpatych moved forward and next time the official came
out addressed him one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat
to his honor baron asch from general in chief prince bolkonski he
announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
a few minutes later the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to
inform the prince and princess that i knew nothing i acted on the
highest instructions here and he handed a paper to alpatych
still as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to
moscow i am just starting myself inform them
but the governor did not finish a dusty perspiring officer ran into the
room and began to say something in french the governors face expressed
go he said nodding his head to alpatych and began questioning the
eager frightened helpless glances were turned on alpatych when he came
out of the governors room involuntarily listening now to the firing
which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength alpatych hurried
to his inn the paper handed to him by the governor said this
i assure you that the town of smolensk is not in the slightest danger
as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any i from
the one side and prince bagration from the other are marching to unite
our forces before smolensk which junction will be effected on the 22nd
instant and both armies with their united forces will defend our
compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
shall have beaten back the enemies of our fatherland or till the last
warrior in our valiant ranks has perished from this you will see that
you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of smolensk for
those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory
instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch the civil governor of
carts piled high with household utensils chairs and cupboards kept
emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets
loaded carts stood at the house next to ferapontovs and women were
wailing and lamenting as they said good by a small watchdog ran round
alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
straight to the shed where his horses and trap were the coachman was
asleep he woke him up told him to harness and went into the passage
from the hosts room came the sounds of a child crying the despairing
sobs of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov the cook
began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen
hes done her to death killed the mistress beat her dragged her
she kept begging to go away shes a woman take me away says she
dont let me perish with my little children folks she says are all
gone so why she says dont we go and he began beating and pulling
at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to
hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeepers where
you brute you murderer screamed a thin pale woman who with a baby
in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head burst through the door
at that moment and down the steps into the yard
ferapontov came out after her but on seeing alpatych adjusted his
waistcoat smoothed his hair yawned and followed alpatych into the
alpatych without answering or looking at his host sorted his packages
well reckon up well have you been to the governors asked
alpatych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite
with our business how can we get away said ferapontov wed have to
pay seven rubles a cartload to dorogobuzh and i tell them theyre not
christians to ask it selivanov now did a good stroke last thursday
sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack will you have some tea
while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their
tea talked of the price of corn the crops and the good weather for
well it seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapontov finishing
his third cup of tea and getting up ours must have got the best of it
the orders were not to let them in so were in force it seems they
say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the river
marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day
alpatych collected his parcels handed them to the coachman who had come
in and settled up with the innkeeper the noise of wheels hoofs and
bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out
it was by now late in the afternoon half the street was in shadow the
other half brightly lit by the sun alpatych looked out of the window
and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a far off whistling
and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull
he went out into the street two men were running past toward the
bridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these sounds
were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants the town was
being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered
up after four oclock the people did not at once realize the meaning of
at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
curiosity ferapontovs wife who till then had not ceased wailing under
the shed became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate
listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people
the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively curiosity
everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
their heads several people came round the corner talking eagerly
what force remarked one knocked the roof and ceiling all to
routed up the earth like a pig said another
thats grand it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you jumped
aside or it would have wiped you out
others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
on a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with the
swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeable
intermittent whistle of a shell flew over peoples heads incessantly
but not one fell close by they all flew over alpatych was getting into
his trap the innkeeper stood at the gate
what are you staring at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirt
with sleeves rolled up swinging her bare elbows had stepped to the
corner to listen to what was being said
what marvels she exclaimed but hearing her masters voice she turned
once more something whistled but this time quite close swooping
downwards like a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the
street something exploded and the street was shrouded in smoke
scoundrel what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to the
at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
sides the frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silently
with pale faces round the cook the loudest sound in that crowd was her
oh h h dear souls dear kind souls dont let me die my good
five minutes later no one remained in the street the cook with her
thigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchen
alpatych his coachman ferapontovs wife and children and the house
porter were all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns the
whistling of projectiles and the piteous moaning of the cook which
rose above the other sounds did not cease for a moment the mistress
rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in
a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in
the street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone
with others to the cathedral whence they were fetching the wonder
toward dusk the cannonade began to subside alpatych left the cellar and
stopped in the doorway the evening sky that had been so clear was
clouded with smoke through which high up the sickle of the new moon
shone strangely now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush
seemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of footsteps
the moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemed
widespread everywhere the cooks moans had now subsided on two sides
black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires through
the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
different directions like ants from a ruined ant hill several of them
ran into ferapontovs yard before alpatychs eyes alpatych went out to
the gate a retreating regiment thronging and hurrying blocked the
noticing him an officer said the town is being abandoned get away
get away and then turning to the soldiers shouted
ill teach you to run into the yards
alpatych went back to the house called the coachman and told him to
set off ferapontovs whole household came out too following alpatych
and the coachman the women who had been silent till then suddenly
began to wail as they looked at the fires the smoke and even the flames
of which could be seen in the failing twilight and as if in reply the
same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street
inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and
as alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
ferapontovs open shop talking loudly and filling their bags and
knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds just then ferapontov returned
and entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at
them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair burst into sobs
loot everything lads dont let those devils get it he cried taking
some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street
some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away others went on
filling their bags on seeing alpatych ferapontov turned to him
russia is done for he cried alpatych ill set the place on fire
myself were done for and ferapontov ran into the yard
soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it
completely so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait
ferapontovs wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
night had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
amid the smoke that screened it on the sloping descent to the dnieper
alpatychs cart and that of the innkeepers wife which were slowly
moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles had to stop in
a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped a
house and some shops were on fire this fire was already burning itself
out the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke now
suddenly flared up again brightly lighting up with strange distinctness
the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads black figures
flitted about before the fire and through the incessant crackling of
the flames talking and shouting could be heard seeing that his trap
would not be able to move on for some time alpatych got down and turned
into the side street to look at the fire soldiers were continually
rushing backwards and forwards near it and he saw two of them and a man
in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
blazing briskly the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen
in the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters were alight the
crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in and alpatych
alpatych a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man
mercy on us your excellency answered alpatych immediately
prince andrew in his riding cloak mounted on a black horse was looking
at alpatych from the back of the crowd
your your excellency stammered alpatych and broke into sobs are
at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masters pale
worn face alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
are we really quite lost your excellency he asked again
prince andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
began writing in pencil on a page he tore out he wrote to his sister
smolensk is being abandoned bald hills will be occupied by the enemy
within a week set off immediately for moscow let me know at once when
you will start send by special messenger to usvyazh
having written this and given the paper to alpatych he told him how to
arrange for departure of the prince the princess his son and the
boys tutor and how and where to let him know immediately before he
had had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of staff
followed by a suite galloped up to him
you are a colonel shouted the chief of staff with a german accent in
a voice familiar to prince andrew houses are set on fire in your
presence and you stand by what does this mean you will answer for it
shouted berg who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the
commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army a place
as berg said very agreeable and well en evidence
prince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
so tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth and if by the
tenth i dont receive news that they have all got away i shall have to
throw up everything and come myself to bald hills
prince said berg recognizing prince andrew i only spoke because i
have to obey orders because i always do obey exactly you must
something cracked in the flames the fire died down for a moment and
wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof there was another
ou rou rou yelled the crowd echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
of the barn the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
around the flames flared up again lighting the animated delighted
the man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted
its fine lads now its raging its fine
well then continued prince andrew to alpatych report to them as i
have told you and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside
him he touched his horse and rode down the side street
from smolensk the troops continued to retreat followed by the enemy on
the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching
along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills heat and
drought had continued for more than three weeks each day fleecy clouds
floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun but toward
evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish brown mist
heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped corn was
scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up the cattle lowed from
hunger finding no food on the sun parched meadows only at night and in
the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on the
road the highroad along which the troops marched there was no such
freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest the
dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches
deep as soon as day dawned the march began the artillery and baggage
wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
hubs of the wheels and the infantry sank ankle deep in that soft
choking hot dust that never cooled even at night some of this dust was
kneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like a
cloud over the troops settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils and
worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
road the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust and
through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
eye at the sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
sky there was no wind and the men choked in that motionless
atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
mouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells
and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud
prince andrew was in command of a regiment and the management of that
regiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and
giving orders engrossed him the burning of smolensk and its
abandonment made an epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger against
the foe made him forget his own sorrow he was entirely devoted to the
affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
officers in the regiment they called him our prince were proud of
him and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to those of his
regiment to timokhin and the like people quite new to him belonging
to a different world and who could not know and understand his past as
soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff
he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful ironical and
contemptuous everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
him and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair
in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
prince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth
of august he considered that it could and should have been defended
and after his sick father had had to flee to moscow abandoning to
pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled
but despite this thanks to his regiment prince andrew had something to
think about entirely apart from general questions two days previously
he had received news that his father son and sister had left for
moscow and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills prince
andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that
he ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on the
march rode to his fathers estate where he had been born and spent his
childhood riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of
women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden
beetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that
the little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged was
floating on its side in the middle of the pond he rode to the keepers
lodge no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door
stood open grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths and
horses and calves were straying in the english park prince andrew rode
up to the hothouse some of the glass panes were broken and of the
trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up he called for
taras the gardener but no one replied having gone round the corner of
the hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved garden
fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with
the fruit an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often
seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat plaiting a bast
he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting on
the seat the old prince used to like to sit on and beside him strips of
bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia
prince andrew rode up to the house several limes in the old garden had
been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
the house among the rosebushes the shutters were all closed except at
one window which was open a little serf boy seeing prince andrew ran
into the house alpatych having sent his family away was alone at bald
hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints on
hearing that prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles on
his nose buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a word
then vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report on
the position of affairs everything precious and valuable had been
removed to bogucharovo seventy quarters of grain had also been carted
away the hay and the spring corn of which alpatych said there had been
a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the troops and
mown down while still green the peasants were ruined some of them too
had gone to bogucharovo only a few remained
without waiting to hear him out prince andrew asked
when did my father and sister leave meaning when did they leave for
alpatych understanding the question to refer to their departure for
bogucharovo replied that they had left on the seventh and again went
into details concerning the estate management asking for instructions
am i to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for them
we have still six hundred quarters left he inquired
what am i to say to him thought prince andrew looking down on the
old mans bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
were and only asked them to allay his grief
yes let them have it replied prince andrew
if you noticed some disorder in the garden said alpatych it was
impossible to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent the
night dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of their
commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it
well and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemy
alpatych turned his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly
he is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed
a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward
well good by said prince andrew bending over to alpatych you must
go away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
ryazan estate or to the one near moscow
alpatych clung to prince andrews leg and burst into sobs gently
disengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a fly
impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last on
which he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running out
from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from
the trees there came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master
the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
hand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up some
prince andrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them see
that they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightened
little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistible
desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
when seeing these girls he realized the existence of other human
interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
that occupied him evidently these girls passionately desired one thing
to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught and
prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he
could not resist looking at them once more believing their danger past
they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrill
little voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburned
feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass
prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty
highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald hills
he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
place by the dam of a small pond it was past one oclock the sun a
red ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerably
through his black coat the dust always hung motionless above the buzz
of talk that came from the resting troops there was no wind as he
crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the
pond he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be and
he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
laughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than a
foot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies of
soldiers with brick red hands necks and faces who were splashing
about in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shrieking
floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering
can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
one fair haired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew
knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himself
stepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another a
dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to his
waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands
blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another
everywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthy
white muscular flesh the officer timokhin with his red little nose
standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused at seeing
the prince but made up his mind to address him nevertheless
its very nice your excellency wouldnt you like to said he
its dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace
well clear it out for you in a minute said timokhin and still
undressed ran off to clear the men out of the pond
what prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste to
clear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that he
would rather wash himself with water in the barn
flesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his own
naked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust and
horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that
immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond
on the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from his
dear count alexis andreevich he was writing to arakcheev but knew that
his letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed every
word in it to the best of his ability
i expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported the
abandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and the
whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
wantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally most urgently
and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear
to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk our
troops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand
men i held the enemy at bay for thirty five hours and beat him but he
would not hold out even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stain
on our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live if
he reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps about
four thousand not more and not even that but even were they ten
thousand thats war but the enemy has lost masses
what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would
have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men or
horses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sent
instructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in this
way or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow
there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that you
should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats you
would set all russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed
to wear the uniform if it has come to this we must fight as long as
russia can and as long as there are men able to stand
one man ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhaps
be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad but
execrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country i
am really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly it is clear
that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that the
minister should command the army does not love our sovereign and
desires the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out the
militia for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow
in a most masterly way the whole army feels great suspicion of the
imperial aide de camp wolzogen he is said to be more napoleons man
than ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civil
to him but obey him like a corporal though i am his senior this is
painful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i am
sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he
consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the
hospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this would
not have happened tell me for gods sake what will russia our mother
russia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning our
good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and of whom
are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating a
coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole army
bewails it and calls down curses upon him
among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human
life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and
those in which form prevails to the latter as distinguished from
village country provincial or even moscow life we may allot
petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the
salons is unchanging since the year 1805 we had made peace and had
again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
them again but the salons of anna pavlovna and helene remained just as
they had been the one seven and the other five years before at anna
pavlovnas they talked with perplexity of bonapartes successes just as
before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which was
to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna
pavlovna was the representative and in helenes salon which rumyantsev
himself honored with his visits regarding helene as a remarkably
intelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808
of the great nation and the great man and regretted our rupture
with france a rupture which according to them ought to be promptly
of late since the emperors return from the army there had been some
excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of
hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency in
anna pavlovnas circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep
rooted legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effect
that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the
french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps
the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports most
flattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of helene
and rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war
were contradicted and all napoleons attempts at conciliation were
discussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried
preparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girls
educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress
in helenes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal
demonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the view
prevailed expressed by bilibin who now in petersburg was quite at home
in helenes house which every clever man was obliged to visit that not
by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled in
that circle the moscow enthusiasm news of which had reached petersburg
simultaneously with the emperors return was ridiculed sarcastically
anna pavlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
