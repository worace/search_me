a tall lance planted in the ground and hanging from it by two cords of
green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following
inscription in large gold letters the illustrious knight don quixote of
la mancha has by merely attempting it finished and concluded the
adventure of the countess trifaldi otherwise called the distressed
duenna malambruno is now satisfied on every point the chins of the
duennas are now smooth and clean and king don clavijo and queen
antonomasia in their original form and when the squirely flagellation
shall have been completed the white dove shall find herself delivered
from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her and in the arms of
her beloved mate for such is the decree of the sage merlin
as soon as don quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he
perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of dulcinea and
returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger
achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the
countenances of those venerable duennas he advanced towards the duke and
duchess who had not yet come to themselves and taking the duke by the
hand he said be of good cheer worthy sir be of good cheer its
nothing at all the adventure is now over and without any harm done as
the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly
the duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness
after a heavy sleep and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate
about the garden did the same with such demonstrations of wonder and
amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they
pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality the duke
read the placard with half shut eyes and then ran to embrace don quixote
with open arms declaring him to be the best knight that had ever been
seen in any age sancho kept looking about for the distressed one to see
what her face was like without the beard and if she was as fair as her
elegant person promised but they told him that the instant clavileno
descended flaming through the air and came to the ground the whole band
of duennas with the trifaldi vanished and that they were already shaved
the duchess asked sancho how he had fared on that long journey to which
sancho replied i felt senora that we were flying through the region
of fire as my master told me and i wanted to uncover my eyes for a bit
but my master when i asked leave to uncover myself would not let me
but as i have a little bit of curiosity about me and a desire to know
what is forbidden and kept from me quietly and without anyone seeing me
i drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little close to
my nose and from underneath looked towards the earth and it seemed to
me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed and
that the men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts so you may
see how high we must have got to then
to this the duchess said sancho my friend mind what you are saying
it seems you could not have seen the earth but only the men walking on
it for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed and each
man like a hazel nut one man alone would have covered the whole earth
that is true said sancho but for all that i got a glimpse of a bit
of one side of it and saw it all
take care sancho said the duchess with a bit of one side one does
not see the whole of what one looks at
i dont understand that way of looking at things said sancho i only
know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we were
flying by enchantment so i might have seen the whole earth and all the
men by enchantment whatever way i looked and if you wont believe this
no more will you believe that uncovering myself nearly to the eyebrows
i saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm and a half
between me and it and by everything that i can swear by senora it is
mighty great and it so happened we came by where the seven goats are
and by god and upon my soul as in my youth i was a goatherd in my own
country as soon as i saw them i felt a longing to be among them for a
little and if i had not given way to it i think id have burst so i
come and take and what do i do without saying anything to anybody not
even to my master softly and quietly i got down from clavileno and
amused myself with the goats which are like violets like flowers for
nigh three quarters of an hour and clavileno never stirred or moved from
and while the good sancho was amusing himself with the goats said the
duke how did senor don quixote amuse himself
to which don quixote replied as all these things and such like
occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature it is no wonder
that sancho says what he does for my own part i can only say that i did
not uncover my eyes either above or below nor did i see sky or earth or
sea or shore it is true i felt that i was passing through the region of
the air and even that i touched that of fire but that we passed farther
i cannot believe for the region of fire being between the heaven of the
moon and the last region of the air we could not have reached that
heaven where the seven goats sancho speaks of are without being burned
and as we were not burned either sancho is lying or sancho is dreaming
i am neither lying nor dreaming said sancho only ask me the tokens
of those same goats and youll see by that whether im telling the truth
tell us them then sancho said the duchess
two of them said sancho are green two blood red two blue and one
an odd sort of goat that said the duke in this earthly region of
ours we have no such colours i mean goats of such colours
thats very plain said sancho of course there must be a difference
between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth
tell me sancho said the duke did you see any he goat among those
no senor said sancho but i have heard say that none ever passed the
they did not care to ask him anything more about his journey for they
saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an
account of everything that went on there without having ever stirred
from the garden such in short was the end of the adventure of the
distressed duenna which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not
only for the time being but for all their lives and sancho something to
talk about for ages if he lived so long but don quixote coming close
to his ear said to him sancho as you would have us believe what you
saw in heaven i require you to believe me as to what i saw in the cave
of the counsels which don quixote gave sancho panza before he set out to
govern the island together with other well considered matters
the duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll
result of the adventure of the distressed one that they resolved to
carry on the joke seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for
making it all pass for reality so having laid their plans and given
instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to sancho in his
government of the promised island the next day that following
clavilenos flight the duke told sancho to prepare and get ready to go
and be governor for his islanders were already looking out for him as
sancho made him an obeisance and said ever since i came down from
heaven and from the top of it beheld the earth and saw how little it
is the great desire i had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me
for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed or
what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as
hazel nuts for so far as i could see there were no more on the whole
earth if your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a
bit of heaven were it no more than half a league id rather have it
recollect sancho said the duke i cannot give a bit of heaven no
not so much as the breadth of my nail to anyone rewards and favours of
that sort are reserved for god alone what i can give i give you and
that is a real genuine island compact well proportioned and
uncommonly fertile and fruitful where if you know how to use your
opportunities you may with the help of the worlds riches gain those
well then said sancho let the island come and ill try and be such
a governor that in spite of scoundrels ill go to heaven and its not
from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself but
from the desire i have to try what it tastes like to be a governor
if you once make trial of it sancho said the duke youll eat your
fingers off after the government so sweet a thing is it to command and
be obeyed depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor as he
will beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking it will be
no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him and he will be sore and
sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one
senor said sancho it is my belief its a good thing to be in
command if its only over a drove of cattle
may i be buried with you sancho said the duke but you know
everything i hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity
promises and that is all i have to say and now remember to morrow is
the day you must set out for the government of the island and this
evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear and
let them dress me as they like said sancho however im dressed ill
thats true said the duke but ones dress must be suited to the
office or rank one holds for it would not do for a jurist to dress like
a soldier or a soldier like a priest you sancho shall go partly as a
lawyer partly as a captain for in the island i am giving you arms are
needed as much as letters and letters as much as arms
of letters i know but little said sancho for i dont even know the a
b c but it is enough for me to have the christus in my memory to be a
good governor as for arms ill handle those they give me till i drop
with so good a memory said the duke sancho cannot go wrong in
here don quixote joined them and learning what passed and how soon
sancho was to go to his government he with the dukes permission took
him by the hand and retired to his room with him for the purpose of
giving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office as
soon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him and
almost by force made sancho sit down beside him and in a quiet tone thus
addressed him i give infinite thanks to heaven friend sancho that
before i have met with any good luck fortune has come forward to meet
thee i who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense of
thy services find myself still waiting for advancement while thou
before the time and contrary to all reasonable expectation seest
thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires some will bribe beg
solicit rise early entreat persist without attaining the object of
their suit while another comes and without knowing why or wherefore
finds himself invested with the place or office so many have sued for
and here it is that the common saying there is good luck as well as bad
luck in suits applies thou who to my thinking art beyond all doubt
a dullard without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble
with the mere breath of knight errantry that has breathed upon thee
seest thyself without more ado governor of an island as though it were a
mere matter of course this i say sancho that thou attribute not the
favour thou hast received to thine own merits but give thanks to heaven
that disposes matters beneficently and secondly thanks to the great
power the profession of knight errantry contains in itself with a heart
then inclined to believe what i have said to thee attend my son to
thy cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to
direct and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou
art about to ingulf thyself for offices and great trusts are nothing
first of all my son thou must fear god for in the fear of him is
wisdom and being wise thou canst not err in aught
secondly thou must keep in view what thou art striving to know
thyself the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine if
thou knowest thyself it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like
the frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox if thou dost
the recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as
the ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly
thats the truth said sancho but that was when i was a boy
afterwards when i was something more of a man it was geese i kept not
pigs but to my thinking that has nothing to do with it for all who are
true said don quixote and for that reason those who are not of noble
origin should take care that the dignity of the office they hold he
accompanied by a gentle suavity which wisely managed will save them from
the sneers of malice that no station escapes
glory in thy humble birth sancho and be not ashamed of saying thou art
peasant born for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one will set
himself to put thee to the blush and pride thyself rather upon being one
of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner countless are they who born of mean
parentage have risen to the highest dignities pontifical and imperial
and of the truth of this i could give thee instances enough to weary
remember sancho if thou make virtue thy aim and take a pride in doing
virtuous actions thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have princely
and lordly ones for blood is an inheritance but virtue an acquisition
and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not possess
this being so if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to see
thee when thou art in thine island thou art not to repel or slight him
but on the contrary to welcome him entertain him and make much of him
for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven which is not pleased
that any should despise what it hath made and wilt comply with the laws
if thou carriest thy wife with thee and it is not well for those that
administer governments to be long without their wives teach and
instruct her and strive to smooth down her natural roughness for all
that may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorish
if perchance thou art left a widower a thing which may happen and in
virtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree choose not one
to serve thee for a hook or for a fishing rod or for the hood of thy
wont have it for verily i tell thee for all the judges wife
receives the husband will be held accountable at the general calling to
account where he will have repay in death fourfold items that in life
never go by arbitrary law which is so much favoured by ignorant men who
let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion but not
more justice than the pleadings of the rich
strive to lay bare the truth as well amid the promises and presents of
the rich man as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor
when equity may and should be brought into play press not the utmost
rigour of the law against the guilty for the reputation of the stern
judge stands not higher than that of the compassionate
if perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve let it be
not by the weight of a gift but by that of mercy
if it should happen thee to give judgment in the cause of one who is
thine enemy turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on the
let not thine own passion blind thee in another mans cause for the
errors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable or if
not only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of thy
if any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee turn away thine eyes
from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations and consider
deliberately the merits of her demand if thou wouldst not have thy
reason swept away by her weeping and thy rectitude by her sighs
abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed for the pain of
punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of thine
bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is but a
miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature and
so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing for
though the attributes of god are all equal to our eyes that of mercy is
if thou followest these precepts and rules sancho thy days will be
long thy fame eternal thy reward abundant thy felicity unutterable
thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst they and thy grandchildren
will bear titles thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men and
when life draws to a close death will come to thee in calm and ripe old
age and the light and loving hands of thy great grandchildren will close
what i have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the
adornment of thy mind listen now to those which tend to that of the
of the second set of counsels don quixote gave sancho panza
who hearing the foregoing discourse of don quixote would not have set
him down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of
purpose but as has been frequently observed in the course of this great
history he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry and in
discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassed
understanding so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to his
intellect and his intellect to his acts but in the case of these second
counsels that he gave sancho he showed himself to have a lively turn of
humour and displayed conspicuously his wisdom and also his folly
sancho listened to him with the deepest attention and endeavoured to fix
his counsels in his memory like one who meant to follow them and by
their means bring the full promise of his government to a happy issue
with regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and thy
house sancho the first charge i have to give thee is to be clean and
to cut thy nails not letting them grow as some do whose ignorance makes
them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands as if those
excrescences they neglect to cut were nails and not the talons of a
lizard catching kestrel a filthy and unnatural abuse
go not ungirt and loose sancho for disordered attire is a sign of an
unstable mind unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to be set
down to craft as was the common opinion in the case of julius caesar
ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth and if it will allow
thee to give liveries to thy servants give them respectable and
serviceable rather than showy and gay ones and divide them between thy
servants and the poor that is to say if thou canst clothe six pages
clothe three and three poor men and thus thou wilt have pages for heaven
and pages for earth the vainglorious never think of this new mode of
eat not garlic nor onions lest they find out thy boorish origin by the
smell walk slowly and speak deliberately but not in such a way as to
make it seem thou art listening to thyself for all affectation is bad
dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still for the health of the whole
body is forged in the workshop of the stomach
be temperate in drinking bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps
take care sancho not to chew on both sides and not to eruct in
eruct said sancho i dont know what that means
to eruct sancho said don quixote means to belch and that is one of
the filthiest words in the spanish language though a very expressive
one and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the latin and instead
of belch say eruct and instead of belches say eructations and if some
do not understand these terms it matters little for custom will bring
them into use in the course of time so that they will be readily
understood this is the way a language is enriched custom and the public
in truth senor said sancho one of the counsels and cautions i mean
to bear in mind shall be this not to belch for im constantly doing
eruct i shall say henceforth and i swear not to forget it said
likewise sancho said don quixote thou must not mingle such a
quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost for though proverbs
are short maxims thou dost drag them in so often by the head and
shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims
god alone can cure that said sancho for i have more proverbs in me
than a book and when i speak they come so thick together into my mouth
that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out thats why my
tongue lets fly the first that come though they may not be pat to the
purpose but ill take care henceforward to use such as befit the dignity
of my office for in a house where theres plenty supper is soon
cooked and he who binds does not wrangle and the bell ringers in a
safe berth and giving and keeping require brains
thats it sancho said don quixote pack tack string proverbs
together nobody is hindering thee my mother beats me and i go on with
my tricks i am bidding thee avoid proverbs and here in a second thou
hast shot out a whole litany of them which have as much to do with what
we are talking about as over the hills of ubeda mind sancho i do not
say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable but to pile up and
string together proverbs at random makes conversation dull and vulgar
when thou ridest on horseback do not go lolling with thy body on the
back of the saddle nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the
horses belly nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou wert on
dapple for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms of
be moderate in thy sleep for he who does not rise early does not get
the benefit of the day and remember sancho diligence is the mother of
good fortune and indolence its opposite never yet attained the object
the last counsel i will give thee now though it does not tend to bodily
improvement i would have thee carry carefully in thy memory for i
believe it will be no less useful to thee than those i have given thee
already and it is this never engage in a dispute about families at
least in the way of comparing them one with another for necessarily one
of those compared will be better than the other and thou wilt be hated
by the one thou hast disparaged and get nothing in any shape from the
thy attire shall be hose of full length a long jerkin and a cloak a
trifle longer loose breeches by no means for they are becoming neither
for the present sancho this is all that has occurred to me to advise
thee as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow
if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced
senor said sancho i see well enough that all these things your
worship has said to me are good holy and profitable but what use will
they be to me if i dont remember one of them to be sure that about not
letting my nails grow and marrying again if i have the chance will not
slip out of my head but all that other hash muddle and jumble i dont
and cant recollect any more of it than of last years clouds so it must
be given me in writing for though i cant either read or write ill
give it to my confessor to drive it into me and remind me of it whenever
ah sinner that i am said don quixote how bad it looks in governors
not to know how to read or write for let me tell thee sancho when a
man knows not how to read or is left handed it argues one of two
things either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowly parents
or that he himself was so incorrigible and ill conditioned that neither
good company nor good teaching could make any impression on him it is a
great defect that thou labourest under and therefore i would have thee
learn at any rate to sign thy name i can sign my name well enough
said sancho for when i was steward of the brotherhood in my village i
learned to make certain letters like the marks on bales of goods which
they told me made out my name besides i can pretend my right hand is
disabled and make some one else sign for me for theres a remedy for
everything except death and as i shall be in command and hold the
staff i can do as i like moreover he who has the alcalde for his
father  and ill be governor and thats higher than alcalde only come
and see let them make light of me and abuse me theyll come for wool
and go back shorn whom god loves his house is known to him the
silly sayings of the rich pass for saws in the world and as ill be
rich being a governor and at the same time generous as i mean to be
no fault will be seen in me only make yourself honey and the flies will
suck you as much as thou hast so much art thou worth as my
grandmother used to say and thou canst have no revenge of a man of
oh gods curse upon thee sancho here exclaimed don quixote sixty
thousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs for the last hour
thou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs of
torture on me with every one of them those proverbs will bring thee to
the gallows one day i promise thee thy subjects will take the
government from thee or there will be revolts among them tell me where
dost thou pick them up thou booby how dost thou apply them thou
blockhead for with me to utter one and make it apply properly i have
to sweat and labour as if i were digging
by god master mine said sancho your worship is making a fuss about
very little why the devil should you be vexed if i make use of what is
my own and i have got nothing else nor any other stock in trade except
proverbs and more proverbs and here are three just this instant come
into my head pat to the purpose and like pears in a basket but i wont
repeat them for sage silence is called sancho
that sancho thou art not said don quixote for not only art thou
not sage silence but thou art pestilent prate and perversity still i
would like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thy
memory for i have been turning over mine own and it is a good one and
what can be better said sancho than never put thy thumbs between
two back teeth and to get out of my house and what do you want with
my wife there is no answer and whether the pitcher hits the stove
or the stove the pitcher its a bad business for the pitcher all which
fit to a hair for no one should quarrel with his governor or him in
authority over him because he will come off the worst as he does who
puts his finger between two back and if they are not back teeth it makes
no difference so long as they are teeth and to whatever the governor
may say theres no answer any more than to get out of my house and
what do you want with my wife and then as for that about the stone
and the pitcher a blind man could see that so that he who sees the
mote in anothers eye had need to see the beam in his own that it be
not said of himself the dead woman was frightened at the one with her
throat cut and your worship knows well that the fool knows more in his
own house than the wise man in anothers
nay sancho said don quixote the fool knows nothing either in his
own house or in anybody elses for no wise structure of any sort can
stand on a foundation of folly but let us say no more about it sancho
for if thou governest badly thine will be the fault and mine the shame
but i comfort myself with having done my duty in advising thee as
earnestly and as wisely as i could and thus i am released from my
obligations and my promise god guide thee sancho and govern thee in
thy government and deliver me from the misgiving i have that thou wilt
turn the whole island upside down a thing i might easily prevent by
explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that fat
little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs and
senor said sancho if your worship thinks im not fit for this
government i give it up on the spot for the mere black of the nail of
my soul is dearer to me than my whole body and i can live just as well
simple sancho on bread and onions as governor on partridges and
capons and whats more while were asleep were all equal great and
small rich and poor but if your worship looks into it you will see it
was your worship alone that put me on to this business of governing for
i know no more about the government of islands than a buzzard and if
theres any reason to think that because of my being a governor the devil
will get hold of me id rather go sancho to heaven than governor to
by god sancho said don quixote for those last words thou hast
uttered alone i consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand
islands thou hast good natural instincts without which no knowledge is
worth anything commend thyself to god and try not to swerve in the
pursuit of thy main object i mean always make it thy aim and fixed
purpose to do right in all matters that come before thee for heaven
always helps good intentions and now let us go to dinner for i think my
how sancho panza was conducted to his government and of the strange
adventure that befell don quixote in the castle
it is stated they say in the true original of this history that when
cide hamete came to write this chapter his interpreter did not translate
it as he wrote it that is as a kind of complaint the moor made against
himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety
as this of don quixote for he found himself forced to speak perpetually
of him and sancho without venturing to indulge in digressions and
episodes more serious and more interesting he said too that to go on
mind hand pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject and
speaking through the mouths of a few characters was intolerable
drudgery the result of which was never equal to the authors labour and
that to avoid this he had in the first part availed himself of the device
of novels like the ill advised curiosity and the captive captain
which stand as it were apart from the story the others are given there
being incidents which occurred to don quixote himself and could not be
omitted he also thought he says that many engrossed by the interest
attaching to the exploits of don quixote would take none in the novels
and pass them over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance
and art of their composition which would be very manifest were they
published by themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of don
quixote or the simplicities of sancho therefore in this second part he
thought it best not to insert novels either separate or interwoven but
only episodes something like them arising out of the circumstances the
facts present and even these sparingly and with no more words than
suffice to make them plain and as he confines and restricts himself to
the narrow limits of the narrative though he has ability capacity and
brains enough to deal with the whole universe he requests that his
labours may not be despised and that credit be given him not alone for
what he writes but for what he has refrained from writing
and so he goes on with his story saying that the day don quixote gave
the counsels to sancho the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to
him in writing so that he might get some one to read them to him they
had scarcely however been given to him when he let them drop and they
fell into the hands of the duke who showed them to the duchess and they
were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of don quixote to carry
on the joke then the same evening they despatched sancho with a large
following to the village that was to serve him for an island it happened
that the person who had him in charge was a majordomo of the dukes a
man of great discretion and humour and there can be no humour without
discretion and the same who played the part of the countess trifaldi in
the comical way that has been already described and thus qualified and
instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with sancho he
carried out their scheme admirably now it came to pass that as soon as
sancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of
the trifaldi and turning to his master he said to him senor either
the devil will carry me off here on this spot righteous and believing
or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the
dukes here is the very face of the distressed one
don quixote regarded the majordomo attentively and having done so said
to sancho there is no reason why the devil should carry thee off
sancho either righteous or believing and what thou meanest by that i
know not the face of the distressed one is that of the majordomo but
for all that the majordomo is not the distressed one for his being so
would involve a mighty contradiction but this is not the time for going
into questions of the sort which would be involving ourselves in an
inextricable labyrinth believe me my friend we must pray earnestly to
our lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters
it is no joke senor said sancho for before this i heard him speak
and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the trifaldi was sounding in my
ears well ill hold my peace but ill take care to be on the look out
henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or do away with this
thou wilt do well sancho said don quixote and thou wilt let me know
all thou discoverest and all that befalls thee in thy government
sancho at last set out attended by a great number of people he was
dressed in the garb of a lawyer with a gaban of tawny watered camlet
over all and a montera cap of the same material and mounted a la gineta
upon a mule behind him in accordance with the dukes orders followed
dapple with brand new ass trappings and ornaments of silk and from time
to time sancho turned round to look at his ass so well pleased to have
him with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor of
germany on taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and
got his masters blessing which don quixote gave him with tears and he
let worthy sancho go in peace and good luck to him gentle reader and
look out for two bushels of laughter which the account of how he behaved
himself in office will give thee in the meantime turn thy attention to
what happened his master the same night and if thou dost not laugh
thereat at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin for don
quixotes adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with
it is recorded then that as soon as sancho had gone don quixote felt
his loneliness and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate
and take away the government from him he would have done so the duchess
observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy because she
said if it was for the loss of sancho there were squires duennas and
damsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction
the truth is senora replied don quixote that i do feel the loss of
sancho but that is not the main cause of my looking sad and of all the
offers your excellence makes me i accept only the good will with which
they are made and as to the remainder i entreat of your excellence to
permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber
indeed senor don quixote said the duchess that must not be four of
my damsels as beautiful as flowers shall wait upon you
to me said don quixote they will not be flowers but thorns to
pierce my heart they or anything like them shall as soon enter my
chamber as fly if your highness wishes to gratify me still further
though i deserve it not permit me to please myself and wait upon myself
in my own room for i place a barrier between my inclinations and my
virtue and i do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your
highness is disposed to display towards me and in short i will sleep
in my clothes sooner than allow anyone to undress me
say no more senor don quixote say no more said the duchess i
assure you i will give orders that not even a fly not to say a damsel
shall enter your room i am not the one to undermine the propriety of
senor don quixote for it strikes me that among his many virtues the one
that is pre eminent is that of modesty your worship may undress and
dress in private and in your own way as you please and when you please
for there will be no one to hinder you and in your chamber you will find
all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who sleeps with his
door locked to the end that no natural needs compel you to open it may
the great dulcinea del toboso live a thousand years and may her fame
extend all over the surface of the globe for she deserves to be loved by
a knight so valiant and so virtuous and may kind heaven infuse zeal into
the heart of our governor sancho panza to finish off his discipline
speedily so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a
to which don quixote replied your highness has spoken like what you
are from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come and dulcinea
will be more fortunate and better known to the world by the praise of
your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth
well well senor don quixote said the duchess is nearly supper time
and the duke is is probably waiting come let us go to supper and retire
to rest early for the journey you made yesterday from kandy was not such
a short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue
i feel none senora said don quixote for i would go so far as to
swear to your excellence that in all my life i never mounted a quieter
beast or a pleasanter paced one than clavileno and i dont know what
could have induced malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle
and burn it so recklessly as he did
probably said the duchess repenting of the evil he had done to the
trifaldi and company and others and the crimes he must have committed
as a wizard and enchanter he resolved to make away with all the
instruments of his craft and so burned clavileno as the chief one and
that which mainly kept him restless wandering from land to land and by
its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great don
quixote of la mancha is established for ever
don quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess and having supped retired
to his chamber alone refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait
on him such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead or
drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady dulcinea for he had
always present to his mind the virtue of amadis that flower and mirror
of knights errant he locked the door behind him and by the light of two
wax candles undressed himself but as he was taking off his stockings o
disaster unworthy of such a personage there came a burst not of sighs
or anything belying his delicacy or good breeding but of some two dozen
stitches in one of his stockings that made it look like a
window lattice the worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed and
at that moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a
drachm of green silk there i say green silk because the stockings were
here cide hamete exclaimed as he was writing o poverty poverty i know
not what could have possessed the great cordovan poet to call thee holy
gift ungratefully received although a moor i know well enough from the
intercourse i have had with christians that holiness consists in charity
humility faith obedience and poverty but for all that i say he must
have a great deal of godliness who can find any satisfaction in being
poor unless indeed it be the kind of poverty one of their greatest
saints refers to saying possess all things as though ye possessed them
not which is what they call poverty in spirit but thou that other
poverty for it is of thee i am speaking now why dost thou love to fall
out with gentlemen and men of good birth more than with other people why
dost thou compel them to smear the cracks in their shoes and to have the
buttons of their coats one silk another hair and another glass why
must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves and not crimped
with a crimping iron from this we may perceive the antiquity of starch
and crimped ruffs then he goes on poor gentleman of good family
always cockering up his honour dining miserably and in secret and
making a hypocrite of the toothpick with which he sallies out into the
street after eating nothing to oblige him to use it poor fellow i say
with his nervous honour fancying they perceive a league off the patch on
his shoe the sweat stains on his hat the shabbiness of his cloak and
all this was brought home to don quixote by the bursting of his stitches
however he comforted himself on perceiving that sancho had left behind a
pair of travelling boots which he resolved to wear the next day at last
he went to bed out of spirits and heavy at heart as much because he
missed sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings
the stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another
colour which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can
show in the course of his never failing embarrassments he put out the
candles but the night was warm and he could not sleep he rose from his
bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful
garden and as he did so he perceived and heard people walking and
talking in the garden he set himself to listen attentively and those
below raised their voices so that he could hear these words
urge me not to sing emerencia for thou knowest that ever since this
stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him i cannot sing but
only weep besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper and i
would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here and
even if she were asleep and did not waken my singing would be in vain
if this strange aeneas who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me
sleeps on and wakens not to hear it
heed not that dear altisidora replied a voice the duchess is no
doubt asleep and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and
disturber of thy soul for just now i perceived him open the grated
window of his chamber so he must be awake sing my poor sufferer in a
low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp and even if the duchess
hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night
that is not the point emerencia replied altisidora it is that i
would not that my singing should lay bare my heart and that i should be
thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power
of love but come what may better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in
the heart and here a harp softly touched made itself heard as he
listened to all this don quixote was in a state of breathless amazement
for immediately the countless adventures like this with windows
gratings gardens serenades lovemakings and languishings that he had
read of in his trashy books of chivalry came to his mind he at once
concluded that some damsel of the duchesss was in love with him and
that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret he trembled lest
he should fall and made an inward resolution not to yield and
commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady dulcinea he
made up his mind to listen to the music and to let them know he was
there he gave a pretended sneeze at which the damsels were not a little
delighted for all they wanted was that don quixote should hear them so
having tuned the harp altisidora running her hand across the strings
for those two suns of thine have lit
fain would i change with her and give
and i would give thee pearls that should
here the lay of the heart stricken altisidora came to an end while the
warmly wooed don quixote began to feel alarm and with a deep sigh he
said to himself o that i should be such an unlucky knight that no
damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me o that the peerless
dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my
incomparable constancy in peace what would ye with her ye queens why
do ye persecute her ye empresses why ye pursue her ye virgins of from
fourteen to fifteen leave the unhappy being to triumph rejoice and
glory in the lot love has been pleased to bestow upon her in surrendering
my heart and yielding up my soul to her ye love smitten host know that
to dulcinea only i am dough and sugar paste flint to all others for her
i am honey for you aloes for me dulcinea alone is beautiful wise
virtuous graceful and high bred and all others are ill favoured
foolish light and low born nature sent me into the world to be hers
and no others altisidora may weep or sing the lady for whose sake they
belaboured me in the castle of the enchanted moor may give way to
despair but i must be dulcineas boiled or roast pure courteous and
chaste in spite of all the magic working powers on earth and with that
he shut the window with a bang and as much out of temper and out of
sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him stretched himself on
his bed where we will leave him for the present as the great sancho
panza who is about to set up his famous government now demands our
of how the great sancho panza took possession of his island and of how
o perpetual discoverer of the antipodes torch of the world eye of
heaven sweet stimulator of the water coolers thimbraeus here phoebus
there now archer now physician father of poetry inventor of music
thou that always risest and notwithstanding appearances never settest
to thee o sun by whose aid man begetteth man to thee i appeal to help
me and lighten the darkness of my wit that i may be able to proceed with
scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great sancho panzas
government for without thee i feel myself weak feeble and uncertain
to come to the point then sancho with all his attendants arrived at a
village of some thousand inhabitants and one of the largest the duke
possessed they informed him that it was called the island of barataria
either because the name of the village was baratario or because of the
joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him on
reaching the gates of the town which was a walled one the municipality
came forth to meet him the bells rang out a peal and the inhabitants
showed every sign of general satisfaction and with great pomp they
conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to god and then
with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town
and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of barataria
the costume the beard and the fat squat figure of the new governor
astonished all those who were not in the secret and even all who were
and they were not a few finally leading him out of the church they
carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it and the dukes
majordomo said to him it is an ancient custom in this island senor
governor that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is
bound to answer a question which shall be put to him and which must be a
somewhat knotty and difficult one and by his answer the people take the
measure of their new governors wit and hail with joy or deplore his
while the majordomo was making this speech sancho was gazing at several
large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat and as he could
not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall the answer
was senor there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship
took possession of this island and the inscription says this day the
so and so of such and such a month and year senor don sancho panza took
possession of this island many years may he enjoy it
and whom do they call don sancho panza asked sancho
your lordship replied the majordomo for no other panza but the one
who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island
well then let me tell you brother said sancho i havent got the
don nor has any one of my family ever had it my name is plain sancho
panza and sancho was my fathers name and sancho was my grandfathers
and they were all panzas without any dons or donas tacked on i suspect
that in this island there are more dons than stones but never mind god
knows what i mean and maybe if my government lasts four days ill weed
out these dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges
theyre so plenty let the majordomo go on with his question and ill
give the best answer i can whether the people deplore or not
at this instant there came into court two old men one carrying a cane by
way of a walking stick and the one who had no stick said senor some
time ago i lent this good man ten gold crowns in gold to gratify him and
