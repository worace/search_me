the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
direction of the drum as formerly but made them on the contrary run
farther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
to be seen in gray coats with closely shaven heads two officers one
with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean dark gray horse
the other in an overcoat and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinka
street talking a third officer galloped up to them
the general orders them all to be driven out at once without fail
this is outrageous half the men have dispersed
where are you off to where he shouted to three infantrymen
without muskets who holding up the skirts of their overcoats were
slipping past him into the bazaar passage stop you rascals
but how are you going to stop them replied another officer there is
no getting them together the army should push on before the rest bolt
how can one push on they are stuck there wedged on the bridge and
dont move shouldnt we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from
come go in there and drive them out shouted the senior officer
the officer in the scarf dismounted called up a drummer and went with
him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group a
shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose and a calm
persistent calculating expression on his plump face hurriedly and
your honor said he be so good as to protect us we wont grudge
trifles you are welcome to anything we shall be delighted pray
ill fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman or
even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is but whats all
this sheer robbery if you please could not guards be placed if only
eh what twaddle said one of them a thin stern looking man when
ones head is gone one doesnt weep for ones hair take what any of you
like and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
its all very well for you ivan sidorych to talk said the first
talk indeed cried the thin one in my three shops here i have a
hundred thousand rubles worth of goods can they be saved when the army
has gone eh what people against gods might our hands cant fight
come inside your honor repeated the tradesman bowing
the officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision
its not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one of
from one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation and just as
the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was
this man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer the
officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops but at that
moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva
bridge and the officer ran out into the square
what is it what is it he asked but his comrade was already
galloping off past vasili the beatified in the direction from which the
the officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached the
bridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridge
several overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among the
troops beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
harnessed four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels
the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a childs chair
with its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and
desperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screams
of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge
had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
bridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shouting
and squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troops
meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the
streets the gates and shops were all closed only here and there round
the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobody
drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard the
povarskaya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of the
rostovs house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
horses and not a soul was to be seen there in the great drawing room
of the house which had been left with all it contained were two
people they were the yard porter ignat and the page boy mishka
vasilichs grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather
mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one
finger the yard porter his arms akimbo stood smiling with
isnt it fine eh uncle ignat said the boy suddenly beginning to
only fancy answered ignat surprised at the broadening grin on his
impudence impudence they heard behind them the voice of mavra
kuzminichna who had entered silently how hes grinning the fat mug
is that what youre here for nothings cleared away down there and
vasilich is worn out just you wait a bit
ignat left off smiling adjusted his belt and went out of the room with
aunt i did it gently said the boy
ill give you something gently you monkey you cried mavra
kuzminichna raising her arm threateningly go and get the samovar to
mavra kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it and
with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door
going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next
to drink tea in the servants wing with vasilich or into the storeroom
she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street someone
stopped at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it
an officer i have to see him came the reply in a pleasant well bred
mavra kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen with the
round face of a rostov entered the yard
they have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime said
the young officer standing in the gateway as if hesitating whether to
ah how annoying he muttered i should have come yesterday ah
examining the familiar rostov features of the young mans face his
what did you want to see the count for she asked
oh well it cant be helped said he in a tone of vexation and
placed his hand on the gate as if to leave
you see he suddenly said i am a kinsman of the counts and he has
been very kind to me as you see he glanced with an amused air and
good natured smile at his coat and boots my things are worn out and i
have no money so i was going to ask the count
just wait a minute sir one little moment said she
and as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and
hurrying away on her old legs went through the back yard to the
while mavra kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about
the yard gazing at his worn out boots with lowered head and a faint
smile on his lips what a pity ive missed uncle what a nice old
woman where has she run off to and how am i to find the nearest way to
overtake my regiment which must by now be getting near the rogozhski
gate thought he just then mavra kuzminichna appeared from behind the
corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying a
rolled up check kerchief in her hand while still a few steps from the
officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty
five ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him
if his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of course
mavra kuzminichna grew abashed and confused the officer did not
decline but took the note quietly and thanked her
if the count had been at home mavra kuzminichna went on
apologetically christ be with you sir may god preserve you said
swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer ran
almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yauza bridge to
but mavra kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist
eyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of
motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer
from an unfinished house on the varvarka the ground floor of which was
a dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tables
in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiring
with dim eyes and wide open mouths they were all laboriously singing
some song or other they were singing discordantly arduously and with
great effort evidently not because they wished to sing but because
they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree one a tall fair
haired lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the others his face
with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for
his thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes
evidently possessed by some idea he stood over those who were singing
and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with
the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out his
dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always
carefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were most
important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare
in the midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in the
passage and porch the tall lad waved his arm
stop it he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads and
still rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porch
the factory hands followed him these men who under the leadership of
the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning had brought the
publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served
them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds of
revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wished
to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted
the publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the
workmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavern
another smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publican
the lad with the turned up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
at that moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised face
to make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice police murder
oh gracious me a man beaten to death killed screamed a woman
havent you robbed people enough taking their last shirts said a
voice addressing the publican what have you killed a man for you
the tall lad standing in the porch turned his bleared eyes from the
publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to
murderer he shouted suddenly to the publican bind him lads
i daresay you would like to bind me shouted the publican pushing
away the men advancing on him and snatching his cap from his head he
as if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance the
i know the law very well mates ill take the matter to the captain of
police you think i wont get to him robbery is not permitted to
anybody now a days shouted the publican picking up his cap
come along then come along then the publican and the tall young
fellow repeated one after the other and they moved up the street
the bloodstained smith went beside them the factory hands and others
at the corner of the moroseyka opposite a large house with closed
shutters and bearing a bootmakers signboard stood a score of thin
worn out gloomy faced bootmakers wearing overalls and long tattered
he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowning
but hes sucked our blood and now he thinks hes quit of us hes been
misleading us all the week and now that hes brought us to this pass
on seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
speaking and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
i say is it true that we have been beaten and what did you think
questions and answers were heard the publican taking advantage of the
increased crowd dropped behind and returned to his tavern
the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe waved his
bare arm and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention
to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting
answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds
he must keep order keep the law thats what the government is there
for am i not right good christians said the tall youth with a
scarcely perceptible smile he thinks theres no government how can
one do without government or else there would be plenty whod rob us
why talk nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd will they give up
moscow like this they told you that for fun and you believed it
arent there plenty of troops on the march let him in indeed thats
what the government is for youd better listen to what people are
saying said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth
by the wall of china town a smaller group of people were gathered round
a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand
an ukase they are reading an ukase reading an ukase cried voices in
the crowd and the people rushed toward the reader
the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august 31 when
the crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand of
the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a rather
tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning
early tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness he read sirin
highness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
a frown on his brow to consult with him to act and to aid the army
to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the reader
went on and then paused do you see shouted the youth victoriously
hes going to clear up the whole affair for you in destroying
them and will send these visitors to the devil i will come back to
dinner and well set to work we will do completely do and undo these
the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence the tall
lad hung his head gloomily it was evident that no one had understood
the last part in particular the words i will come back to dinner
evidently displeased both reader and audience the peoples minds were
tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
comprehensible it was what any one of them might have said and
therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should
they all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his lips and
we should ask him thats he himself yes ask him indeed
why not hell explain voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly
heard saying and the general attention turned to the police
superintendents trap which drove into the square attended by two
the superintendent of police who had gone that morning by count
rostopchins orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
pocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
what people are these he shouted to the men who were moving singly
and timidly in the direction of his trap
what people are these he shouted again receiving no answer
your honor replied the shopman in the frieze coat your honor in
accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count they
desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any kind of
the count has not left he is here and an order will be issued
concerning you said the superintendent of police go on he ordered
the crowd halted pressing around those who had heard what the
superintendent had said and looking at the departing trap
the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared
look said something to his coachman and his horses increased their
its a fraud lads lead the way to him himself shouted the tall
youth dont let him go lads let him answer us keep him shouted
different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap
following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went
there now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
perish do they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard saying
on the evening of the first of september after his interview with
kutuzov count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended
because he had not been invited to attend the council of war and
because kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the
defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at
the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its
patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this
rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa
without undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
bringing him a letter from kutuzov this letter requested the count to
send police officers to guide the troops through the town as the army
was retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow this was not news to
rostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since
his interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but
ever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who came to
moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to
fight another battle and since then the government property had been
removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with
rostopchins own permission yet all the same this information
astonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of a
simple note with an order from kutuzov and received at night breaking
when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions at
this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important
considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the
departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all
rostopchins actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics
the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why
were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would
not be given up and thereby ruined to preserve the tranquillity of
the city explains count rostopchin why were bundles of useless
papers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and other
articles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchin
one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
on what then was count rostopchins fear for the tranquillity of
moscow based in 1812 what reason was there for assuming any probability
of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the
retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses to
neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an
insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten
thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of
september and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled
there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would
have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if
after the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow became
certain or at least probable rostopchin instead of exciting the people
by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the
holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the
population plainly that the town would be abandoned
rostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and
impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be
guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he had in
imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of
the heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all
administrators that he controlled the external actions of moscows
inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by
means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which the
people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
authority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of
relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display
took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
his feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knew
it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe
that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the
inhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices were
removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count
yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for
himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he
knew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and
did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs
all his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful and
had any effect on the people is another question had been simply
directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing
hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even
possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when self
confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
moscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one man
abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the
depth of their national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchin
suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous
weak and alone with no ground to stand on
when awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory note
from kutuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to
blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state
property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was no
longer possible to take the whole of it away
who is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he
ruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscow
firmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villains
traitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains and
traitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
all that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came to
him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the count
your excellency the director of the registrars department has sent
for instructions from the consistory from the senate from the
university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent
asking for information what are your orders about the fire brigade
from the governor of the prison from the superintendent of the
lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually
to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
orders from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefully
prepared by him had now been ruined by somebody and that that somebody
would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen
oh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the
registrars department that he should remain to guard his documents
now why are you asking silly questions about the fire brigade they have
horses let them be off to vladimir and not leave them to the french
your excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come
my commands let them go away thats all and let the lunatics out
into the town when lunatics command our armies god evidently means
in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison count
do you expect me to give you two battalions which we have not got for
a convoy release them thats all about it
your excellency there are some political prisoners meshkov
vereshchagin hasnt he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bring
toward nine oclock in the morning when the troops were already moving
through moscow nobody came to the count any more for instructions
those who were able to get away were going of their own accord those
who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do
the count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki and sat
in his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn
in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is
only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept
going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while the
sea of history remains calm the ruler administrator in his frail bark
holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the
ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship moves
independently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longer
reaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of
appearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificant
rostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated him
the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to see
him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
horses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of
police after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had
received informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the
without saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light
luxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took hold of the
handle let it go again and went to the window from which he had a
better view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in front
flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the blood
stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices was
is my carriage ready asked rostopchin stepping back from the window
but what do they want he asked the superintendent of police
your excellency they say they have got ready according to your
orders to go against the french and they shouted something about
treachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellency i hardly
managed to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggest
you may go i dont need you to tell me what to do exclaimed
he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd
this is what they have done with russia this is what they have done
with me thought he full of an irrepressible fury that welled up
within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by
anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is that
mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd
this rabble they have roused by their folly they want a victim he
thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm and this
thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim
yes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he is
ah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollection
and rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony
the talking instantly ceased hats and caps were doffed and all eyes
good morning lads said the count briskly and loudly thank you for
coming ill come out to you in a moment but we must first settle with
the villain we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
and the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd hell
settle with all the villains youll see and you said the french
hell show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one
a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door
gave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved
eagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out there
with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someone
where is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man coming
round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long thin
neck and his head that had been half shaved was again covered by
short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
lined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict
trousers over which were pulled his thin dirty trodden down boots on
his thin weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
ah said rostopchin hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young
man in the fur lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch
the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
indicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his
neck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed and
submissively folded before him his thin hands unused to work
for several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
the silence continued only among the back rows of the people who were
all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling
while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchin
stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand
lads said he with a metallic ring in his voice this man
vereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing
the young man in the fur lined coat stooping a little stood in a
submissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated young
face disfigured by the half shaven head hung down hopelessly at the
counts first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye but rostopchin did
not look at him a vein in the young mans long thin neck swelled like a
cord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face flushed
all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more
hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly
and timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step
he has betrayed his tsar and his country he has gone over to
bonaparte he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian name
he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even voice
but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand in
the same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised his
deal with him as you think fit i hand him over to you
the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one
another to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling
atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown
uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing in
front who had seen and heard what had taken place before them all
stood with wide open eyes and mouths straining with all their strength
and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them
beat him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name
shouted rostopchin cut him down i command it
hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins voice
the crowd moaned and heaved forward but again paused
count exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in the
midst of the momentary silence that ensued count one god is above us
both he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck
filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face
he did not finish what he wished to say
cut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growing
draw sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his own
another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tall
youth with a stony look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stood
and one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with fury
struck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber
ah cried vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with a
frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him a
similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd o lord
but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin
he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrier
of human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd in
check suddenly broke the crime had begun and must now be completed the
plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
of the crowd like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship that
last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks
carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon was
about to repeat his blow vereshchagin with a cry of horror covering
his head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youth
against whom he stumbled seized his thin neck with his hands and
yelling wildly fell with him under the feet of the pressing struggling
some beat and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and the
screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a long
time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beaten
almost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste with
which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun those who were
hitting throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill
him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with them
in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
hit him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold christ
still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief
only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long
drawn measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate
bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places each one came up
glanced at what had been done and with horror reproach and
o lord the people are like wild beasts how could he be alive voices
in the crowd could be heard saying quite a young fellow too must
have been a merchants son what men and they say hes not the right
one how not the right one o lord and theres another has been
beaten too they say hes nearly done for oh the people arent
they afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with pained
distress at the dead body with its long thin half severed neck and its
a painstaking police officer considering the presence of a corpse in
his excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away
two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the
ground the gory dust stained half shaven head with its long neck
trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank back from it
at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage
yells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly turned pale and instead
of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went with
hurried steps and bent head not knowing where and why along the
passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the counts face was
white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw
this way your excellency where are you going this way
please said a trembling frightened voice behind him
count rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went in
the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche the
distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily
took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
when they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the
shouts of the mob the count began to repent he remembered with
dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
subordinates the mob is terrible disgusting he said to himself in
french they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease
count one god is above us both vereshchagins words suddenly
recurred to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this
was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully at
himself i had other duties thought he the people had to be
appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
public good and he began thinking of his social duties to his family
and to the city entrusted to him and of himself not himself as
theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevich
rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself as
governor the representative of authority and of the tsar had i been
simply theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite
different but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as
lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grew physically
calm and as always happens as soon as he became physically tranquil
his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the
thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since the
world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this
same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare of
to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who
commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and
not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but he
even found cause for self satisfaction in having so successfully
contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
criminal and at the same time pacify the mob
vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchin
though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor he
was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i have
killed two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim
and at the same time punished a miscreant
having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic
half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
sokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering
what was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard
that kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and
stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception he
would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all
the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
ruin of russia as rostopchin regarded it would fall upon his doting
old head planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov rostopchin
turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side
the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the
almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white and
others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
one of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchins
carriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked
with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
swaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his fluttering
dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on
rostopchin shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him
to stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its
beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffron
yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids
stop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again
shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures
coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it
thrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they
stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise
they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice
will i overthrow it and thrice re establish it he cried raising his
count rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed
in on vereshchagin he turned away go fas faster he cried in a
trembling voice to his coachman the caleche flew over the ground as
fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchin
still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened
bloodstained face of the traitor in the fur lined coat
recent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it had
cut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that
the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but that
the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever more
cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hear
the sound of his own words cut him down i command it
why did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i
need not have said them he thought and then nothing would have
happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
who dealt the blow the look of silent timid reproach that boy in the
fur lined coat had turned upon him but i did not do it for my own
sake i was bound to act that way the mob the traitor the public
troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was hot kutuzov
dejected and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip
in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a generals
uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said something in
french it was count rostopchin he told kutuzov that he had come
because moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained
things would have been different if your serene highness had not told
me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all this
kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to him
he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
face of the man addressing him rostopchin grew confused and became
silent kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
no i shall not give up moscow without a battle
whether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he
spoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be
meaningless at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him
and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchin
took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
to drive on the carts that blocked the way
toward four oclock in the afternoon murats troops were entering
moscow in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behind
them rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite
about the middle of the arbat street near the church of the miraculous
icon of st nicholas murat halted to await news from the advanced
detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel le
around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow they
all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange long haired commander
is that their tsar himself hes not bad low voices could be heard
take off your cap your caps these words went from one to another
in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it
was far to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to the
unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
speaking russian did not understand what was being said to him and
murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian
army was one of the russians understood what was asked and several
voices at once began answering the interpreter a french officer
returning from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reported
that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
