not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an
uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a
miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their
actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i
am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own
and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely
perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real
superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it
no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough
but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch
for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the
convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper
would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost
that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment
is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i
really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome
and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand
do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a
conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my
her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was
opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for
it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which
would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at
least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them
very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively
resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the
contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long
she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned and the request made
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss
bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most
conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost
all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most
tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really
glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the
evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of
its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information
for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it
had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at
breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners
are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger
mrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr
bingley i am sure well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr
bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be
got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago
i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring
early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned
pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago
jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail they
had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which
mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false
friends why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the
misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but
for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance there mrs
bennet my mind however is now made up on the subject for having
received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de
bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the
offered olive branch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for
it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to
receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight
following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i
remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman
said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if
he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his
elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him
out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he
would help it if he could could he be a sensible man sir
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his
letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem
defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for
their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her ill will
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great
politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the
ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a
tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and
stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage this
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs
bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily
you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you
must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things
i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and
could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each
other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the
hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised
and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets
heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing but he was set right there by mrs bennet who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he
begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants
were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady
catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for
his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen
better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings
and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself some shelves in the closet up stairs
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and
i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her does she live near you sir
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family
she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very
ah said mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than
many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still
resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town
and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the
british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most
elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by
her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment or are the result of previous study
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible
mr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner
by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily
assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and
begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at
him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some
deliberation he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the
volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three
do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away
richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me
so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more
about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr
collins much offended laid aside his book and said
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes
me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in
retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which
he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness
mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a
clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of
having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their fathers
estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and
suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennets lovely face
confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled
choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a
quarter of an hours tete a tete with mrs bennet before breakfast a
conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at
longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could
not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her
eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her
to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon
done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally
next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course
mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister
except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them
at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him
and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed
him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his
cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom
they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking
with another officer on the other side of the way the officer was
the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came
to inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the
strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia
determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had
reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated
permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with
him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of
beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy
and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the
ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and
began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and
miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to
longbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated
it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting
both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham
after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just
deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to
imagine it was impossible not to long to know
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what
passed took leave and rode on with his friend
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias
pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of
mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest
from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as
their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing
about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the
street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility
was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she
received him with her very best politeness which he returned with
as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous
acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself
however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom
however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that
mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a
lieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him the
last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid
disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipses
the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such
delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either
or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring
mrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although
utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be
attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their
aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room
that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification but when mrs phillips understood from him what
rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherines drawing rooms and found
that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all
the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and
the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive
listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the
interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking
of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and
walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle phillips
breathing port wine who followed them into the room
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel
that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the
officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin when the card tables were placed he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad
to improve myself for in my situation in life  mrs phillips was very
glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there
seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets
she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear
him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not
even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in
a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject
drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i
yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear
ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for
i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after
seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly i have
spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being
agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me
to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else here you are in your own family
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in
the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short
interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his
high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an
ill tempered man wickham only shook his head
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer
i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms
and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for
avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense
of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he
is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men
that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never
be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with
all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the
neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added
which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be
a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them
society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and
my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have
now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i
was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we
yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me
i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply
and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given
good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his
will be disregarded why did you not seek legal redress
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain
it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was
of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no
less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and
i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can
recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort
this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i
can forget his father i can never defy or expose him
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can
a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me
less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon
attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked
him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do
remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of
his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to
treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his
father she could have added a young man too like you whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself
with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood
connected together as i think you said in the closest manner
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest
part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house
sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my
father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips
appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most
intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence
and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself
how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better
motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we are
none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money
freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the
poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what
his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family
to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the
pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride
which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers
he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to
speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very
proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond
of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is
nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen
and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her
home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first and saying
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley
who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable
be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not
want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his
pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just
sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round
the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs phillips the usual inquiries as to his success was
made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every
point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chances of these things and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for
a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him
a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her
notice but he certainly has not known her long
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherines
connections i never heard of her existence till the day before
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss
bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship
i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have
not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked
her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from
her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her
nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr
wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise
of mrs phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to
everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done
gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could
think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all
the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and
mrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr
wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the
possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be
done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way
or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of
laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such
a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is
impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his
character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it
be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his
it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to
