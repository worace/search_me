manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening

of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as
if in it lay the gist of the matter
then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto
 and the wish which constitutes the emperors sole and absolute aim
to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has now decided him
to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for
zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine
with dignity and looking to the count for approval
connaissez vous le proverbe  jerome jerome do not roam but turn
spindles at home said shinshin puckering his brows and smiling
cela nous convient a merveille2 suvorov now he knew what he was
about yet they beat him a plate couture3 and where are we to find
suvorovs now je vous demande un peu4 said he continually changing
2 that suits us down to the ground
ve must vight to the last tr r op of our plood said the colonel
thumping the table and ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill
pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as po o ossible he dwelt
particularly on the word possible as po o ossible he ended again
turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it and zeres
an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you
judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the
war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears
i am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his
plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and
desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger
i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concluded
conscious as were others after the words were uttered that his remarks
were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore
what you said just now was splendid said his partner julie
sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down
to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking
pierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvingly
the young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the
what are you making such a noise about over there marya dmitrievnas
deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table what are
you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are
you exciting yourself do you think the french are here
i am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile
its all about the war the count shouted down the table you know my
sons going marya dmitrievna my son is going
i have four sons in the army but still i dont fret it is all in gods
hands you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle
replied marya dmitrievnas deep voice which easily carried the whole
once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and
you wont ask natashas little brother was saying i know you wont
her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half
rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what
mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice
what is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her daughters
face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a
mamma what sweets are we going to have and natashas voice sounded
the countess tried to frown but could not marya dmitrievna shook her
most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the
you had better take care said the countess
mamma what sweets are we going to have natasha again cried boldly
with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part
sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter
you see i have asked whispered natasha to her little brother and to
ice pudding but you wont get any said marya dmitrievna
natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
marya dmitrievna what kind of ice pudding i dont like ice cream
no what kind marya dmitrievna what kind she almost screamed i
marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests
joined in everyone laughed not at marya dmitrievnas answer but at the
incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to
natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the band
again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving
their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across
the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with
one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the
same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests
returned to the drawing room and to the counts study
the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the counts
visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the
the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from
dropping into his usual after dinner nap and laughed at everything the
young people at the countess instigation gathered round the
clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she
had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the
other young ladies in begging natasha and nicholas who were noted for
their musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated as
though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the
well then lets be quick boris come here said natasha but where
she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
running into sonyas room and not finding her there natasha ran to the
nursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded that she must
be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the place
of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household
and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on nurses dirty feather
bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her
hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively
that her bare little shoulders shook natashas face which had been so
radiantly happy all that saints day suddenly changed her eyes became
fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of
sonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and
natashas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began
to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya was crying
sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face
still deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on the blue striped
feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonya sat up and
nicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have come
he told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed a
paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had written
still i should not cry but you cant no one can understand what
and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul
its all very well for you i am not envious i love you and boris
also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are
no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin one would
have to the metropolitan himself and even then it cant be done
and besides if she tells mamma sonya looked upon the countess as her
mother and called her so that i am spoiling nicholas career and am
heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my witness and she
made the sign of the cross i love her so much and all of you only
vera and what for what have i done to her i am so grateful to you
that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing
sonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the
feather bed natasha began consoling her but her face showed that she
understood all the gravity of her friends trouble
sonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason
of her friends sorrow im sure vera has said something to you since
yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others and
she found them on my table and said shed show them to mamma and that i
was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry me but
that hell marry julie you see how hes been with her all day
natasha what have i done to deserve it
and again she began to sob more bitterly than before natasha lifted
her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting
sonya dont believe her darling dont believe her do you remember
how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after
supper why we settled how everything was to be i dont quite remember
how but dont you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice
it all was theres uncle shinshins brother has married his first
cousin and we are only second cousins you know and boris says it is
quite possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so
clever and so good said natasha dont you cry sonya dear love
darling sonya and she kissed her and laughed veras spiteful never
mind her and all will come right and she wont say anything to mamma
nicholas will tell her himself and he doesnt care at all for julie
sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it
seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should
do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her
really truly answered natasha pushing in a crisp lock that had
do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said
and she set off at a run along the passage
sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran
after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang
the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then
nicholas sang a song he had just learned
at nighttime in the moons fair glow how sweet as fancies wander free
to feel that in this world theres one who still is thinking but of
that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music oer the lea
it is for thee thus swells her heart sighing its message out to thee
a day or two then bliss unspoilt but oh till then i cannot live
he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get
ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the
coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery
pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinshin had engaged him
as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in
which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began
natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and
mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers
i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be
my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender
while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up
pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy
she was dancing with a grown up man who had been abroad she was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown up lady
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold
assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where
she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and
dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed
well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at
in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had
been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older
visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and
replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came
marya dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count
with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to
marya dmitrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit
up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended
he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery
this was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his youth
strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise
look at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grown up partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter
and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner
marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his
shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a
smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay
strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the
other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry
just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the
nurse as she stood in one of the doorways
the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not
want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms
hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her
stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed
by the whole of the counts plump figure in marya dmitrievna found
expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose
but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed
the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the
agility with which he capered about on his light feet marya dmitrievna
produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to
move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot
which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity
the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not
attract a moments attention to their own evolutions and did not even
try to do so all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna natasha
kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa
though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the
intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to
the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more
lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round marya
dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his
partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft
foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide
sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by
natasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their
thats how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count
that was a daniel cooper exclaimed marya dmitrievna tucking up her
while in the rostovs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a
tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and
cooks were getting the supper count bezukhov had a sixth stroke the
doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute confession
communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the
sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill
of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond the gates
a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in
expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral the military
governor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending aides de camp to
inquire after the counts health came himself that evening to bid a
last farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherines court count
the magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood up
respectfully when the military governor having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince
vasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days
escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in
when the military governor had gone prince vasili sat down all alone on
a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning
his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sitting
so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes
went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the
back of the house to the room of the eldest princess
those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mans
room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
the limits of human life are fixed and may not be oerpassed said
an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
i wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady
adding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own
ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his
hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald
who was that the military governor himself was being asked at the
other side of the room how young looking he is
yes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unction
i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times
the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a
graceful pose under a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a
beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather
the weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow one feels as
yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh so he may have
take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and
he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch
dere has neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an aide de
camp dat one liffs after de sird stroke
and what a well preserved man he was remarked the aide de camp and
who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper
it vont go begging replied the german with a smile
everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second
princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to lorrains
instructions the german doctor went up to lorrain
do you think he can last till morning asked the german addressing
lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before
tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a
decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to understand
meanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess room
in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles
the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots
cupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed was
just visible behind a screen a small dog began to bark
she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth
that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
has anything happened she asked i am so terrified
no there is no change i only came to have a talk about business
catiche  muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair
she had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say he
remarked well sit down lets have a talk
i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging
stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she
i wished to get a nap mon cousin but i cant
well my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and bending it
it was plain that this well referred to much that they both
the princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her
legs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in her
prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and
devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasili
and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out as
a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a very
prince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now
on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression
which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes too seemed
strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next
the princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands looked attentively into prince vasilis eyes evidently resolved
not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning
well you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semenovna
continued prince vasili returning to his theme apparently not without
an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think of
everything one must think of the future of all of you i love you
all like children of my own as you know
the princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same
and then of course my family has also to be considered prince vasili
went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at her
you know catiche that we you three sisters mamontov and my wife
are the counts only direct heirs i know i know how hard it is for you
to talk or think of such matters it is no easier for me but my dear
i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything do you know
i have sent for pierre the count pointing to his portrait
prince vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could not make
out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she
replied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his
yes yes of course interrupted prince vasili impatiently rubbing
his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that
he had pushed away but in short the fact is you know yourself
that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre
he has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but he
cannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimate
but my dear said prince vasili suddenly clutching the little table
and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter
has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierres
legitimation do you understand that in consideration of the counts
the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
subject under discussion than those they are talking with
i can tell you more continued prince vasili seizing her hand that
letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew of it
the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not then as soon
as all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by
the words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will and
letter will be delivered to the emperor and the petition will certainly
be granted pierre will get everything as the legitimate son
and our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything
but my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be the
legal heir to everything and you wont get anything you must know my
dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have
been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked you
ought to know where they are and must find them because
what next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think we are
all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un
batard  she added as if supposing that this translation of the word
would effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of his
well really catiche cant you understand you are so intelligent
how is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to the
emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it follows that
pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhov and will then
inherit everything under the will and if the will and letter are not
destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been
dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit  thats certain
i know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and you
mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with
the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something
my dear princess catherine semenovna began prince vasili impatiently
i came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interests
as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i tell you for the
tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierres
favor are among the counts papers then my dear girl you and your
sisters are not heiresses if you dont believe me then believe an
expert i have just been talking to dmitri onufrich the family
at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas her
thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice when
she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
that would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and i
she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress
and this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have
sacrificed everything for his sake she cried its splendid fine i
yes but you are not the only one there are your sisters replied
but the princess did not listen to him
yes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expect
nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitude the
do you or do you not know where that will is insisted prince vasili
yes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them and
sacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who has
the princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand she
had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race
there is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it was
all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards
forgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his
last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let
him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who
who sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who would
again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though he
never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh i
shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward that
in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one has
now come come be reasonable i know your excellent heart
i know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendship and
wish you to have as good an opinion of me dont upset yourself and let
us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an
hour tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is
you must know we will take it at once and show it to the count he has
no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it you understand that
my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my
only reason for being here i came simply to help him and you
now i see it all i know who has been intriguing i know cried the
its that protege of yours that sweet princess drubetskaya that anna
mikhaylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid the infamous vile
ah dont talk to me last winter she wheedled herself in here and told
the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about
sophie i cant repeat them that it made the count quite ill and he
would not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote this
vile infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalid
weve got to it at last why did you not tell me about it sooner
its in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said the
princess ignoring his question now i know yes if i have a sin a
great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the
princess now quite changed and what does she come worming herself in
here for but i will give her a piece of my mind the time will come
while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for and
anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving
into the court of count bezukhovs house as the wheels rolled softly
over the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovna having turned with
words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his
corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre followed anna
mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the
interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they
had not come to the front entrance but to the back door while he was
getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like
tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of
the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other men of the
same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neither
anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help
seeing these people took any notice of them it seems to be all
right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she hurriedly
ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre who
was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was
necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go
by the back stairs yet judging by anna mikhaylovnas air of assurance
and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary
halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who
carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering these
men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass
and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there
is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikhaylovna
yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now
perhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached the
landing id better go to my own room
anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up
ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sons
when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no less than
but really hadnt i better go away he asked looking kindly at her
ah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you
think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death she
sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself to
me pierre i shall not forget your interests
pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had
to be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was
this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the
princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past
with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the
princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage the first
door on the left led into the princesses apartments the maid with the
decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house
was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in
passing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasili and the
eldest princess were sitting close together talking seeing them pass
prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience while the princess
jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all
this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
prince vasilis face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide anna
mikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as
if to say that this was no more than she had expected
be a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in
reply to his look and went still faster along the passage
pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what
watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these
things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly lit
room adjoining the counts reception room it was one of those sumptuous
but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach but
even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been
spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a
servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they went into
the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows opening
into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of
catherine the great the same people were still sitting here in almost
the same positions as before whispering to one another all became
silent and turned to look at the pale tear worn anna mikhaylovna as she
entered and at the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his head
anna mikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now
keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than
that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person the
dying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapid
glance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessor
there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet
seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing
first of one and then of another priest
god be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests
all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is the
counts son she added more softly what a terrible moment
having said this she went up to the doctor
dear doctor said she this young man is the counts son is there
the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her
shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away
from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and
trust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and
wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it
pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved
toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikhaylovna had
disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they
whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind
of awe and even servility a deference such as he had never before
received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to
the priests rose and offered him her seat an aide de camp picked up
and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully
silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre
wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to
pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and
that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite
which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to
accept their services he took the glove in silence from the aide de
camp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge hands
symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statue
and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in
order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erect
majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three
stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning
his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
pierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is well
but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated not
knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count
he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friend
pierres mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke
suggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili in
perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and
the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door
through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at
last anna mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute
in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm
the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered
pierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed
that the strange lady the aide de camp and some of the servants all
followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to
pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its
walls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind the
columns with a high silk curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on
the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated
with red light like a russian church during evening service under the
gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowy
white smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre saw covered to
the waist by a bright green quilt the familiar majestic figure of his
father count bezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad
forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically
noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay just under the icons
his large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which was
lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and
thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it
in position by the chair stood the priests their long hair falling
over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in
their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behind
them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their
eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a
vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though
declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance
round anna mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and all forgiving
expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady prince
vasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his
left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair
he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his
right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead
his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god
if you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so
behind him stood the aide de camp the doctors and the menservants the
men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossing
themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting
of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna with an
air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was
about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a
taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him began
crossing himself with the hand that held the taper
sophie the rosy laughter loving youngest princess with the mole
watched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained
with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she again
began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him without
laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of
temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered
to one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand got
up and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna stepped forward
and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind her
back the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the
columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite
of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite
now being performed and even approved of it he now approached the sick
man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his
delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was
free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment the
sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then
the people resumed their places and the service continued during this
interval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he
had been leaning and with an air which intimated that he knew what he
was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
for them did not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the
eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood
the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed both
prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door but returned
to their places one after the other before the service was concluded
pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of
what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw
happening around him that evening was in some way essential
the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before around
him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which
