monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you
he who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost
ah its you you scamp said he you shall have nothing
he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed
he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin he wanted to make it good
the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the
month of february there had been rain the roads were bad and then
it was no longer the tilbury the cart was very heavy and in addition
he took nearly four hours to go from hesdin to saint pol four hours for
at saint pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to
and led to the stable as he had promised scaufflaire he stood beside
the manger while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing
the inn keepers wife came to the stable
come that is true i even have a good appetite
he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the
public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth
make haste said he i must start again i am in a hurry
a big flemish servant maid placed his knife and fork in all haste he
looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort
that is what ailed me he thought i had not breakfasted
his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then
slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again
a carter was eating at another table he said to this man
the carter was a german and did not understand him
he returned to the stable and remained near the horse
an hour later he had quitted saint pol and was directing his course
towards tinques which is only five leagues from arras
what did he do during this journey of what was he thinking as in the
morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the tilled fields
pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the
road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes
suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought what is more
melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the
first and the last time to travel is to be born and to die at every
instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind he did make
comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence all
the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us the dark and
bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse
we look we hasten we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing
each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel
a shock all is black we distinguish an obscure door the gloomy
horse of life which has been drawing us halts and we see a veiled and
twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school
beheld this traveller enter tinques it is true that the days were still
short he did not halt at tinques as he emerged from the village a
laborer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said
the poor beast was in fact going at a walk
are you going to arras added the road mender
if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early
he stopped his horse and asked the laborer
how far is it from here to arras
how is that the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter
ah returned the road mender so you dont know that the road is
under repair you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on
you will take the road on the left leading to carency you will cross
the river when you reach camblin you will turn to the right that is
the road to mont saint eloy which leads to arras
but it is night and i shall lose my way
and besides it is all cross roads stop sir resumed the
road mender shall i give you a piece of advice your horse is tired
return to tinques there is a good inn there sleep there you can reach
that is different but go to the inn all the same and get an extra
horse the stable boy will guide you through the cross roads
he followed the road menders advice retraced his steps and half an
hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed
with a good horse to aid a stable boy who called himself a postilion
was seated on the shaft of the cariole
still he felt that he had lost time
they turned into the cross road the way became frightfully bad the
cart lurched from one rut to the other he said to the postilion
keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee
in one of the jolts the whiffle tree broke
theres the whiffle tree broken sir said the postilion i dont
know how to harness my horse now this road is very bad at night if
you wish to return and sleep at tinques we could be in arras early
he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife
he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle tree of it
this caused another loss of twenty minutes but they set out again at a
the plain was gloomy low hanging black crisp fogs crept over the
hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke there were whitish gleams
in the clouds a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a
sound in all quarters of the horizon as of some one moving furniture
everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror how many
things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night
he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before
he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in
the neighborhood of d  eight years previously and it seemed but
the hour struck from a distant tower he asked the boy
seven oclock sir we shall reach arras at eight we have but three
at that moment he for the first time indulged in this reflection
thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner that
all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did
not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should at least
have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight
ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not then
he sketched out some calculations in his mind that ordinarily the
sittings of the court of assizes began at nine oclock in the morning
that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the apples would
be very brief that there would then remain only a question of identity
four or five depositions and very little for the lawyers to say that
the postilion whipped up the horses they had crossed the river and left
chapter vi sister simplice put to the proof
she had passed a very bad night her cough was frightful her fever
had doubled in intensity she had had dreams in the morning when the
doctor paid his visit she was delirious he assumed an alarmed look
and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m madeleine arrived
all the morning she was melancholy said but little and laid plaits
in her sheets murmuring the while in a low voice calculations
which seemed to be calculations of distances her eyes were hollow and
staring they seemed almost extinguished at intervals then lighted up
again and shone like stars it seems as though at the approach of a
certain dark hour the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the
each time that sister simplice asked her how she felt she replied
invariably well i should like to see m madeleine
some months before this at the moment when fantine had just lost her
last modesty her last shame and her last joy she was the shadow of
herself now she was the spectre of herself physical suffering had
completed the work of moral suffering this creature of five and twenty
had a wrinkled brow flabby cheeks pinched nostrils teeth from which
the gums had receded a leaden complexion a bony neck prominent
shoulder blades frail limbs a clayey skin and her golden hair was
growing out sprinkled with gray alas how illness improvises old age
at mid day the physician returned gave some directions inquired
whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary and shook
m madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three oclock as
about half past two fantine began to be restless in the course of
twenty minutes she asked the nun more than ten times what time is it
three oclock struck at the third stroke fantine sat up in bed she
who could in general hardly turn over joined her yellow fleshless
hands in a sort of convulsive clasp and the nun heard her utter one
of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection then fantine
no one entered the door did not open
she remained thus for a quarter of an hour her eyes riveted on the
door motionless and apparently holding her breath the sister dared not
speak to her the clock struck a quarter past three fantine fell back
she said nothing but began to plait the sheets once more
half an hour passed then an hour no one came every time the clock
struck fantine started up and looked towards the door then fell back
her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered no name she made
no complaint she blamed no one but she coughed in a melancholy way
one would have said that something dark was descending upon her she was
livid and her lips were blue she smiled now and then
five oclock struck then the sister heard her say very low and gently
he is wrong not to come to day since i am going away to morrow
sister simplice herself was surprised at m madeleines delay
in the meantime fantine was staring at the tester of her bed she
seemed to be endeavoring to recall something all at once she began to
sing in a voice as feeble as a breath the nun listened this is what
i love my love corn flowers are blue
yestereen the virgin mary came near my stove in a broidered mantle
clad and said to me here hide neath my veil the child whom you
one day begged from me haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy
dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons
decked god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast
granted me madame what shall i do with this linen fine make of it
roses are pink and corn flowers are blue
i love my love and corn flowers are blue
wash this linen where in the stream make of it soiling
not spoiling not a petticoat fair with its bodice fine which i will
embroider and fill with flowers madame the child is no longer here
what is to be done then make of it a winding sheet in which to bury
i love my love corn flowers are blue
this song was an old cradle romance with which she had in former days
lulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recurred to her
mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her
child she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air that it
was enough to make any one even a nun weep the sister accustomed as
she was to austerities felt a tear spring to her eyes
the clock struck six fantine did not seem to hear it she no longer
seemed to pay attention to anything about her
sister simplice sent a serving maid to inquire of the portress of the
factory whether the mayor had returned and if he would not come to the
infirmary soon the girl returned in a few minutes
fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone that the
mayor had set out that morning before six oclock in a little tilbury
harnessed to a white horse cold as the weather was that he had gone
alone without even a driver that no one knew what road he had taken
that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras that
others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris that when he
went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told
the portress not to expect him that night
while the two women were whispering together with their backs turned
to fantines bed the sister interrogating the servant conjecturing
fantine with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which
unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of
death had raised herself to her knees in bed with her shrivelled hands
resting on the bolster and her head thrust through the opening of the
curtains and was listening all at once she cried
you are speaking of m madeleine why are you talking so low what is
her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard
the voice of a man they wheeled round in affright
the portress told me that he could not come to day
be calm my child said the sister lie down again
fantine without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and
with an accent that was both imperious and heart rending
he cannot come why not you know the reason you are whispering it to
each other there i want to know it
the servant maid hastened to say in the nuns ear say that he is busy
sister simplice blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had
on the other hand it seemed to her that the mere communication of the
truth to the invalid would without doubt deal her a terrible blow and
that this was a serious matter in fantines present state her flush
did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes to fantine and
fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed her eyes
sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face
gone she cried he has gone to get cosette
then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable
her lips moved she was praying in a low voice
when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie
down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg
your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly
i know that well my good sister but you see i am very happy the
good god is good m madeleine is good just think he has gone to
she lay down again with the nuns assistance helped the nun to arrange
her pillow and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her
neck and which sister simplice had given her
my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk any
fantine took the sisters hand in her moist hands and the latter was
he set out this morning for paris in fact he need not even go through
paris montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence do you
remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette
soon soon he wants to give me a surprise you know he made me sign a
letter so that she could be taken from the thenardiers they cannot
say anything can they they will give back cosette for they have been
paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they
have received their pay do not make signs to me that i must not talk
sister i am extremely happy i am doing well i am not ill at all any
more i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is
nearly five years since i saw her last you cannot imagine how much
attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will
see if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had in the
first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous
hands when she was only a year old like this she must be a big girl
now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her
cosette but her name is really euphrasie stop this morning i was
looking at the dust on the chimney piece and i had a sort of idea come
across me like that that i should see cosette again soon mon dieu
how wrong it is not to see ones children for years one ought to
reflect that life is not eternal oh how good m le maire is to go it
is very cold it is true he had on his cloak at least he will be
here to morrow will he not to morrow will be a festival day to morrow
morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has
lace on it what a place that montfermeil is i took that journey on
foot once it was very long for me but the diligences go very quickly
he will be here to morrow with cosette how far is it from here to
the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that he
to morrow to morrow said fantine i shall see cosette to morrow
you see good sister of the good god that i am no longer ill i am mad
i could dance if any one wished it
a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have
understood the change she was all rosy now she spoke in a lively and
natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked
she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile
well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not
fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice yes
lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sister
simplice is right every one here is right
and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to
stare all about her with wide open eyes and a joyous air and she said
the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would
fall into a doze between seven and eight oclock the doctor came not
hearing any sound he thought fantine was asleep entered softly and
approached the bed on tiptoe he opened the curtains a little and by
the light of the taper he saw fantines big eyes gazing at him
she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little
the doctor thought that she was delirious she added
the doctor took sister simplice aside and she explained matters to him
that m madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt
they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid who believed that
the mayor had gone to montfermeil that it was possible after all that
he returned to fantines bed and she went on
you see when she wakes up in the morning i shall be able to say good
morning to her poor kitten and when i cannot sleep at night i can
hear her asleep her little gentle breathing will do me good
she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh
ah hold in truth you did not know it i am cured cosette will
the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest
had decreased her pulse had regained its strength a sort of life had
suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor worn out creature
doctor she went on did the sister tell you that m le maire has
gone to get that mite of a child
the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be
avoided he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona and in case the
fever should increase again during the night a calming potion as he
took his departure he said to the sister
she is doing better if good luck willed that the mayor should
actually arrive to morrow with the child who knows there are crises
so astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well
that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state but all those
things are such mysteries we may be able to save her
chapter vii the traveller on his arrival takes precautions for
it was nearly eight oclock in the evening when the cart which we
left on the road entered the porte cochere of the hotel de la poste in
arras the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted
from it responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the
people of the inn sent back the extra horse and with his own hands
led the little white horse to the stable then he opened the door of a
billiard room which was situated on the ground floor sat down there
and leaned his elbows on a table he had taken fourteen hours for
the journey which he had counted on making in six he did himself the
justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault but at bottom he was
does monsieur wish a bed does monsieur require supper
he made a sign of the head in the negative
the stableman says that monsieurs horse is extremely fatigued
will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to morrow
oh monsieur he must rest for two days at least
the hostess conducted him to the office he showed his passport and
inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to m
sur m by the mail wagon the seat beside the post boy chanced to be
vacant he engaged it and paid for it monsieur said the clerk
do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one oclock in the
this done he left the hotel and began to wander about the town
he was not acquainted with arras the streets were dark and he
walked on at random but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the
passers by he crossed the little river crinchon and found himself in a
labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way a citizen was passing
along with a lantern after some hesitation he decided to apply to this
man not without having first glanced behind and in front of him as
though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was
monsieur said he where is the court house if you please
you do not belong in town sir replied the bourgeois who was an
oldish man well follow me i happen to be going in the direction of
the court house that is to say in the direction of the hotel of the
prefecture for the court house is undergoing repairs just at this
moment and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the
is it there that the assizes are held he asked
certainly sir you see the prefecture of to day was the bishops
palace before the revolution m de conzie who was bishop in 82 built
a grand hall there it is in this grand hall that the court is held
on the way the bourgeois said to him
if monsieur desires to witness a case it is rather late the sittings
when they arrived on the grand square however the man pointed out to
him four long windows all lighted up in the front of a vast and gloomy
upon my word sir you are in luck you have arrived in season do you
see those four windows that is the court of assizes there is light
there so they are not through the matter must have been greatly
protracted and they are holding an evening session do you take an
interest in this affair is it a criminal case are you a witness
i have not come on any business i only wish to speak to one of the
that is different said the bourgeois stop sir here is the door
where the sentry stands you have only to ascend the grand staircase
he conformed to the bourgeoiss directions and a few minutes later he
was in a hall containing many people and where groups intermingled
with lawyers in their gowns were whispering together here and there
it is always a heart breaking thing to see these congregations of men
robed in black murmuring together in low voices on the threshold of
the halls of justice it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome
of these words condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely
to be the result all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful
observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert
this spacious hall illuminated by a single lamp was the old hall of
the episcopal palace and served as the large hall of the palace
of justice a double leaved door which was closed at that moment
separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting
the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer
what stage have they reached sir he asked
this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round
excuse me sir perhaps you are a relative
no i know no one here has judgment been pronounced
he continued in a voice so weak that it was barely audible
what identity replied the lawyer there was no identity to be
established the matter was very simple the woman had murdered her
child the infanticide was proved the jury threw out the question of
why certainly the limosin woman of what are you speaking
nothing but since it is all over how comes it that the hall is still
for another case which was begun about two hours ago
oh this one is a clear case also it is about a sort of blackguard
a man arrested for a second offence a convict who has been guilty of
theft i dont know his name exactly theres a bandits phiz for you
id send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone
is there any way of getting into the court room sir said he
i really think that there is not there is a great crowd however
the hearing has been suspended some people have gone out and when the
hearing is resumed you might make an effort
the lawyer left him in the course of a few moments he had experienced
almost simultaneously almost intermingled with each other all possible
emotions the words of this indifferent spectator had in turn pierced
his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire when he saw that
nothing was settled he breathed freely once more but he could not have
told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure
he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying the
docket of the session was very heavy the president had appointed
for the same day two short and simple cases they had begun with the
infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the
return horse this man had stolen apples but that did not appear to
be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been
in the galleys at toulon it was that which lent a bad aspect to
his case however the mans examination and the depositions of the
witnesses had been completed but the lawyers plea and the speech
of the public prosecutor were still to come it could not be
finished before midnight the man would probably be condemned the
attorney general was very clever and never missed his culprits he was
an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the assizes
it will not be opened at all replied the usher
what it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed is not the
the hearing has just been begun again replied the usher but the
what there is not room for one more
not another one the door is closed no one can enter now
the usher added after a pause there are to tell the truth two
or three extra places behind monsieur le president but monsieur le
he retired with bowed head traversed the antechamber and slowly
descended the stairs as though hesitating at every step it is probable
that he was holding counsel with himself the violent conflict which had
been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended
and every moment he encountered some new phase of it on reaching the
landing place he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his
arms all at once he opened his coat drew out his pocket book took
from it a pencil tore out a leaf and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly
by the light of the street lantern this line m madeleine mayor of m
sur m then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides made
his way through the crowd walked straight up to the usher handed him
the paper and said in an authoritative manner
the usher took the paper cast a glance upon it and obeyed
although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of m sur m enjoyed
a sort of celebrity for the space of seven years his reputation for
virtue had filled the whole of bas boulonnais it had eventually passed
the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through
two or three neighboring departments besides the service which he had
rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry
there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the
arrondissement of m sur m which was not indebted to him for some
benefit he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the
industries of other arrondissements it was thus that he had when
occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen
factory at boulogne the flax spinning industry at frevent and the
hydraulic manufacture of cloth at boubers sur canche everywhere the
name of m madeleine was pronounced with veneration arras and douai
envied the happy little town of m sur m its mayor
the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this
session of the assizes at arras was acquainted in common with the rest
of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally
honored when the usher discreetly opening the door which connected
the council chamber with the court room bent over the back of the
presidents arm chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed
the line which we have just perused adding the gentleman desires to
be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential
movement seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper
and returned it to the usher saying admit him
the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door
of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher
had left him in the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to
him will monsieur do me the honor to follow me it was the same usher
who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was
now bowing to the earth before him at the same time the usher handed
him the paper he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light
the president of the court of assizes presents his respects to m
he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him
a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted
cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a
table with a green cloth the last words of the usher who had just
quitted him still rang in his ears monsieur you are now in the
council chamber you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door
and you will find yourself in the court room behind the presidents
chair these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of
narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed
the usher had left him alone the supreme moment had arrived he sought
to collect his faculties but could not it is chiefly at the moment
when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful
realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain he
was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned with
stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment
where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his
name and which his fate was at that moment traversing he stared at
the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that
he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the
jolts of the cart but he was not conscious of it it seemed to him that
he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which
contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas
pache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no
doubt the 9th of june of the year ii and in which pache forwarded to
the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them
any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment and who had
watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him
as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and he read it
two or three times he read it without paying any attention to it and
unconsciously he was thinking of fantine and cosette
as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob
of the door which separated him from the court of assizes he had almost
forgotten that door his glance calm at first paused there remained
fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little
became impregnated with fear beads of perspiration burst forth among
his hair and trickled down upon his temples
at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of
authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which
does so well convey pardieu who compels me to this then he wheeled
briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in
front of him went to it opened it and passed out he was no longer
in that chamber he was outside in a corridor a long narrow corridor
broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted
here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the
corridor through which he had approached he breathed he listened not
a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued
when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened the
same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him he was
out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall the stone was
cold the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow he straightened himself
then there alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with
he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard
within him but one voice which said alas
a quarter of an hour passed thus at length he bowed his head sighed
with agony dropped his arms and retraced his steps he walked slowly
and as though crushed it seemed as though some one had overtaken him in
he re entered the council chamber the first thing he caught sight of
was the knob of the door this knob which was round and of polished
brass shone like a terrible star for him he gazed at it as a lamb
might gaze into the eye of a tiger
he could not take his eyes from it from time to time he advanced a step
had he listened he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall
like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not
suddenly without himself knowing how it happened he found himself near
the door he grasped the knob convulsively the door opened
chapter ix a place where convictions are in process of formation
he advanced a pace closed the door mechanically behind him and
it was a vast and badly lighted apartment now full of uproar now full
of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty
and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of
at the one end of the hall the one where he was were judges with
abstracted air in threadbare robes who were gnawing their nails or
closing their eyelids at the other end a ragged crowd lawyers in
all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient
spotted woodwork a dirty ceiling tables covered with serge that was
yellow rather than green doors blackened by handmarks tap room
lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in
the wainscot on the tables candles in brass candlesticks darkness
ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and
august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is
called the law and that grand divine thing which is called justice
no one in all that throng paid any attention to him all glances were
directed towards a single point a wooden bench placed against a small
door in the stretch of wall on the presidents left on this bench
illuminated by several candles sat a man between two gendarmes
he did not seek him he saw him his eyes went thither naturally as
though they had known beforehand where that figure was
he thought he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same
in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his
bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as
it was on the day when he entered d  full of hatred concealing
his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent
nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison
he said to himself with a shudder good god shall i become like that
this creature seemed to be at least sixty there was something
at the sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make
way for him the president had turned his head and understanding that
the personage who had just entered was the mayor of m sur m he had
bowed to him the attorney general who had seen m madeleine at m
sur m whither the duties of his office had called him more than once
recognized him and saluted him also he had hardly perceived it he was
the victim of a sort of hallucination he was watching
judges clerks gendarmes a throng of cruelly curious heads all these
he had already beheld once in days gone by twenty seven years before
he had encountered those fatal things once more there they were they
moved they existed it was no longer an effort of his memory a mirage
of his thought they were real gendarmes and real judges a real
crowd and real men of flesh and blood it was all over he beheld the
monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him
with all that there is formidable in reality
he was horrified by it he shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest
and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble and
rendered him nearly mad it was another self of his that was there all
called that man who was being tried jean valjean
under his very eyes unheard of vision he had a sort of representation
of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre
everything was there the apparatus was the same the hour of the night
the faces of the judges of soldiers and of spectators all were the
same only above the presidents head there hung a crucifix something
which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation god had
there was a chair behind him he dropped into it terrified at the
thought that he might be seen when he was seated he took advantage of
a pile of cardboard boxes which stood on the judges desk to conceal
his face from the whole room he could now see without being seen he

or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible
likeness this man as the reader already knows was a vagabond who had
been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples broken
in the orchard of a neighbor called the pierron orchard who was this
man an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and they
were unanimous light had abounded throughout the entire debate the
accusation said we have in our grasp not only a marauder a stealer
of fruit we have here in our hands a bandit an old offender who
has broken his ban an ex convict a miscreant of the most dangerous
description a malefactor named jean valjean whom justice has long been

at toulon committed a highway robbery accompanied by violence on the
person of a child a savoyard named little gervais a crime provided
for by article 383 of the penal code the right to try him for which

judged for the old crime in the face of this accusation in the face
of the unanimity of the witnesses the accused appeared to be astonished
more than anything else he made signs and gestures which were meant to
convey no or else he stared at the ceiling he spoke with difficulty
replied with embarrassment but his whole person from head to foot was
a denial he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in
