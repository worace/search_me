man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to
laws which determine that life but the same man apart from that
connection appears to be free how should the past life of nations and
of humanity be regarded as the result of the free or as the result of
the constrained activity of man that is a question for history
only in our self confident day of the popularization of knowledge
thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of
printed matter has the question of the freedom of will been put on a
level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the
majority of so called advanced people that is the crowd of
ignoramuses have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one
side of the question for a solution of the whole problem
they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for
the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul and
free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of
years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never
been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of
one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of
observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and
that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals
at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the
truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and
philosophic theories that from the point of view of reason man is
subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a hairs
breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side
if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as
comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a
certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the
time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how
mans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we can
observe only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observe
consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity
the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this
question are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a
church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief
superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the
windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should be
delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is now
for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability history
has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to
the essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the past and
in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as
the subject for history is not mans will itself but our presentation of
and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the
incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does
for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of
mans life in which the union of these two contradictions has already
in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly
and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although
each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory
to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what
constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of
history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
inevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of life
under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the
conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we
may consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans free
will and partly of the law of inevitability
whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of
the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of someones
action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and
inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but
every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of
freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more
freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and
the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but
their relation is always one of inverse proportion
a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother
exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to
discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man
seem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of
necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks
and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who
considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every
action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less
free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one
who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is
increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is
correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view
from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of
necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa
religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and
history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and
all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations
1 the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds
3 his relation to the causes leading to the action
the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mans
relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of
our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in
relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it
evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man
closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one
bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free
and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around
him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to
anything around him if we see his connection with anything whatever
with a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is
engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the
things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an
influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity and
the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his
freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that
the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of
the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place
the mans action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the
fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race
appear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today it is
the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago
and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me
the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this
respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance
of the action and our judgment of it
if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same
circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly
free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in
different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had
not been committed much that resulted from it good agreeable and even
essential would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still
more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action
are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have
happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in
memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my
judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the
part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a
contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
known participants but with a more remote event we already see its
inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible
and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
the austro prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to
us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes
will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared
as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration
of the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that the
renovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice the
farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more
doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless
chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each
phenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have its
definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of
the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and
historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled
and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and
historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are
observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a
crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a
greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently
demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we
rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it
more individuality originality and independence but if even one of
the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime
or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom
of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male
factors mitigates his fault in our eyes the self sacrifice of a father
or mother or self sacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more
comprehensible than gratuitous self sacrifice and therefore seems less
deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a
sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by
what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of
examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
correlation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actions
appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and
had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of
their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the
son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into
bad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on are
actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause
if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of
mental development like a child a madman or a simpleton then
knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so
little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
on these three considerations alone is based the conception of
irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less
according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to
the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the
action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser
understanding of the causes that led to the action
thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes
or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the
external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the
greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we
so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
external world is well known where the time between the action and its
examination is great and where the causes of the action are most
accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external
conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of
whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of
in neither case however we may change our point of view however plain
we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the
period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of
the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or
1 to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in
space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems
to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every
direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was
least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from
the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible
directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to
be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to
conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is
2 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an
action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being
free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was
committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have
abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to
convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not
now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the
question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then
lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor
is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the
moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that
moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made
would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does
not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i
could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not
have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine
it in the present on the boundary between the past and the future that
3 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an
absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
expression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demand
of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a
cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action
independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a
but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining
only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any cause we were
to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled
zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete
freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing
outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man
in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability
1 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in
which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the
number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and
therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined
there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
2 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while
time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
3 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we
shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we
but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to
equal zero we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a
dying man an unborn babe or an idiot complete absence of freedom by
so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are
examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and
so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
the conception of a mans completely free action
and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an
infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time
to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time
in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we
should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
inevitability itself that is a mere form without content
in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we
should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and
cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which mans
whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible
essence of life and the laws defining that essence
reason says 1 space with all the forms of matter that give it
visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise 2 time is
infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise
3 the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can
consciousness says 1 i alone am and all that exists is but me
consequently i include space 2 i measure flowing time by the fixed
moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living
consequently i am outside time 3 i am beyond cause for i feel myself
to be the cause of every manifestation of my life
reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness
freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mans
consciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in its
freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom
only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another
as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately
only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans life
apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one
another as form and content no conception of life is possible
all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free
will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason
all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of
the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal
force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but
felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we
know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first
knowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so too the
force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies
up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws
all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
mans free will differs from every other force in that man is directly
conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any
other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical
affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
differently defined by reason just so the force of mans free will is
distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the
definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is
apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from
gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason
it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life
and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies
the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of
chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of
astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the
same way does the force of free will form the content of history but
just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will
in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the
subject of history while free will itself is the subject of
in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is
only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know
so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability
what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an
expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of
history examines the manifestations of mans free will in connection
with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it
defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science
only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws
the recognition of mans free will as something capable of influencing
historical events that is as not subject to laws is the same for
history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws
that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving
freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no
conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if
any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law
can exist nor any conception of historical events
for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of
which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
consciousness of mans will in the present moves in space time and
the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more
evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws
from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in
mans freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible
for however mans free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize
it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes
only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that
is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince
ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then
instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as
the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
with the self destruction toward which ever dissecting and dissecting
the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving
all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at
infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the
process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of
unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of
cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all
in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences
have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all
bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the
movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies
from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by
the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for
laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object
the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside
the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the
from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mere
recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disproving
that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the
movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem
impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the
discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still
from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that mode
of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
conditions and that certain relations of population to soil produce
migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built
by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
studying historic events as the results of mans free will for if a
certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of
peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic
ethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of those
individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause
and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology
the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old
views and accused the new of violating revelation but when truth
conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new
just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between
the old and the new conception of history and theology in the same way
stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting
in the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes
passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret for
the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the other
to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy
it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in
god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the
son of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to
voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil
and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
so too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law of
inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though
the law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus in
astronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which
the institutions of state and church are erected
as in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history now
the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or
nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible
phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history
it is the independence of personality free will
as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and of
the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing
the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies
in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones own
personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we
do not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility
we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not
feel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is
true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our
free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on
the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws
in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel in
the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that
does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
