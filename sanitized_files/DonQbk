yes i am said sancho and im proud of it
faith then said the gentleman this new author does not handle you
with the decency that displays itself in your person he makes you out a
heavy feeder and a fool and not in the least droll and a very different
being from the sancho described in the first part of your masters
god forgive him said sancho he might have left me in my corner
without troubling his head about me let him who knows how ring the
bells saint peter is very well in rome
the two gentlemen pressed don quixote to come into their room and have
supper with them as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn
fit for one of his sort don quixote who was always polite yielded to
their request and supped with them sancho stayed behind with the stew
and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head
of the table and the landlord sat down with him for he was no less fond
of cow heel and calves feet than sancho was
while at supper don juan asked don quixote what news he had of the lady
dulcinea del toboso was she married had she been brought to bed or was
she with child or did she in maidenhood still preserving her modesty
and delicacy cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of senor don
to this he replied dulcinea is a maiden still and my passion more
firmly rooted than ever our intercourse unsatisfactory as before and
her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench and then he
proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment
of dulcinea and of what had happened him in the cave of montesinos
together with what the sage merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment
exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from
hearing don quixote recount the strange incidents of his history and if
they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the
elegant style in which he delivered them on the one hand they regarded
him as a man of wit and sense and on the other he seemed to them a
maundering blockhead and they could not make up their minds whereabouts
between wisdom and folly they ought to place him
sancho having finished his supper and left the landlord in the x
condition repaired to the room where his master was and as he came in
said may i die sirs if the author of this book your worships have got
has any mind that we should agree as he calls me glutton according to
what your worships say i wish he may not call me drunkard too
but he does said don jeronimo i cannot remember however in what
way though i know his words are offensive and what is more lying as i
can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy sancho before me
believe me said sancho the sancho and the don quixote of this
history must be different persons from those that appear in the one cide
hamete benengeli wrote who are ourselves my master valiant wise and
true in love and i simple droll and neither glutton nor drunkard
i believe it said don juan and were it possible an order should be
issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything
relating to don quixote save his original author cide hamete just as
alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save
let him who will paint me said don quixote but let him not abuse me
for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it
none can be offered to senor don quixote said don juan that he
himself will not be able to avenge if he does not ward it off with the
shield of his patience which i take it is great and strong
a considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort
and though don juan wished don quixote to read more of the book to see
what it was all about he was not to be prevailed upon saying that he
treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly and if by any chance
it should come to its authors ears that he had it in his hand he did
not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it for
our thoughts and still more our eyes should keep themselves aloof from
they asked him whither he meant to direct his steps he replied to
saragossa to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that
city every year don juan told him that the new history described how don
quixote let him be who he might took part there in a tilting at the
ring utterly devoid of invention poor in mottoes very poor in costume
for that very reason said don quixote i will not set foot in
saragossa and by that means i shall expose to the world the lie of this
new history writer and people will see that i am not the don quixote he
you will do quite right said don jeronimo and there are other jousts
at barcelona in which senor don quixote may display his prowess
that is what i mean to do said don quixote and as it is now time i
pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed and to place and
retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants
and me too said sancho maybe ill be good for something
with this they exchanged farewells and don quixote and sancho retired to
their room leaving don juan and don jeronimo amazed to see the medley he
made of his good sense and his craziness and they felt thoroughly
convinced that these and not those their aragonese author described
were the genuine don quixote and sancho don quixote rose betimes and
bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room
sancho paid the landlord magnificently and recommended him either to say
less about the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided
of what happened don quixote on his way to barcelona
it was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as don quixote
quitted the inn first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct
road to barcelona without touching upon saragossa so anxious was he to
make out this new historian who they said abused him so to be a liar
well as it fell out nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for
six days at the end of which having turned aside out of the road he
was overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees for on this
point cide hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters
master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had
settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good
noontide meal that day let himself without more ado pass the gates of
sleep but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept
awake could not close an eye and roamed in fancy to and fro through all
sorts of places at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave
of montesinos and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench
skipping and mounting upon her she ass again that the words of the sage
merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be
observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
he lost all patience when he considered the laziness and want of charity
of his squire sancho for to the best of his belief he had only given
himself five lashes a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast
number required at this thought he felt such vexation and anger that he
reasoned the matter thus if alexander the great cut the gordian knot
saying to cut comes to the same thing as to untie and yet did not
fail to become lord paramount of all asia neither more nor less could
happen now in dulcineas disenchantment if i scourge sancho against his
will for if it is the condition of the remedy that sancho shall receive
three thousand and odd lashes what does it matter to me whether he
inflicts them himself or some one else inflicts them when the essential
point is that he receives them let them come from whatever quarter they
with this idea he went over to sancho having first taken rocinantes
reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them and began
to untie the points the common belief is he had but one in front by
which his breeches were held up but the instant he approached him sancho
woke up in his full senses and cried out what is this who is touching
it is i said don quixote and i come to make good thy shortcomings
and relieve my own distresses i come to whip thee sancho and wipe off
some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken dulcinea is perishing
thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore
untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired
spot to give thee at least two thousand lashes
not a bit of it said sancho let your worship keep quiet or else by
the living god the deaf shall hear us the lashes i pledged myself to
must be voluntary and not forced upon me and just now i have no fancy to
whip myself it is enough if i give you my word to flog and flap myself
it will not do to leave it to thy courtesy sancho said don quixote
for thou art hard of heart and though a clown tender of flesh and at
the same time he strove and struggled to untie him
seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him
with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched
him on the ground on his back and pressing his right knee on his chest
held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe
how now traitor exclaimed don quixote dost thou revolt against thy
master and natural lord dost thou rise against him who gives thee his
i neither put down king nor set up king said sancho i only stand up
for myself who am my own lord if your worship promises me to be quiet
and not to offer to whip me now ill let you go free and unhindered if
don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not
to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely
free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased
sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about
to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his
head and putting up his hands encountered somebodys two feet with shoes
and stockings on them he trembled with fear and made for another tree
where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting
calling upon don quixote to come and protect him don quixote did so and
asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of sancho
replied that all the trees were full of mens feet and legs don quixote
felt them and guessed at once what it was and said to sancho thou
hast nothing to be afraid of for these feet and legs that thou feelest
but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that
have been hanged on these trees for the authorities in these parts are
wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them
whereby i conjecture that i must be near barcelona and it was in fact
as he supposed with the first light they looked up and saw that the
fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters bodies
and now day dawned and if the dead freebooters had scared them their
hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones who all of
a sudden surrounded them and in the catalan tongue bade them stand and
wait until their captain came up don quixote was on foot with his horse
unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely
defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his
head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity
the robbers made haste to search dapple and did not leave him a single
thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise and lucky it
was for sancho that the dukes crowns and those he brought from home were
in a girdle that he wore round him but for all that these good folk
would have stripped him and even looked to see what he had hidden
between the skin and flesh but for the arrival at that moment of their
captain who was about thirty four years of age apparently strongly
built above the middle height of stern aspect and swarthy complexion
he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with
four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist he
saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were
about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at
once obeyed so the girdle escaped he wondered to see the lance leaning
against the tree the shield on the ground and don quixote in armour and
dejected with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself
could produce and going up to him he said be not so cast down good
man for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman busiris but
into roque guinarts which are more merciful than cruel
the cause of my dejection returned don quixote is not that i have
fallen into thy hands o valiant roque whose fame is bounded by no
limits on earth but that my carelessness should have been so great that
thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled when it is my duty
according to the rule of knight errantry which i profess to be always on
the alert and at all times my own sentinel for let me tell thee great
roque had they found me on my horse with my lance and shield it would
not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission for i am don
quixote of la mancha he who hath filled the whole world with his
roque guinart at once perceived that don quixotes weakness was more akin
to madness than to swagger and though he had sometimes heard him spoken
of he never regarded the things attributed to him as true nor could he
persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of
man he was extremely glad therefore to meet him and test at close
quarters what he had heard of him at a distance so he said to him
despair not valiant knight nor regard as an untoward fate the position
in which thou findest thyself it may be that by these slips thy crooked
fortune will make itself straight for heaven by strange circuitous ways
mysterious and incomprehensible to man raises up the fallen and makes
don quixote was about to thank him when they heard behind them a noise
as of a troop of horses there was however but one riding on which at
a furious pace came a youth apparently about twenty years of age clad
in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock with a
hat looped up in the walloon fashion tight fitting polished boots gilt
spurs dagger and sword and in his hand a musketoon and a pair of
roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure which
drawing near thus addressed him i came in quest of thee valiant roque
to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune and not
to keep thee in suspense for i see thou dost not recognise me i will
tell thee who i am i am claudia jeronima the daughter of simon forte
thy good friend and special enemy of clauquel torrellas who is thine
also as being of the faction opposed to thee thou knowest that this
torrellas has a son who is called or at least was not two hours since
don vicente torrellas well to cut short the tale of my misfortune i
will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me he saw
me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my father i
loved him for there is no woman however secluded she may live or close
she may be kept who will not have opportunities and to spare for
following her headlong impulses in a word he pledged himself to be
mine and i promised to be his without carrying matters any further
yesterday i learned that forgetful of his pledge to me he was about to
marry another and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth
intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me my father not being at
home i was able to adopt this costume you see and urging my horse to
speed i overtook don vicente about a league from this and without
waiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses i fired this musket at him
and these two pistols besides and to the best of my belief i must have
lodged more than two bullets in his body opening doors to let my honour
go free enveloped in his blood i left him there in the hands of his
servants who did not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence
and i come to seek from thee a safe conduct into france where i have
relatives with whom i can live and also to implore thee to protect my
father so that don vicentes numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak
roque filled with admiration at the gallant bearing high spirit comely
figure and adventure of the fair claudia said to her come senora
let us go and see if thy enemy is dead and then we will consider what
will be best for thee don quixote who had been listening to what
claudia said and roque guinart said in reply to her exclaimed nobody
need trouble himself with the defence of this lady for i take it upon
myself give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in
quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word
nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has
a very happy knack of matchmaking its not many days since he forced
another man to marry who in the same way backed out of his promise to
another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters
changing the mans proper shape into a lacqueys the said maiden would
roque who was paying more attention to the fair claudias adventure than
to the words of master or man did not hear them and ordering his
squires to restore to sancho everything they had stripped dapple of he
directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered during
the night and then set off with claudia at full speed in search of the
wounded or slain don vicente they reached the spot where claudia met
him but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood looking all round
however they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them and
concluded as indeed it proved to be that it was don vicente whom
either dead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds
or to bury him they made haste to overtake them which as the party
moved slowly they were able to do with ease they found don vicente in
the arms of his servants whom he was entreating in a broken feeble voice
to leave him there to die as the pain of his wounds would not suffer him
to go any farther claudia and roque threw themselves off their horses
and advanced towards him the servants were overawed by the appearance of
roque and claudia was moved by the sight of don vicente and going up to
him half tenderly half sternly she seized his hand and said to him
hadst thou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come
the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognising
claudia said i see clearly fair and mistaken lady that it is thou
that hast slain me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings
towards thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrong thee in thought
it is not true then said claudia that thou wert going this morning
to marry leonora the daughter of the rich balvastro
assuredly not replied don vicente my cruel fortune must have carried
those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take my life and
to assure thyself of this press my hands and take me for thy husband if
thou wilt i have no better satisfaction to offer thee for the wrong thou
claudia wrung his hands and her own heart was so wrung that she lay
fainting on the bleeding breast of don vicente whom a death spasm seized
the same instant roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do the
servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces and brought some and
bathed them with it claudia recovered from her fainting fit but not so
don vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him for his life had
come to an end on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced
herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her sighs
and made the heavens ring with her lamentations she tore her hair and
scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed
all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an
afflicted heart cruel reckless woman she cried how easily wert
thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked o furious force of jealousy
to what desperate lengths dost thou lead those that give thee lodging in
their bosoms o husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee
so vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of claudia that they
drew tears from roques eyes unused as they were to shed them on any
occasion the servants wept claudia swooned away again and again and
the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune in
the end roque guinart directed don vicentes servants to carry his body
to his fathers village which was close by for burial claudia told him
she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess where
she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse he
applauded her pious resolution and offered to accompany her
whithersoever she wished and to protect her father against the kinsmen
of don vicente and all the world should they seek to injure him claudia
would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for
his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears the servants
of don vicente carried away his body and roque returned to his comrades
and so ended the love of claudia jeronima but what wonder when it was
the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad
roque guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered
them and don quixote on rocinante in the midst of them delivering a
harangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full
of peril as well to the soul as to the body but as most of them were
gascons rough lawless fellows his speech did not make much impression
on them roque on coming up asked sancho if his men had returned and
restored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped off dapple
sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were worth three
what are you talking about man said one of the bystanders i have
got them and they are not worth three reals
that is true said don quixote but my squire values them at the rate
he says as having been given me by the person who gave them
roque guinart ordered them to be restored at once and making his men
fall in in line he directed all the clothing jewellery and money that
they had taken since the last distribution to be produced and making a
hasty valuation and reducing what could not be divided into money he
made shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully that in no
case did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice
when this had been done and all left satisfied roque observed to don
quixote if this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these
fellows there would be no living with them
upon this sancho remarked from what i have seen here justice is such a
good thing that there is no doing without it even among the thieves
one of the squires heard this and raising the butt end of his harquebuss
would no doubt have broken sanchos head with it had not roque guinart
called out to him to hold his hand sancho was frightened out of his
wits and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in the company of
at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels
on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to
their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people
not far off coming along the road to barcelona
to which roque replied hast thou made out whether they are of the sort
that are after us or of the sort we are after
the sort we are after said the squire
well then away with you all said roque and bring them here to me at
they obeyed and don quixote sancho and roque left by themselves
waited to see what the squires brought and while they were waiting roque
said to don quixote it must seem a strange sort of life to senor don
quixote this of ours strange adventures strange incidents and all
full of danger and i do not wonder that it should seem so for in truth
i must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours
what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong
enough to disturb the quietest hearts i am by nature tender hearted and
kindly but as i said the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was
done me so overturns all my better impulses that i keep on in this way of
life in spite of what conscience tells me and as one depth calls to
another and one sin to another sin revenges have linked themselves
together and i have taken upon myself not only my own but those of
others it pleases god however that though i see myself in this maze
of entanglements i do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching
don quixote was amazed to hear roque utter such excellent and just
sentiments for he did not think that among those who followed such
trades as robbing murdering and waylaying there could be anyone
capable of a virtuous thought and he said in reply senor roque the
beginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick mans
willingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes you are
sick you know what ails you and heaven or more properly speaking god
who is our physician will administer medicines that will cure you and
cure gradually and not of a sudden or by a miracle besides sinners of
discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools and as your
worship has shown good sense in your remarks all you have to do is to
keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience will
be strengthened and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and
put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will
show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many
hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances
they will lodge you in heaven in a trice
roque laughed at don quixotes exhortation and changing the conversation
he related the tragic affair of claudia jeronima at which sancho was
extremely grieved for he had not found the young womans beauty
and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with
them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach full
of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on
them and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them the
squires made a ring round them both victors and vanquished maintaining
profound silence waiting for the great roque guinart to speak he asked
the gentlemen who they were whither they were going and what money they
carried with them senor replied one of them we are two captains of
spanish infantry our companies are at naples and we are on our way to
embark in four galleys which they say are at barcelona under orders for
sicily and we have about two or three hundred crowns with which we are
according to our notions rich and contented for a soldiers poverty
roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains
and was answered that they were going to take ship for rome and that
between them they might have about sixty reals he asked also who was in
the coach whither they were bound and what money they had and one of
the men on horseback replied the persons in the coach are my lady dona
guiomar de quinones wife of the regent of the vicaria at naples her
little daughter a handmaid and a duenna we six servants are in
attendance upon her and the money amounts to six hundred crowns
so then said roque guinart we have got here nine hundred crowns and
sixty reals my soldiers must number some sixty see how much there falls
to each for i am a bad arithmetician as soon as the robbers heard this
they raised a shout of long life to roque guinart in spite of the
the captains showed plainly the concern they felt the regents lady was
downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property
confiscated roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while but he
had no desire to prolong their distress which might be seen a bowshot
off and turning to the captains he said sirs will your worships be
pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns and her ladyship the
regents wife eighty to satisfy this band that follows me for it is by
his singing the abbot gets his dinner and then you may at once proceed
on your journey free and unhindered with a safe conduct which i shall
give you so that if you come across any other bands of mine that i have
scattered in these parts they may do you no harm for i have no
intention of doing injury to soldiers or to any woman especially one of
profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the
captains thanked roque for his courtesy and generosity for such they
regarded his leaving them their own money senora dona guiomar de
quinones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and
hands of the great roque but he would not suffer it on any account so
far from that he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under
pressure of the inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling the
regents lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that
had been assessed as her share at once for the captains had already paid
down their sixty the pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their
little hoard but roque bade them keep quiet and turning to his men he
said of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over let
ten be given to these pilgrims and the other ten to this worthy squire
that he may be able to speak favourably of this adventure and then
having writing materials with which he always went provided brought to
him he gave them in writing a safe conduct to the leaders of his bands
and bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at
his magnanimity his generous disposition and his unusual conduct and
inclined to regard him as an alexander the great rather than a notorious
one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this
captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to
be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not
the unlucky wight did not speak so low but that roque overheard him and
drawing his sword almost split his head in two saying that is the way
i punish impudent saucy fellows they were all taken aback and not one
of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him roque
then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at
barcelona telling him that the famous don quixote of la mancha the
knight errant of whom there was so much talk was with him and was he
assured him the drollest and wisest man in the world and that in four
days from that date that is to say on saint john the baptists day he
was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse rocinante
together with his squire sancho on an ass in the middle of the strand of
the city and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the niarros
that they might divert themselves with him he wished he said his
enemies the cadells could be deprived of this pleasure but that was
impossible because the crazes and shrewd sayings of don quixote and the
humours of his squire sancho panza could not help giving general pleasure
to all the world he despatched the letter by one of his squires who
exchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant made his
way into barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed
of what happened don quixote on entering barcelona together with other
matters that partake of the true rather than of the ingenious
don quixote passed three days and three nights with roque and had he
passed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and
wonder at in his mode of life at daybreak they were in one spot at
dinner time in another sometimes they fled without knowing from whom at
other times they lay in wait not knowing for what they slept standing
breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place there was nothing
but sending out spies and scouts posting sentinels and blowing the
matches of harquebusses though they carried but few for almost all used
flintlocks roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from his
men that they might not know where he was for the many proclamations
the viceroy of barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and
uneasiness and he did not venture to trust anyone afraid that even his
own men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities of a truth
a weary miserable life at length by unfrequented roads short cuts and
secret paths roque don quixote and sancho together with six squires
set out for barcelona they reached the strand on saint johns eve during
the night and roque after embracing don quixote and sancho to whom he
presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then given
left them with many expressions of good will on both sides
roque went back while don quixote remained on horseback just as he was
waiting for day and it was not long before the countenance of the fair
aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east gladdening the
grass and flowers if not the ear though to gladden that too there came
at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums and a din of bells and
a tramp tramp and cries of clear the way there of some runners that
the dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler
began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon don quixote and
sancho gazed all round them they beheld the sea a sight until then
unseen by them it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad much
more so than the lakes of ruidera which they had seen in la mancha they
saw the galleys along the beach which lowering their awnings displayed
themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze
and kissed and swept the water while on board the bugles trumpets and
clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious
warlike notes then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish
upon the calm water while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and
in showy liveries issuing from the city engaged on their side in a
somewhat similar movement the soldiers on board the galleys kept up a
ceaseless fire which they on the walls and forts of the city returned
and the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made to
which the gangway guns of the galleys replied the bright sea the
smiling earth the clear air though at times darkened by the smoke of
the guns all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight
sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved
and now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and
outlandish cries and cheers to where don quixote stood amazed and
wondering and one of them he to whom roque had sent word addressing
him exclaimed welcome to our city mirror beacon star and cynosure of
all knight errantry in its widest extent welcome i say valiant don
quixote of la mancha not the false the fictitious the apocryphal that
these latter days have offered us in lying histories but the true the
legitimate the real one that cide hamete benengeli flower of
don quixote made no answer nor did the horsemen wait for one but
wheeling again with all their followers they began curvetting round don
quixote who turning to sancho said these gentlemen have plainly
recognised us i will wager they have read our history and even that
the cavalier who had addressed don quixote again approached him and said
come with us senor don quixote for we are all of us your servants and
great friends of roque guinarts to which don quixote returned if
courtesy breeds courtesy yours sir knight is daughter or very nearly
akin to the great roques carry me where you please i will have no will
but yours especially if you deign to employ it in your service
the cavalier replied with words no less polite and then all closing in
around him they set out with him for the city to the music of the
clarions and the drums as they were entering it the wicked one who is
the author of all mischief and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked
one contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins
should force their way through the crowd and lifting up one of them
dapples tail and the other rocinantes insert a bunch of furze under
each the poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish
by pressing their tails tight so much so that cutting a multitude of
capers they flung their masters to the ground don quixote covered with
shame and out of countenance ran to pluck the plume from his poor jades
tail while sancho did the same for dapple his conductors tried to
punish the audacity of the boys but there was no possibility of doing
so for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were
following them don quixote and sancho mounted once more and with the
same music and acclamations reached their conductors house which was
large and stately that of a rich gentleman in short and there for the
present we will leave them for such is cide hametes pleasure
which deals with the adventure of the enchanted head together with other
don quixotes host was one don antonio moreno by name a gentleman of
wealth and intelligence and very fond of diverting himself in any fair
and good natured way and having don quixote in his house he set about
devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless
fashion for jests that give pain are no jests and no sport is worth
anything if it hurts another the first thing he did was to make don
quixote take off his armour and lead him in that tight chamois suit we
have already described and depicted more than once out on a balcony
overhanging one of the chief streets of the city in full view of the
crowd and of the boys who gazed at him as they would at a monkey the
cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him
alone and not to enliven the festival of the day that they wore it and
sancho was in high delight for it seemed to him that how he knew not
he had fallen upon another camachos wedding another house like don
diego de mirandas another castle like the dukes some of don antonios
friends dined with him that day and all showed honour to don quixote and
treated him as a knight errant and he becoming puffed up and exalted in
consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction such were the
drolleries of sancho that all the servants of the house and all who
heard him were kept hanging upon his lips while at table don antonio
said to him we hear worthy sancho that you are so fond of manjar
blanco and forced meat balls that if you have any left you keep them in
no senor thats not true said sancho for i am more cleanly than
greedy and my master don quixote here knows well that we two are used to
live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts to be sure if it so
happens that they offer me a heifer i run with a halter i mean i eat
what im given and make use of opportunities as i find them but whoever
says that im an out of the way eater or not cleanly let me tell him
that he is wrong and id put it in a different way if i did not respect
the honourable beards that are at the table
indeed said don quixote sanchos moderation and cleanliness in
eating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass to be kept in
eternal remembrance in ages to come it is true that when he is hungry
there is a certain appearance of voracity about him for he eats at a
great pace and chews with both jaws but cleanliness he is always mindful
of and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily so much so
that he eats grapes and even pomegranate pips with a fork
what said don antonio has sancho been a governor
ay said sancho and of an island called barataria i governed it to
perfection for ten days and lost my rest all the time and learned to
look down upon all the governments in the world i got out of it by
taking to flight and fell into a pit where i gave myself up for dead
and out of which i escaped alive by a miracle
don quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of
sanchos government with which he greatly amused his hearers
on the cloth being removed don antonio taking don quixote by the hand
passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way
of furniture except a table apparently of jasper resting on a pedestal
of the same upon which was set up after the fashion of the busts of the
roman emperors a head which seemed to be of bronze don antonio
traversed the whole apartment with don quixote and walked round the table
several times and then said now senor don quixote that i am
satisfied that no one is listening to us and that the door is shut i
will tell you of one of the rarest adventures or more properly speaking
strange things that can be imagined on condition that you will keep
what i say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy
i swear it said don quixote and for greater security i will put a
flag stone over it for i would have you know senor don antonio he had
by this time learned his name that you are addressing one who though
he has ears to hear has no tongue to speak so that you may safely
transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine and rely upon it that
you have consigned it to the depths of silence
in reliance upon that promise said don antonio i will astonish you
with what you shall see and hear and relieve myself of some of the
vexation it gives me to have no one to whom i can confide my secrets for
they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody
don quixote was puzzled wondering what could be the object of such
precautions whereupon don antonio taking his hand passed it over the
bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it
stood and then said this head senor don quixote has been made and
fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever
saw a pole i believe by birth and a pupil of the famous escotillo of
whom such marvellous stories are told he was here in my house and for a
consideration of a thousand crowns that i gave him he constructed this
head which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions
are put to its ear he observed the points of the compass he traced
figures he studied the stars he watched favourable moments and at
length brought it to the perfection we shall see to morrow for on
fridays it is mute and this being friday we must wait till the next day
in the interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it
and i know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth
don quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head and was
inclined to disbelieve don antonio but seeing what a short time he had
to wait to test the matter he did not choose to say anything except that
he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret they then
quitted the room don antonio locked the door and they repaired to the
chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled in the meantime
sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that
that afternoon they took don quixote out for a stroll not in his armour
but in street costume with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him that at
that season would have made ice itself sweat orders were left with the
servants to entertain sancho so as not to let him leave the house don
quixote was mounted not on rocinante but upon a tall mule of easy pace
and handsomely caparisoned they put the surcoat on him and on the back
without his perceiving it they stitched a parchment on which they wrote
in large letters this is don quixote of la mancha as they set out
upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to
see him and as they read out this is don quixote of la mancha don
quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him called him by his
name and recognised him and turning to don antonio who rode at his
side he observed to him great are the privileges knight errantry
involves for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every
region of the earth see don antonio even the very boys of this city
true senor don quixote returned don antonio for as fire cannot be
hidden or kept secret virtue cannot escape being recognised and that
which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above
it came to pass however that as don quixote was proceeding amid the
acclamations that have been described a castilian reading the
inscription on his back cried out in a loud voice the devil take thee
for a don quixote of la mancha what art thou here and not dead of the
countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs thou art mad and if
thou wert so by thyself and kept thyself within thy madness it would
not be so bad but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of
all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee why look at these
gentlemen bearing thee company get thee home blockhead and see after
thy affairs and thy wife and children and give over these fooleries
that are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits
go your own way brother said don antonio and dont offer advice to
those who dont ask you for it senor don quixote is in his full senses
and we who bear him company are not fools virtue is to be honoured
wherever it may be found go and bad luck to you and dont meddle where
by god your worship is right replied the castilian for to advise
this good man is to kick against the pricks still for all that it fills
me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in everything
should dribble away by the channel of his knight errantry but may the
bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my descendants if from
this day forth though i should live longer than methuselah i ever give
advice to anybody even if he asks me for it
the advice giver took himself off and they continued their stroll but
so great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard that
don antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something
night came and they went home and there was a ladies dancing party for
don antonios wife a lady of rank and gaiety beauty and wit had
invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and amuse
themselves with his strange delusions several of them came they supped
sumptuously the dance began at about ten oclock among the ladies were
two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn and though perfectly modest
somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion sake these two
were so indefatigable in taking don quixote out to dance that they tired
him down not only in body but in spirit it was a sight to see the
figure don quixote made long lank lean and yellow his garments
clinging tight to him ungainly and above all anything but agile
the gay ladies made secret love to him and he on his part secretly
repelled them but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he
lifted up his voice and exclaimed fugite partes adversae leave me in
peace unwelcome overtures avaunt with your desires ladies for she
who is queen of mine the peerless dulcinea del toboso suffers none but
hers to lead me captive and subdue me and so saying he sat down on the
floor in the middle of the room tired out and broken down by all this
don antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed and
the first that laid hold of him was sancho saying as he did so in an
evil hour you took to dancing master mine do you fancy all mighty men
of valour are dancers and all knights errant given to capering if you
do i can tell you you are mistaken theres many a man would rather
undertake to kill a giant than cut a caper if it had been the shoe fling
you were at i could take your place for i can do the shoe fling like a
with these and other observations sancho set the whole ball room
laughing and then put his master to bed covering him up well so that he
might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing
the next day don antonio thought he might as well make trial of the
enchanted head and with don quixote sancho and two others friends of
his besides the two ladies that had tired out don quixote at the ball
who had remained for the night with don antonios wife he locked himself
up in the chamber where the head was he explained to them the property
it possessed and entrusted the secret to them telling them that now for
the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head but
except don antonios two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of
the enchantment and if don antonio had not first revealed it to them
they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as
the rest so artfully and skilfully was it contrived
the first to approach the ear of the head was don antonio himself and in
a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all he said to it
head tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am i at this moment
the head without any movement of the lips answered in a clear and
distinct voice so as to be heard by all i cannot judge of thoughts
all were thunderstruck at this and all the more so as they saw that
there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could
have answered how many of us are here asked don antonio once more
and it was answered him in the same way softly thou and thy wife with
two friends of thine and two of hers and a famous knight called don
quixote of la mancha and a squire of his sancho panza by name
now there was fresh astonishment now everyones hair was standing on end
with awe and don antonio retiring from the head exclaimed this
suffices to show me that i have not been deceived by him who sold thee to
me o sage head talking head answering head wonderful head let some
one else go and put what question he likes to it
and as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive the first to come
forward was one of the two friends of don antonios wife and her
question was tell me head what shall i do to be very beautiful and
the answer she got was be very modest
i question thee no further said the fair querist
her companion then came up and said i should like to know head
whether my husband loves me or not the answer given to her was think
how he uses thee and thou mayest guess and the married lady went off
saying that answer did not need a question for of course the treatment
one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is received
then one of don antonios two friends advanced and asked it who am i
thou knowest was the answer that is not what i ask thee said the
gentleman but to tell me if thou knowest me yes i know thee thou
i do not seek to know more said the gentleman for this is enough to
convince me o head that thou knowest everything and as he retired the
other friend came forward and asked it tell me head what are the
i have said already was the answer that i cannot judge of wishes
however i can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee
thats what i see with my eyes i point out with my finger said the
don antonios wife came up and said i know not what to ask thee head
i would only seek to know of thee if i shall have many years of enjoyment
of my good husband and the answer she received was thou shalt for
his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of life which by
then don quixote came forward and said tell me thou that answerest
was that which i describe as having happened to me in the cave of
montesinos the truth or a dream will sanchos whipping be accomplished
without fail will the disenchantment of dulcinea be brought about
as to the question of the cave was the reply there is much to be
said there is something of both in it sanchos whipping will proceed
leisurely the disenchantment of dulcinea will attain its due
i seek to know no more said don quixote let me but see dulcinea
disenchanted and i will consider that all the good fortune i could wish
for has come upon me all at once
the last questioner was sancho and his questions were head shall i by
any chance have another government shall i ever escape from the hard
life of a squire shall i get back to see my wife and children to which
the answer came thou shalt govern in thy house and if thou returnest
to it thou shalt see thy wife and children and on ceasing to serve thou
good by god said sancho panza i could have told myself that the
what answer wouldst thou have beast said don quixote is it not
enough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to
yes it is enough said sancho but i should have liked it to have
the questions and answers came to an end here but not the wonder with
which all were filled except don antonios two friends who were in the
secret this cide hamete benengeli thought fit to reveal at once not to
keep the world in suspense fancying that the head had some strange
magical mystery in it he says therefore that on the model of another
head the work of an image maker which he had seen at madrid don
antonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish
ignorant people and its mechanism was as follows the table was of wood
painted and varnished to imitate jasper and the pedestal on which it
stood was of the same material with four eagles claws projecting from
it to support the weight more steadily the head which resembled a bust
or figure of a roman emperor and was coloured like bronze was hollow
throughout as was the table into which it was fitted so exactly that no
trace of the joining was visible the pedestal of the table was also
hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head and the
whole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber in
which the head stood through the entire cavity in the pedestal table
throat and neck of the bust or figure there passed a tube of tin
carefully adjusted and concealed from sight in the room below
corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer
with his mouth to the tube and the voice as in an ear trumpet passed
from above downwards and from below upwards the words coming clearly
and distinctly it was impossible thus to detect the trick a nephew of
don antonios a smart sharp witted student was the answerer and as he
had been told beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would
come with him that day into the chamber where the head was it was an
easy matter for him to answer the first question at once and correctly
the others he answered by guess work and being clever cleverly cide
hamete adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve
days but that as it became noised abroad through the city that he had
in his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of
it don antonio fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful
sentinels of our faith explained the matter to the inquisitors who
commanded him to break it up and have done with it lest the ignorant
vulgar should be scandalised by don quixote however and by sancho the
head was still held to be an enchanted one and capable of answering
questions though more to don quixotes satisfaction than sanchos
the gentlemen of the city to gratify don antonio and also to do the
