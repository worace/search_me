the governor at my request gave the sign for csar and brutus to
advance towards us i was struck with a profound veneration at the sight
of brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue the
greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of his
country and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of his
countenance i observed with much pleasure that these two persons were
in good intelligence with each other and csar freely confessed to me
that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by many
degrees to the glory of taking it away i had the honour to have much
conversation with brutus and was told that his ancestor junius
socrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himself
were perpetually together a sextumvirate to which all the ages of the
it would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers
of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire i
had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me i
chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and
usurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations
but it is impossible to express the satisfaction i received in my own
mind after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the
a further account of glubbdubdrib ancient and modern history corrected
having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and
learning i set apart one day on purpose i proposed that homer and
aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but these
were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court
and outward rooms of the palace i knew and could distinguish those two
heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other
homer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect
for one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i ever
beheld aristotle stooped much and made use of a staff his visage was
meagre his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow i soon discovered
that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company and
had never seen or heard of them before and i had a whisper from a ghost
who shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the most
distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through a
consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly
misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity i introduced
didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them
better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a genius
to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotle was out of all
patience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presented
them to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as
i then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whom
i prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle this great
philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy
because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must do
and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus as
palatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally to be
exploded he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof the
present learned are such zealous asserters he said that new systems
of nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and even
those who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles
would flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogue when that
i spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned
i saw most of the first roman emperors i prevailed on the governor to
call up heliogabaluss cooks to dress us a dinner but they could not
show us much of their skill for want of materials a helot of agesilaus
made us a dish of spartan broth but i was not able to get down a second
the two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their
private affairs to return in three days which i employed in seeing some
of the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or three
hundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and having
been always a great admirer of old illustrious families i desired the
governor would call up a dozen or two of kings with their ancestors in
order for eight or nine generations but my disappointment was grievous
and unexpected for instead of a long train with royal diadems i saw
in one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italian
prelate in another a barber an abbot and two cardinals i have too
great a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice a
subject but as to counts marquises dukes earls and the like i was
not so scrupulous and i confess it was not without some pleasure that
i found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain
families are distinguished up to their originals i could plainly
discover whence one family derives a long chin why a second has abounded
with knaves for two generations and fools for two more why a third
happened to be crack brained and a fourth to be sharpers whence it
came what polydore virgil says of a certain great house nec vir
fortis nec foemina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grew
to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much
as by their coats of arms who first brought the pox into a noble house
which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity
neither could i wonder at all this when i saw such an interruption of
lineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters fiddlers
i was chiefly disgusted with modern history for having strictly
examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for a
hundred years past i found how the world had been misled by prostitute
writers to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisest
counsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayers
of their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites truth to
informers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to
death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the
corruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains had
been exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profit
how great a share in the motions and events of courts councils and
senates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites and
buffoons how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integrity when i
was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and
revolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which they
here i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write
anecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves with
a cup of poison will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief
minister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets of
ambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortune
to be mistaken here i discovered the true causes of many great events
that have surprised the world how a whore can govern the back stairs
the back stairs a council and the council a senate a general
confessed in my presence that he got a victory purely by the force of
cowardice and ill conduct and an admiral that for want of proper
intelligence he beat the enemy to whom he intended to betray the
fleet three kings protested to me that in their whole reigns they
never did once prefer any person of merit unless by mistake or
treachery of some minister in whom they confided neither would they do
it if they were to live again and they showed with great strength of
reason that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption
because that positive confident restiff temper which virtue infused
into a man was a perpetual clog to public business
i had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner by what methods
great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour and
prodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very modern period
however without grating upon present times because i would be sure to
give no offence even to foreigners for i hope the reader need not be
told that i do not in the least intend my own country in what i say
upon this occasion a great number of persons concerned were called up
and upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy
that i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness perjury
oppression subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities were
among the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gave
as it was reasonable great allowance but when some confessed they owed
their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to the
prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying
of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the
perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent i hope i may be
pardoned if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that
profound veneration which i am naturally apt to pay to persons of high
rank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their
i had often read of some great services done to princes and states and
desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed upon
inquiry i was told that their names were to be found on no record
except a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest of
rogues and traitors as to the rest i had never once heard of them
they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most of
them telling me they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on a
among others there was one person whose case appeared a little
singular he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side
he told me he had for many years been commander of a ship and in the
sea fight at actium had the good fortune to break through the enemys
great line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take a
fourth which was the sole cause of antonys flight and of the victory
that ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed in
the action he added that upon the confidence of some merit the war
being at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustus
to be preferred to a greater ship whose commander had been killed but
without any regard to his pretensions it was given to a boy who had
never seen the sea the son of libertina who waited on one of the
emperors mistresses returning back to his own vessel he was charged
with neglect of duty and the ship given to a favourite page of
publicola the vice admiral whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a
great distance from rome and there ended his life i was so curious to
know the truth of this story that i desired agrippa might be called who
was admiral in that fight he appeared and confirmed the whole account
but with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuated
or concealed a great part of his merit
i was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that
empire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me less
wonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of all
kinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well as
pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had the
as every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in
the world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race
of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past
how the pox under all its consequences and denominations had altered
every lineament of an english countenance shortened the size of bodies
unbraced the nerves relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced a sallow
complexion and rendered the flesh loose and rancid
i descended so low as to desire some english yeoman of the old stamp
might be summoned to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their
manners diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true
spirit of liberty for their valour and love of their country neither
could i be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead when
i considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a
piece of money by their grand children who in selling their votes and
managing at elections have acquired every vice and corruption that can
the author returns to maldonada sails to the kingdom of luggnagg the
author confined he is sent for to court the manner of his admittance
the day of our departure being come i took leave of his highness the
governor of glubbdubdrib and returned with my two companions to
maldonada where after a fortnights waiting a ship was ready to sail
for luggnagg the two gentlemen and some others were so generous and
kind as to furnish me with provisions and see me on board i was a
month in this voyage we had one violent storm and were under a
necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind which holds
for above sixty leagues on the 21st of april 1708 we sailed into the
river of clumegnig which is a seaport town at the south east point of
luggnagg we cast anchor within a league of the town and made a signal
for a pilot two of them came on board in less than half an hour by
whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very
dangerous in the passage to a large basin where a fleet may ride in
safety within a cables length of the town wall
some of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence had
informed the pilots that i was a stranger and great traveller whereof
these gave notice to a custom house officer by whom i was examined very
strictly upon my landing this officer spoke to me in the language of
balnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understood
in that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs i
gave him a short account of some particulars and made my story as
plausible and consistent as i could but i thought it necessary to
disguise my country and call myself a hollander because my intentions
were for japan and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to
enter into that kingdom i therefore told the officer that having been
shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on a rock i was
received up into laputa or the flying island of which he had often
heard and was now endeavouring to get to japan whence i might find a
convenience of returning to my own country the officer said i must
be confined till he could receive orders from court for which he would
write immediately and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight i was
carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door
however i had the liberty of a large garden and was treated with
humanity enough being maintained all the time at the kings charge i
was invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was
reported that i came from countries very remote of which they had never
i hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter he
was a native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and was
a perfect master of both languages by his assistance i was able to
hold a conversation with those who came to visit me but this consisted
the despatch came from court about the time we expected it contained a
warrant for conducting me and my retinue to traldragdubh or
trildrogdrib for it is pronounced both ways as near as i can
remember by a party of ten horse all my retinue was that poor lad for
an interpreter whom i persuaded into my service and at my humble
request we had each of us a mule to ride on a messenger was despatched
half a days journey before us to give the king notice of my approach
and to desire that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour
when it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour to
lick the dust before his footstool this is the court style and i
found it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two days
after my arrival i was commanded to crawl upon my belly and lick the
floor as i advanced but on account of my being a stranger care was
taken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensive
however this was a peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of the
highest rank when they desire an admittance nay sometimes the floor
is strewed with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happens
to have powerful enemies at court and i have seen a great lord with his
mouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from the
throne he was not able to speak a word neither is there any remedy
because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe
their mouths in his majestys presence there is indeed another custom
which i cannot altogether approve of when the king has a mind to put any
of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner he commands the
floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition
which being licked up infallibly kills him in twenty four hours but in
justice to this princes great clemency and the care he has of his
subjects lives wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of
europe would imitate him it must be mentioned for his honour that
strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well
washed after every such execution which if his domestics neglect they
are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure i myself heard him
give directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn it
was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution but
maliciously had omitted it by which neglect a young lord of great hopes
coming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king at
that time had no design against his life but this good prince was so
gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that he
would do so no more without special orders
to return from this digression when i had crept within four yards of
the throne i raised myself gently upon my knees and then striking my
forehead seven times against the ground i pronounced the following
words as they had been taught me the night before inckpling
gurdlubh asht this is the compliment established by the laws of the
land for all persons admitted to the kings presence it may be
rendered into english thus may your celestial majesty outlive the sun
eleven moons and a half to this the king returned some answer which
although i could not understand yet i replied as i had been directed
fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush which properly signifies
my tongue is in the mouth of my friend and by this expression was
meant that i desired leave to bring my interpreter whereupon the young
man already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention i
answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour i
spoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaning
the king was much delighted with my company and ordered his
bliffmarklub or high chamberlain to appoint a lodging in the court
for me and my interpreter with a daily allowance for my table and a
large purse of gold for my common expenses
i staid three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his
majesty who was pleased highly to favour me and made me very honourable
offers but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to
pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family
the luggnaggians commended a particular description of the struldbrugs
with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon
the luggnaggians are a polite and generous people and although they are
not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all eastern
countries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especially
such who are countenanced by the court i had many acquaintance and
among persons of the best fashion and being always attended by my
interpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeable
one day in much good company i was asked by a person of quality
whether i had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals i said
i had not and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an
appellation applied to a mortal creature he told me that sometimes
though very rarely a child happened to be born in a family with a red
circular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which was
an infallible mark that it should never die the spot as he described
it was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course of
time grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old it
became green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deep
blue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an english
shilling but never admitted any further alteration he said these
births were so rare that he did not believe there could be above eleven
hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which he
computed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest a young girl
born about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar to
any family but a mere effect of chance and the children of the
struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the
i freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight upon
hearing this account and the person who gave it me happening to
understand the balnibarbian language which i spoke very well i could
not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too
extravagant i cried out as in a rapture happy nation where every
child hath at least a chance for being immortal happy people who enjoy
so many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready to
instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond all
comparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exempt
from that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free and
disengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the
continual apprehensions of death i discovered my admiration that i had
not observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black spot on
the forehead being so remarkable a distinction that i could not have
easily overlooked it and it was impossible that his majesty a most
judicious prince should not provide himself with a good number of such
wise and able counsellors yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend
sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court
and we often find by experience that young men are too opinionated and
volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors however
since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person i was
resolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on
this matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter and
whether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing i was
determined that his majesty having frequently offered me an
establishment in this country i would with great thankfulness accept
the favour and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior
beings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit me
the gentleman to whom i addressed my discourse because as i have
already observed he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with a
sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant that he
was glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permission
to explain to the company what i had spoke he did so and they talked
together for some time in their own language whereof i understood not a
syllable neither could i observe by their countenances what impression
my discourse had made on them after a short silence the same person
told me that his friends and mine so he thought fit to express
himself were very much pleased with the judicious remarks i had made on
the great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they were
desirous to know in a particular manner what scheme of living i should
have formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a
i answered it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a
subject especially to me who had been often apt to amuse myself with
visions of what i should do if i were a king a general or a great
lord and upon this very case i had frequently run over the whole system
how i should employ myself and pass the time if i were sure to live for
that if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a
struldbrug as soon as i could discover my own happiness by
understanding the difference between life and death i would first
resolve by all arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches
in the pursuit of which by thrift and management i might reasonably
expect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the
kingdom in the second place i would from my earliest youth apply
myself to the study of arts and sciences by which i should arrive in
time to excel all others in learning lastly i would carefully record
every action and event of consequence that happened in the public
impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and
great ministers of state with my own observations on every point i
would exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashions
of dress diet and diversions by all which acquirements i should be a
living treasure of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracle
i would never marry after threescore but live in a hospitable manner
yet still on the saving side i would entertain myself in forming and
directing the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my own
remembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examples
of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life but my choice
and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood
among whom i would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my own
contemporaries where any of these wanted fortunes i would provide them
with convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them always
at my table only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals
whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance
and treat your posterity after the same manner just as a man diverts
himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden
without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year
these struldbrugs and i would mutually communicate our observations
and memorials through the course of time remark the several gradations
by which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every step
by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added to
the strong influence of our own example would probably prevent that
continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages
add to this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states
and empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities in
ruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous rivers
lessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry and
overwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknown
barbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous become
civilized i should then see the discovery of the longitude the
perpetual motion the universal medicine and many other great
what wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving and
confirming our own predictions by observing the progress and return of
comets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and stars
i enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless
life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with when i had
ended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before to
the rest of the company there was a good deal of talk among them in the
language of the country not without some laughter at my expense at
last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he was
desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes which i had fallen
into through the common imbecility of human nature and upon that
allowance was less answerable for them that this breed of struldbrugs
was peculiar to their country for there were no such people either in
balnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from his
majesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to
believe that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishment
when he first mentioned the matter to me that i received it as a thing
wholly new and scarcely to be credited that in the two kingdoms above
mentioned where during his residence he had conversed very much he
observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind that
whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as
strongly as he could that the oldest had still hopes of living one day
longer and looked on death as the greatest evil from which nature
always prompted him to retreat only in this island of luggnagg the
appetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of the
that the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust
because it supposed a perpetuity of youth health and vigour which no
man could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in his
wishes that the question therefore was not whether a man would choose
to be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and health
but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages
which old age brings along with it for although few men will avow their
desires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the two
kingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed that
every man desired to put off death some time longer let it approach ever
so late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except he
were incited by the extremity of grief or torture and he appealed to
me whether in those countries i had travelled as well as my own i had
after this preface he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugs
among them he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty
years old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected
increasing in both till they came to fourscore this he learned from
their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or three
of that species born in an age they were too few to form a general
observation by when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned the
extremity of living in this country they had not only all the follies
and infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from the
dreadful prospect of never dying they were not only opinionative
peevish covetous morose vain talkative but incapable of friendship
and dead to all natural affection which never descended below their
grandchildren envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions
but those objects against which their envy seems principally directed
are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old by
reflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from all
possibility of pleasure and whenever they see a funeral they lament and
repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they
themselves never can hope to arrive they have no remembrance of
anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and
middle age and even that is very imperfect and for the truth or
particulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common tradition than
upon their best recollections the least miserable among them appear to
be those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet
with more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities which
if a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage is
dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as the
younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it a
reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault of
their own to a perpetual continuance in the world should not have their
misery doubled by the load of a wife
as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are looked
on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates only
a small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones are
maintained at the public charge after that period they are held
incapable of any employment of trust or profit they cannot purchase
lands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any
cause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers and
at ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age no
distinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get without
relish or appetite the diseases they were subject to still continue
without increasing or diminishing in talking they forget the common
appellation of things and the names of persons even of those who are
their nearest friends and relations for the same reason they never can
amuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve to
carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end and by this
defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might
the language of this country being always upon the flux the
struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither are
they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation farther
than by a few general words with their neighbours the mortals and thus
they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own
this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i can
remember i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngest
not above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several times
by some of my friends but although they were told that i was a great
traveller and had seen all the world they had not the least curiosity
to ask me a question only desired i would give them slumskudask or
a token of remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid the
law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by the
public although indeed with a very scanty allowance
they are despised and hated by all sorts of people when one of them is
born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded very
particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register
which however has not been kept above a thousand years past or at
least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances but the usual
way of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or great
persons they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly
the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were
they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld and the women more
horrible than the men besides the usual deformities in extreme old age
they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number of
years which is not to be described and among half a dozen i soon
distinguished which was the eldest although there was not above a
the reader will easily believe that from what i had hear and seen my
keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated i grew heartily
ashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed and thought no tyrant could
invent a death into which i would not run with pleasure from such a
life the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends
upon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing i could send
a couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people against
the fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental
laws of the kingdom or else i should have been well content with the
i could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the
struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any
other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like
circumstances otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of old
age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole
nation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities to
manage must end in the ruin of the public
the author leaves luggnagg and sails to japan from thence he returns
in a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to england
i thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainment
to the reader because it seems to be a little out of the common way at
least i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that
has come to my hands and if i am deceived my excuse must be that it is
necessary for travellers who describe the same country very often to
agree in dwelling on the same particulars without deserving the censure
of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them
there is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great
empire of japan and it is very probable that the japanese authors may
have given some account of the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was so
short and i was so entirely a stranger to the language that i was not
qualified to make any inquiries but i hope the dutch upon this notice
will be curious and able enough to supply my defects
his majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his
court and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native
country was pleased to give me his license to depart and honoured me
with a letter of recommendation under his own hand to the emperor of
japan he likewise presented me with four hundred and forty four large
pieces of gold this nation delighting in even numbers and a red
diamond which i sold in england for eleven hundred pounds
on the 6th of may 1709 i took a solemn leave of his majesty and all my
friends this prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me
to glanguenstald which is a royal port to the south west part of the
island in six days i found a vessel ready to carry me to japan and
spent fifteen days in the voyage we landed at a small port town called
xamoschi situated on the south east part of japan the town lies on the
western point where there is a narrow strait leading northward into
along arm of the sea upon the north west part of which yedo the
metropolis stands at landing i showed the custom house officers my
letter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty they knew the
seal perfectly well it was as broad as the palm of my hand the
impression was a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth the
magistrates of the town hearing of my letter received me as a public
minister they provided me with carriages and servants and bore my
charges to yedo where i was admitted to an audience and delivered my
letter which was opened with great ceremony and explained to the
emperor by an interpreter who then gave me notice by his majestys
order that i should signify my request and whatever it were it
should be granted for the sake of his royal brother of luggnagg this
interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the
hollanders he soon conjectured by my countenance that i was a
european and therefore repeated his majestys commands in low dutch
which he spoke perfectly well i answered as i had before determined
that i was a dutch merchant shipwrecked in a very remote country
whence i had travelled by sea and land to luggnagg and then took
shipping for japan where i knew my countrymen often traded and with
some of these i hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe i
therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour to give order that i
should be conducted in safety to nangasac to this i added another
petition that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg his
majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on
my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix because i had been thrown
into his kingdom by my misfortunes without any intention of trading
when this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor he seemed a
little surprised and said he believed i was the first of my countrymen
who ever made any scruple in this point and that he began to doubt
whether i was a real hollander or not but rather suspected i must be a
christian however for the reasons i had offered but chiefly to
gratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour he would
comply with the singularity of my humour but the affair must be managed
with dexterity and his officers should be commanded to let me pass as
it were by forgetfulness for he assured me that if the secret should
be discovered by my countrymen the dutch they would cut my throat in the
voyage i returned my thanks by the interpreter for so unusual a
favour and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasac
the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither with
particular instructions about the business of the crucifix
on the 9th day of june 1709 i arrived at nangasac after a very long
and troublesome journey i soon fell into the company of some dutch
sailors belonging to the amboyna of amsterdam a stout ship of 450 tons
i had lived long in holland pursuing my studies at leyden and i spoke
dutch well the seamen soon knew whence i came last they were curious
to inquire into my voyages and course of life i made up a story as
short and probable as i could but concealed the greatest part i knew
many persons in holland i was able to invent names for my parents whom
i pretended to be obscure people in the province of gelderland i would
have given the captain one theodorus vangrult what he pleased to ask
for my voyage to holland but understanding i was a surgeon he was
contented to take half the usual rate on condition that i would serve
him in the way of my calling before we took shipping i was often asked
by some of the crew whether i had performed the ceremony above
mentioned i evaded the question by general answers that i had
satisfied the emperor and court in all particulars however a
malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer and pointing to me told
him i had not yet trampled on the crucifix but the other who had
received instructions to let me pass gave the rascal twenty strokes on
the shoulders with a bamboo after which i was no more troubled with such
nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage we sailed with a fair
wind to the cape of good hope where we staid only to take in fresh
water on the 10th of april 1710 we arrived safe at amsterdam having
lost only three men by sickness in the voyage and a fourth who fell
from the foremast into the sea not far from the coast of guinea from
amsterdam i soon after set sail for england in a small vessel belonging
on the 16th of april we put in at the downs i landed next morning and
saw once more my native country after an absence of five years and six
months complete i went straight to redriff where i arrived the same
day at two in the afternoon and found my wife and family in good health
part iv a voyage to the country of the houyhnhnms
the author sets out as captain of a ship his men conspire against him
confine him a long time to his cabin and set him on shore in an unknown
land he travels up into the country the yahoos a strange sort of
i continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a
very happy condition if i could have learned the lesson of knowing when
i was well i left my poor wife big with child and accepted an
advantageous offer made me to be captain of the adventurer a stout
merchantman of 350 tons for i understood navigation well and being
grown weary of a surgeons employment at sea which however i could
exercise upon occasion i took a skilful young man of that calling one
robert purefoy into my ship we set sail from portsmouth upon the 7th
day of september 1710 on the 14th we met with captain pocock of
bristol at teneriffe who was going to the bay of campechy to cut
logwood on the 16th he was parted from us by a storm i heard since my
return that his ship foundered and none escaped but one cabin boy he
was an honest man and a good sailor but a little too positive in his
own opinions which was the cause of his destruction as it has been with
several others for if he had followed my advice he might have been safe
at home with his family at this time as well as myself
i had several men who died in my ship of calentures so that i was forced
to get recruits out of barbadoes and the leeward islands where i
touched by the direction of the merchants who employed me which i had
soon too much cause to repent for i found afterwards that most of them
had been buccaneers i had fifty hands onboard and my orders were that
i should trade with the indians in the south sea and make what
discoveries i could these rogues whom i had picked up debauched my
other men and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship and secure
me which they did one morning rushing into my cabin and binding me
hand and foot threatening to throw me overboard if i offered to stir
i told them i was their prisoner and would submit this they made me
swear to do and then they unbound me only fastening one of my legs with
a chain near my bed and placed a sentry at my door with his piece
charged who was commanded to shoot me dead if i attempted my liberty
they sent me own victuals and drink and took the government of the ship
to themselves their design was to turn pirates and plunder the
spaniards which they could not do till they got more men but first
they resolved to sell the goods the ship and then go to madagascar for
recruits several among them having died since my confinement they
sailed many weeks and traded with the indians but i knew not what
course they took being kept a close prisoner in my cabin and expecting
nothing less than to be murdered as they often threatened me
upon the 9th day of may 1711 one james welch came down to my cabin and
said he had orders from the captain to set me ashore i expostulated
with him but in vain neither would he so much as tell me who their new
captain was they forced me into the long boat letting me put on my
best suit of clothes which were as good as new and take a small bundle
of linen but no arms except my hanger and they were so civil as not to
search my pockets into which i conveyed what money i had with some
other little necessaries they rowed about a league and then set me
down on a strand i desired them to tell me what country it was they
all swore they knew no more than myself but said that the captain
as they called him was resolved after they had sold the lading to
get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land they
pushed off immediately advising me to make haste for fear of being
overtaken by the tide and so bade me farewell
in this desolate condition i advanced forward and soon got upon firm
ground where i sat down on a bank to rest myself and consider what i
had best do when i was a little refreshed i went up into the country
resolving to deliver myself to the first savages i should meet and
purchase my life from them by some bracelets glass rings and other
toys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages and
whereof i had some about me the land was divided by long rows of trees
not regularly planted but naturally growing there was great plenty of
grass and several fields of oats i walked very circumspectly for fear
of being surprised or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or on
either side i fell into a beaten road where i saw many tracts of human
feet and some of cows but most of horses at last i beheld several
animals in a field and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees
their shape was very singular and deformed which a little discomposed
me so that i lay down behind a thicket to observe them better some of
them coming forward near the place where i lay gave me an opportunity of
distinctly marking their form their heads and breasts were covered with
a thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like goats
and a long ridge of hair down their backs and the fore parts of their
legs and feet but the rest of their bodies was bare so that i might see
their skins which were of a brown buff colour they had no tails nor
any hair at all on their buttocks except about the anus which i
presume nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the
ground for this posture they used as well as lying down and often
stood on their hind feet they climbed high trees as nimbly as a
squirrel for they had strong extended claws before and behind
terminating in sharp points and hooked they would often spring and
bound and leap with prodigious agility the females were not so large
as the males they had long lank hair on their heads but none on their
faces nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their
bodies except about the anus and pudenda the dugs hung between their
fore feet and often reached almost to the ground as they walked the
hair of both sexes was of several colours brown red black and yellow
upon the whole i never beheld in all my travels so disagreeable an
animal or one against which i naturally conceived so strong an
antipathy so that thinking i had seen enough full of contempt and
aversion i got up and pursued the beaten road hoping it might direct
me to the cabin of some indian i had not got far when i met one of
these creatures full in my way and coming up directly to me the ugly
monster when he saw me distorted several ways every feature of his
visage and stared as at an object he had never seen before then
approaching nearer lifted up his fore paw whether out of curiosity or
mischief i could not tell but i drew my hanger and gave him a good blow
with the flat side of it for i durst not strike with the edge fearing
the inhabitants might be provoked against me if they should come to know
that i had killed or maimed any of their cattle when the beast felt the
smart he drew back and roared so loud that a herd of at least forty
came flocking about me from the next field howling and making odious
faces but i ran to the body of a tree and leaning my back against it
kept them off by waving my hanger several of this cursed brood getting
hold of the branches behind leaped up into the tree whence they began
to discharge their excrements on my head however i escaped pretty well
by sticking close to the stem of the tree but was almost stifled with
the filth which fell about me on every side
in the midst of this distress i observed them all to run away on a
sudden as fast as they could at which i ventured to leave the tree and
pursue the road wondering what it was that could put them into this
fright but looking on my left hand i saw a horse walking softly in the
field which my persecutors having sooner discovered was the cause of
their flight the horse started a little when he came near me but soon
recovering himself looked full in my face with manifest tokens of
wonder he viewed my hands and feet walking round me several times i
would have pursued my journey but he placed himself directly in the way
yet looking with a very mild aspect never offering the least violence
we stood gazing at each other for some time at last i took the boldness
to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it using the
common style and whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle a
strange horse but this animal seemed to receive my civilities with
disdain shook his head and bent his brows softly raising up his right
fore foot to remove my hand then he neighed three or four times but in
so different a cadence that i almost began to think he was speaking to
while he and i were thus employed another horse came up who applying
himself to the first in a very formal manner they gently struck each
others right hoof before neighing several times by turns and varying
the sound which seemed to be almost articulate they went some paces
off as if it were to confer together walking side by side backward and
forward like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight but often
turning their eyes towards me as it were to watch that i might not
escape i was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts
and concluded with myself that if the inhabitants of this country were
endued with a proportionable degree of reason they must needs be the
wisest people upon earth this thought gave me so much comfort that i
resolved to go forward until i could discover some house or village or
meet with any of the natives leaving the two horses to discourse
together as they pleased but the first who was a dapple gray
observing me to steal off neighed after me in so expressive a tone that
i fancied myself to understand what he meant whereupon i turned back
and came near to him to expect his farther commands but concealing my
fear as much as i could for i began to be in some pain how this
adventure might terminate and the reader will easily believe i did not
the two horses came up close to me looking with great earnestness upon
my face and hands the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right
fore hoof and discomposed it so much that i was forced to adjust it
better by taking it off and settling it again whereat both he and his
companion who was a brown bay appeared to be much surprised the latter
felt the lappet of my coat and finding it to hang loose about me they
both looked with new signs of wonder he stroked my right hand seeming
to admire the softness and colour but he squeezed it so hard between his
hoof and his pastern that i was forced to roar after which they both
touched me with all possible tenderness they were under great
perplexity about my shoes and stockings which they felt very often
neighing to each other and using various gestures not unlike those of a
philosopher when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult
upon the whole the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and
rational so acute and judicious that i at last concluded they must
needs be magicians who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some
design and seeing a stranger in the way resolved to divert themselves
with him or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a man so very
different in habit feature and complexion from those who might
probably live in so remote a climate upon the strength of this
reasoning i ventured to address them in the following manner
gentlemen if you be conjurers as i have good cause to believe you can
understand my language therefore i make bold to let your worships know
that i am a poor distressed englishman driven by his misfortunes upon
your coast and i entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back as if
he were a real horse to some house or village where i can be relieved
in return of which favour i will make you a present of this knife and
bracelet taking them out of my pocket the two creatures stood silent
while i spoke seeming to listen with great attention and when i had
ended they neighed frequently towards each other as if they were
engaged in serious conversation i plainly observed that their language
expressed the passions very well and the words might with little pains
be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinese
i could frequently distinguish the word yahoo which was repeated by
each of them several times and although it was impossible for me to
conjecture what it meant yet while the two horses were busy in
conversation i endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue and as
soon as they were silent i boldly pronounced yahoo in a loud voice
imitating at the same time as near as i could the neighing of a horse
at which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the same
word twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein i spoke
after him as well as i could and found myself perceivably to improve
every time though very far from any degree of perfection then the bay
tried me with a second word much harder to be pronounced but reducing
it to the english orthography may be spelt thus houyhnhnm i did not
succeed in this so well as in the former but after two or three farther
trials i had better fortune and they both appeared amazed at my
after some further discourse which i then conjectured might relate to
me the two friends took their leaves with the same compliment of
striking each others hoof and the gray made me signs that i should walk
before him wherein i thought it prudent to comply till i could find a
better director when i offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun
hhuun i guessed his meaning and gave him to understand as well as i
could that i was weary and not able to walk faster upon which he
the author conducted by a houyhnhnm to his house the house described
the authors reception the food of the houyhnhnms the author in
distress for want of meat is at last relieved his manner of feeding
having travelled about three miles we came to a long kind of building
made of timber stuck in the ground and wattled across the roof was low
and covered with straw i now began to be a little comforted and took
out some toys which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage
indians of america and other parts in hopes the people of the house
would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly the horse made me a
sign to go in first it was a large room with a smooth clay floor and a
rack and manger extending the whole length on one side there were
three nags and two mares not eating but some of them sitting down upon
their hams which i very much wondered at but wondered more to see the
rest employed in domestic business these seemed but ordinary cattle
however this confirmed my first opinion that a people who could so far
civilise brute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the
world the gray came in just after and thereby prevented any ill
treatment which the others might have given me he neighed to them
several times in a style of authority and received answers
beyond this room there were three others reaching the length of the
house to which you passed through three doors opposite to each other
in the manner of a vista we went through the second room towards the
third here the gray walked in first beckoning me to attend i waited
in the second room and got ready my presents for the master and mistress
of the house they were two knives three bracelets of false pearls a
small looking glass and a bead necklace the horse neighed three or
