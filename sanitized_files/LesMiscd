and the star the soul will gravitate around the truth as the planet
around the light friends the present hour in which i am addressing
you is a gloomy hour but these are terrible purchases of the future
a revolution is a toll oh the human race will be delivered raised up
consoled we affirm it on this barrier whence should proceed that cry
of love if not from the heights of sacrifice oh my brothers this is
the point of junction of those who think and of those who suffer this
barricade is not made of paving stones nor of joists nor of bits of
iron it is made of two heaps a heap of ideas and a heap of woes here
misery meets the ideal the day embraces the night and says to it i
am about to die and thou shalt be born again with me from the embrace
of all desolations faith leaps forth sufferings bring hither their
agony and ideas their immortality this agony and this immortality are
about to join and constitute our death brothers he who dies here dies
in the radiance of the future and we are entering a tomb all flooded
enjolras paused rather than became silent his lips continued to move
silently as though he were talking to himself which caused them all
to gaze attentively at him in the endeavor to hear more there was no
applause but they whispered together for a long time speech being a
breath the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves
let us narrate what was passing in marius thoughts
let the reader recall the state of his soul we have just recalled it
everything was a vision to him now his judgment was disturbed marius
let us insist on this point was under the shadow of the great dark
wings which are spread over those in the death agony he felt that he
had entered the tomb it seemed to him that he was already on the other
side of the wall and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except
how did m fauchelevent come there why was he there what had he come
there to do marius did not address all these questions to himself
besides since our despair has this peculiarity that it envelops others
as well as ourselves it seemed logical to him that all the world should
only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart
however m fauchelevent did not speak to him did not look at him and
had not even the air of hearing him when marius raised his voice to
as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m fauchelevent was
comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions
we should say that it pleased him he had always felt the absolute
impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man who was in his eyes
both equivocal and imposing moreover it had been a long time since
he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for
the five chosen men left the barricade by way of mondetour lane they
bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard one of them
wept as he took his leave before setting out they embraced those who
when the five men sent back to life had taken their departure enjolras
thought of the man who had been condemned to death
he entered the tap room javert still bound to the post was engaged in
javert replied when are you going to kill me
wait we need all our cartridges just at present
enjolras himself offered him a glass of water and as javert was
i am uncomfortable against this post replied javert you are not
tender to have left me to pass the night here bind me as you please
but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man
and with a motion of the head he indicated the body of m mabeuf
there was as the reader will remember a long broad table at the
end of the room on which they had been running bullets and making
cartridges all the cartridges having been made and all the powder
at enjolras command four insurgents unbound javert from the post
while they were loosing him a fifth held a bayonet against his breast
leaving his arms tied behind his back they placed about his feet a
slender but stout whip cord as is done to men on the point of mounting
the scaffold which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in
length and made him walk to the table at the end of the room where
they laid him down closely bound about the middle of the body
by way of further security and by means of a rope fastened to his neck
they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt
at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a
martingale which starting at the neck forks on the stomach and meets
while they were binding javert a man standing on the threshold was
surveying him with singular attention the shadow cast by this man made
javert turn his head he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean
he did not even start but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself
the daylight was increasing rapidly not a window was opened not a door
stood ajar it was the dawn but not the awaking the end of the rue de
la chanvrerie opposite the barricade had been evacuated by the
troops as we have stated it seemed to be free and presented itself to
passers by with a sinister tranquillity the rue saint denis was as
dumb as the avenue of sphinxes at thebes not a living being in the
cross roads which gleamed white in the light of the sun nothing is so
mournful as this light in deserted streets nothing was to be seen but
there was something to be heard a mysterious movement was going on at
a certain distance it was evident that the critical moment was
approaching as on the previous evening the sentinels had come in but
the barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack
since the departure of the five they had increased its height still
on the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the
halles enjolras for fear of a surprise in the rear came to a serious
decision he had the small gut of the mondetour lane which had been
left open up to that time barricaded for this purpose they tore up
the pavement for the length of several houses more in this manner
the barricade walled on three streets in front on the rue de
la chanvrerie to the left on the rues du cygne and de la petite
truanderie to the right on the rue mondetour was really almost
impregnable it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there it
had three fronts but no exit a fortress but a rat hole too said
enjolras had about thirty paving stones torn up in excess said
bossuet piled up near the door of the wine shop
the silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must
needs come that enjolras had each man resume his post of battle
an allowance of brandy was doled out to each
nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault each
man selects his place as though at the theatre they jostle and elbow
and crowd each other there are some who make stalls of paving stones
here is a corner of the wall which is in the way it is removed here
is a redan which may afford protection they take shelter behind it
left handed men are precious they take the places that are inconvenient
to the rest many arrange to fight in a sitting posture they wish to be
at ease to kill and to die comfortably in the sad war of june 1848
an insurgent who was a formidable marksman and who was firing from the
top of a terrace upon a roof had a reclining chair brought there for
his use a charge of grape shot found him out there
as soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action
all disorderly movements cease there is no more pulling from one
another there are no more coteries no more asides there is no more
holding aloof everything in their spirits converges in and changes
into a waiting for the assailants a barricade before the arrival of
danger is chaos in danger it is discipline itself peril produces
as soon as enjolras had seized his double barrelled rifle and had
placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself
all the rest held their peace a series of faint sharp noises resounded
confusedly along the wall of paving stones it was the men cocking their
moreover their attitudes were prouder more confident than ever the
excess of sacrifice strengthens they no longer cherished any hope
but they had despair despair the last weapon which sometimes gives
victory virgil has said so supreme resources spring from extreme
resolutions to embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a
shipwreck and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety
as on the preceding evening the attention of all was directed we
might almost say leaned upon the end of the street now lighted up and
they had not long to wait a stir began distinctly in the saint leu
quarter but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack a
clashing of chains the uneasy jolting of a mass the click of brass
skipping along the pavement a sort of solemn uproar announced that
some sinister construction of iron was approaching there arose a tremor
in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets pierced and built for the
fertile circulation of interests and ideas and which are not made for
the horrible rumble of the wheels of war
the fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street
artillery men were pushing the piece it was in firing trim the
fore carriage had been detached two upheld the gun carriage four were
at the wheels others followed with the caisson they could see the
the whole barricade fired the report was terrible an avalanche of
smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men after a few seconds the
cloud dispersed and the cannon and men re appeared the gun crew had
just finished rolling it slowly correctly without haste into position
facing the barricade not one of them had been struck then the captain
of the piece bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle
began to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a
a moment later squarely planted in the very middle of the street
astride of the gutter the piece was ready for action a formidable pair
come merrily now ejaculated courfeyrac thats the brutal part of
it after the fillip on the nose the blow from the fist the army is
reaching out its big paw to us the barricade is going to be severely
shaken up the fusillade tries the cannon takes
it is a piece of eight new model brass added combeferre those
pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin
to one hundred of brass is exceeded the excess of tin renders them too
tender then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when
looked at from the vent hole in order to obviate this danger and
to render it possible to force the charge it may become necessary
to return to the process of the fourteenth century hooping and to
encircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands
from the breech to the trunnions in the meantime they remedy this
defect as best they may they manage to discover where the holes are
located in the vent of a cannon by means of a searcher but there is a
in the sixteenth century remarked bossuet they used to rifle
yes replied combeferre that augments the projectile force but
diminishes the accuracy of the firing in firing at short range
the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired the parabola is
exaggerated the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently
rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects which is
nevertheless a necessity of battle the importance of which increases
with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge
this defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled
cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge
small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic
necessities such for instance as the preservation of the
gun carriage in short that despot the cannon cannot do all that
it desires force is a great weakness a cannon ball only travels
six hundred leagues an hour light travels seventy thousand leagues a
second such is the superiority of jesus christ over napoleon
how was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the
cannon balls would they effect a breach that was the question while
the insurgents were reloading their guns the artillery men were loading
and gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed
he came from the direction of the rue du cygne and he had nimbly
climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of
gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the
the ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish at the most there was an
omnibus wheel broken and the old anceau cart was demolished on seeing
chapter viii the artillery men compel people to take them seriously
they flocked round gavroche but he had no time to tell anything marius
hullo said the child what are you doing here yourself
and he stared at marius intently with his epic effrontery his eyes grew
it was with an accent of severity that marius continued
who told you to come back did you deliver my letter at the address
gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter
in his haste to return to the barricade he had got rid of it rather
than delivered it he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had
confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been
able to make out it is true that the man was bareheaded but that was
not sufficient in short he had been administering to himself little
inward remonstrances and he feared marius reproaches in order to
extricate himself from the predicament he took the simplest course he
citizen i delivered the letter to the porter the lady was asleep she
will have the letter when she wakes up
marius had had two objects in sending that letter to bid farewell to
cosette and to save gavroche he was obliged to content himself with the
the despatch of his letter and the presence of m fauchelevent in the
barricade was a coincidence which occurred to him he pointed out m
gavroche had in fact as we have just mentioned seen jean valjean only
the troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in
marius mind were dissipated did he know m fauchelevents opinions
perhaps m fauchelevent was a republican hence his very natural
in the meanwhile gavroche was shouting at the other end of the
gavroche warned his comrades as he called them that the barricade was
blocked he had had great difficulty in reaching it a battalion of the
line whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite truanderie was on
the watch on the side of the rue du cygne on the opposite side the
municipal guard occupied the rue des precheurs the bulk of the army was
i authorize you to hit em a tremendous whack
meanwhile enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his
the assailants dissatisfied no doubt with their shot had not
a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of
the street behind the piece of ordnance the soldiers were tearing up
the pavement and constructing with the stones a small low wall a
sort of side work not more than eighteen inches high and facing the
barricade in the angle at the left of this epaulement there was
visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in
enjolras on the watch thought he distinguished the peculiar sound
which is produced when the shells of grape shot are drawn from the
caissons and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation
and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left then the
cannoneers began to load the piece the chief seized the lint stock
down with your heads hug the wall shouted enjolras and all on your
the insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine shop and
who had quitted their posts of combat on gavroches arrival rushed
pell mell towards the barricade but before enjolras order could be
executed the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round
of grape shot this is what it was in fact
the charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt and had there
rebounded from the wall and this terrible rebound had produced two dead
if this were continued the barricade was no longer tenable the
let us prevent the second discharge said enjolras
and lowering his rifle he took aim at the captain of the gun who at
that moment was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying
the captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery very
young blond with a very gentle face and the intelligent air peculiar
to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which by dint of perfecting
itself in horror must end in killing war
combeferre who was standing beside enjolras scrutinized this young
what a pity said combeferre what hideous things these butcheries
are come when there are no more kings there will be no more war
enjolras you are taking aim at that sergeant you are not looking at
him fancy he is a charming young man he is intrepid it is evident
that he is thoughtful those young artillery men are very well educated
he has a father a mother a family he is probably in love he is not
more than five and twenty at the most he might be your brother
yes replied combeferre he is mine too well let us not kill him
and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras marble cheek
at the same moment he pressed the trigger of his rifle the flame
leaped forth the artillery man turned round twice his arms extended in
front of him his head uplifted as though for breath then he fell with
his side on the gun and lay there motionless they could see his back
from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood the
ball had traversed his breast from side to side he was dead
he had to be carried away and replaced by another several minutes were
chapter ix employment of the old talents of a poacher and that
infallible marksmanship which influenced the condemnation of 1796
opinions were exchanged in the barricade the firing from the gun was
about to begin again against that grape shot they could not hold out
a quarter of an hour longer it was absolutely necessary to deaden the
we have none said combeferre the wounded are lying on them
jean valjean who was seated apart on a stone post at the corner of the
tavern with his gun between his knees had up to that moment taken
no part in anything that was going on he did not appear to hear the
combatants saying around him here is a gun that is doing nothing
at the order issued by enjolras he rose
it will be remembered that on the arrival of the rabble in the rue
de la chanvrerie an old woman foreseeing the bullets had placed her
mattress in front of her window this window an attic window was on
the roof of a six story house situated a little beyond the barricade
the mattress placed cross wise supported at the bottom on two poles
for drying linen was upheld at the top by two ropes which at that
distance looked like two threads and which were attached to two nails
planted in the window frames these ropes were distinctly visible like
can some one lend me a double barrelled rifle said jean valjean
enjolras who had just re loaded his handed it to him
jean valjean took aim at the attic window and fired
the mattress now hung by one thread only
jean valjean fired the second charge the second rope lashed the panes
of the attic window the mattress slipped between the two poles and fell
yes said combeferre but who will go and fetch it
the mattress had in fact fallen outside the barricade between
besiegers and besieged now the death of the sergeant of artillery
having exasperated the troop the soldiers had for several minutes
been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving stones which
they had erected and in order to supply the forced silence of
the piece which was quiet while its service was in course of
reorganization they had opened fire on the barricade the insurgents
did not reply to this musketry in order to spare their ammunition the
fusillade broke against the barricade but the street which it filled
jean valjean stepped out of the cut entered the street traversed the
storm of bullets walked up to the mattress hoisted it upon his back
he placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands he fixed it there
against the wall in such a manner that the artillery men should not see
that done they awaited the next discharge of grape shot
the cannon vomited forth its package of buck shot with a roar but there
was no rebound the effect which they had foreseen had been attained
citizen said enjolras to jean valjean the republic thanks you
it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power triumph of
that which yields over that which strikes with lightning but never
mind glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon
her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long sash window
facing the east on the back court yard of the house
cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris she had not been
there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her
cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly she had had sweet
dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very
white some one who was marius had appeared to her in the light she
awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the
effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on
emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself
thoroughly reassured like jean valjean she had a few hours
previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely
will not hear of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her
might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart it was
three days since she had seen marius but she said to herself that he
must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that
he was so clever that he would find means of reaching her and that
certainly to day and perhaps that very morning it was broad daylight
but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very
early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius
she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently
that was sufficient and that marius would come no objection was valid
all this was certain it was monstrous enough already to have suffered
for three days marius absent three days this was horrible on the part
of the good god now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone
through with marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news
youth is made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless
and does not accept it youth is the smile of the future in the presence
of an unknown quantity which is itself it is natural to it to be
happy it seems as though its respiration were made of hope
moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on
the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what
explanation of it he had given her every one has noticed with what
nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and
hides and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable there are
thoughts which play us the same trick they nestle away in a corner of
our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to
lay the memory on them cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little
effort made by her memory she told herself that it was very naughty
and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius
she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and
one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial
chamber not into a virginal chamber verse would hardly venture it
it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness
in the dark it is the private cell of a closed lily which must not be
gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it woman in the
bud is sacred that innocent bud which opens that adorable half nudity
which is afraid of itself that white foot which takes refuge in a
slipper that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though
a mirror were an eye that chemise which makes haste to rise up and
conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing
vehicle those cords tied those clasps fastened those laces drawn
those tremors those shivers of cold and modesty that exquisite
affright in every movement that almost winged uneasiness where there
is no cause for alarm the successive phases of dressing as charming as
the clouds of dawn it is not fitting that all this should be narrated
and it is too much to have even called attention to it
the eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a
young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star the possibility
of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect the down on the
peach the bloom on the plum the radiated crystal of the snow the wing
of the butterfly powdered with feathers are coarse compared to that
chastity which does not even know that it is chaste the young girl is
only the flash of a dream and is not yet a statue her bed chamber is
hidden in the sombre part of the ideal the indiscreet touch of a glance
brutalizes this vague penumbra here contemplation is profanation
we shall therefore show nothing of that sweet little flutter of
an oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by god but that
adam looked upon her when she was unfolding and she was ashamed and
turned crimson we are of the number who fall speechless in the presence
of young girls and flowers since we think them worthy of veneration
cosette dressed herself very hastily combed and dressed her hair which
was a very simple matter in those days when women did not swell out
their curls and bands with cushions and puffs and did not put crinoline
in their locks then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her
in every direction hoping to descry some bit of the street an angle of
the house an edge of pavement so that she might be able to watch for
marius there but no view of the outside was to be had the back court
was surrounded by tolerably high walls and the outlook was only on
several gardens cosette pronounced these gardens hideous for the first
time in her life she found flowers ugly the smallest scrap of the
gutter of the street would have met her wishes better she decided to
gaze at the sky as though she thought that marius might come from that
all at once she burst into tears not that this was fickleness of
soul but hopes cut in twain by dejection that was her case she had a
confused consciousness of something horrible thoughts were rife in the
air in fact she told herself that she was not sure of anything that
to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost and the idea that marius
could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but
then as is the nature of these clouds calm returned to her and hope
and a sort of unconscious smile which yet indicated trust in god
every one in the house was still asleep a country like silence reigned
not a shutter had been opened the porters lodge was closed toussaint
had not risen and cosette naturally thought that her father was
asleep she must have suffered much and she must have still been
suffering greatly for she said to herself that her father had been
unkind but she counted on marius the eclipse of such a light was
decidedly impossible now and then she heard sharp shocks in the
distance and she said it is odd that people should be opening and
shutting their carriage gates so early they were the reports of the
a few feet below cosettes window in the ancient and perfectly black
cornice of the wall there was a martins nest the curve of this nest
formed a little projection beyond the cornice so that from above it
was possible to look into this little paradise the mother was there
spreading her wings like a fan over her brood the father fluttered
about flew away then came back bearing in his beak food and kisses
the dawning day gilded this happy thing the great law multiply lay
there smiling and august and that sweet mystery unfolded in the
glory of the morning cosette with her hair in the sunlight her
soul absorbed in chimeras illuminated by love within and by the dawn
without bent over mechanically and almost without daring to avow to
herself that she was thinking at the same time of marius began to gaze
at these birds at this family at that male and female that mother and
her little ones with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a
chapter xi the shot which misses nothing and kills no one
the assailants fire continued musketry and grape shot alternated but
without committing great ravages to tell the truth the top alone of
the corinthe facade suffered the window on the first floor and the
attic window in the roof riddled with buck shot and biscaiens were
slowly losing their shape the combatants who had been posted there had
been obliged to withdraw however this is according to the tactics
of barricades to fire for a long while in order to exhaust the
insurgents ammunition if they commit the mistake of replying when it
is perceived from the slackening of their fire that they have no more
powder and ball the assault is made enjolras had not fallen into this
at every discharge by platoons gavroche puffed out his cheek with his
good for you said he rip up the cloth we want some lint
courfeyrac called the grape shot to order for the little effect which it
one gets puzzled in battle as at a ball it is probable that this
silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy
and to make them fear some unexpected incident and that they felt the
necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving stones and
of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received
blows without retorting the insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet
glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof a fireman had placed his
back against a tall chimney and seemed to be acting as sentinel his
jean valjean had returned enjolras rifle but he had his own gun
without saying a word he took aim at the fireman and a second later
the helmet smashed by a bullet rattled noisily into the street the
terrified soldier made haste to disappear a second observer took his
place this one was an officer jean valjean who had re loaded his
gun took aim at the newcomer and sent the officers casque to join the
soldiers the officer did not persist and retired speedily this time
the warning was understood no one made his appearance thereafter on
that roof and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned
why did you not kill the man bossuet asked jean valjean
he is a man who does good by gun shots said combeferre
those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch
know that the national guard from the suburbs was valiant against
insurrections it was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of
june 1832 a certain good dram shop keeper of pantin des vertus or
la cunette whose establishment had been closed by the riots became
leonine at the sight of his deserted dance hall and got himself killed
to preserve the order represented by a tea garden in that bourgeois and
heroic time in the presence of ideas which had their knights interests
had their paladins the prosiness of the originators detracted nothing
from the bravery of the movement the diminution of a pile of crowns
made bankers sing the marseillaise they shed their blood lyrically for
the counting house and they defended the shop that immense diminutive
at bottom we will observe there was nothing in all this that was not
extremely serious it was social elements entering into strife while
awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium
another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism
the barbarous name of the correct party people were for order in
the drum suddenly beat capricious calls at the command of such or
such a colonel of the national guard such and such a captain went into
action through inspiration such and such national guardsmen fought
for an idea and on their own account at critical moments on days
they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts there
existed in the army of order veritable guerilleros some of the sword
like fannicot others of the pen like henri fonfrede
civilization unfortunately represented at this epoch rather by an
aggregation of interests than by a group of principles was or thought
itself in peril it set up the cry of alarm each constituting himself
a centre defended it succored it and protected it with his own head
and the first comer took it upon himself to save society
zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination a platoon of the national
guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of
war and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes it
was an improvisation of this sort that had slain jean prouvaire fierce
lynch law with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest
for it has been applied by the republic in america as well as by the
monarchy in europe this lynch law was complicated with mistakes on one
day of rioting a young poet named paul aime garnier was pursued
in the place royale with a bayonet at his loins and only escaped by
taking refuge under the porte cochere of no 6 they shouted theres
another of those saint simonians and they wanted to kill him now he
had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the duc de saint simon
a national guard had read the words saint simon on the book and had
on the 6th of june 1832 a company of the national guards from the
suburbs commanded by the captain fannicot above mentioned had itself
decimated in the rue de la chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good
pleasure this fact singular though it may seem was proved at the
judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of
1832 captain fannicot a bold and impatient bourgeois a sort of
condottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized
a fanatical and intractable governmentalist could not resist the
temptation to fire prematurely and the ambition of capturing the
barricade alone and unaided that is to say with his company
exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old
coat which he took for the black flag he loudly blamed the generals and
chiefs of the corps who were holding council and did not think that the
moment for the decisive assault had arrived and who were allowing the
insurrection to fry in its own fat to use the celebrated expression
of one of them for his part he thought the barricade ripe and as that
which is ripe ought to fall he made the attempt
he commanded men as resolute as himself raging fellows as a witness
said his company the same which had shot jean prouvaire the poet was
the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street at the
moment when they were least expecting it the captain launched his men
against the barricade this movement executed with more good will than
strategy cost the fannicot company dear before it had traversed two
thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the
barricade four the most audacious who were running on in front
were mown down point blank at the very foot of the redoubt and this
courageous throng of national guards very brave men but lacking in
military tenacity were forced to fall back after some hesitation
leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement this momentary hesitation gave
the insurgents time to re load their weapons and a second and very
destructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the
corner of the street its shelter a moment more and it was caught
between two fires and it received the volley from the battery piece
which not having received the order had not discontinued its firing
the intrepid and imprudent fannicot was one of the dead from this
grape shot he was killed by the cannon that is to say by order
this attack which was more furious than serious irritated
enjolras the fools said he they are getting their own men killed
and they are using up our ammunition for nothing
enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he
was insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons
insurrection which is speedily exhausted has only a certain number
of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend an empty
cartridge box a man killed cannot be replaced as repression has the
army it does not count its men and as it has vincennes it does not
count its shots repression has as many regiments as the barricade has
men and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes thus
they are struggles of one against a hundred which always end in
crushing the barricade unless the revolution uprising suddenly
flings into the balance its flaming archangels sword this does happen
sometimes then everything rises the pavements begin to seethe popular
redoubts abound paris quivers supremely the quid divinum is given
forth a 10th of august is in the air a 29th of july is in the air a
wonderful light appears the yawning maw of force draws back and the
army that lion sees before it erect and tranquil that prophet
in the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade there
is a little of everything there is bravery there is youth honor
enthusiasm the ideal conviction the rage of the gambler and above
one of these intermittences one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly
traversed the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie at the moment when
listen suddenly cried enjolras who was still on the watch it seems
it is certain that on the morning of the 6th of june the insurrection
broke out afresh for an hour or two to a certain extent the obstinacy
of the alarm peal of saint merry reanimated some fancies barricades
were begun in the rue du poirier and the rue des gravilliers in front
of the porte saint martin a young man armed with a rifle attacked
alone a squadron of cavalry in plain sight on the open boulevard he
placed one knee on the ground shouldered his weapon fired killed the
commander of the squadron and turned away saying theres another who
he was put to the sword in the rue saint denis a woman fired on the
national guard from behind a lowered blind the slats of the blind could
be seen to tremble at every shot a child fourteen years of age
was arrested in the rue de la cossonerie with his pockets full of
cartridges many posts were attacked at the entrance to the rue
bertin poiree a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed
a regiment of cuirrassiers at whose head marched marshal general
cavaignac de barague in the rue planche mibray they threw old pieces
of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs a
bad sign and when this matter was reported to marshal soult napoleons
old lieutenant grew thoughtful as he recalled suchets saying at
saragossa we are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre
these general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when
it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local this fever
of wrath these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep
masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of paris all
this taken together disturbed the military chiefs they made haste to
they delayed the attack on the barricades maubuee de la chanvrerie and
saint merry until these sparks had been extinguished in order that they
might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish
them at one blow columns were thrown into the streets where there was
fermentation sweeping the large sounding the small right and left
now slowly and cautiously now at full charge the troops broke in
the doors of houses whence shots had been fired at the same time
manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards this
repression was not effected without some commotion and without that
tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the
people this was what enjolras had caught in the intervals of the
cannonade and the musketry moreover he had seen wounded men passing
the end of the street in litters and he said to courfeyrac those
their hope did not last long the gleam was quickly eclipsed in less
than half an hour what was in the air vanished it was a flash of
lightning unaccompanied by thunder and the insurgents felt that sort of
leaden cope which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate
and deserted men fall over them once more
the general movement which seemed to have assumed a vague outline had
miscarried and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of
the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades
we are hungry here are we really going to die like this without
enjolras who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure made an
affirmative sign with his head but without taking his eyes from the end
chapter xiv wherein will appear the name of enjolras mistress
courfeyrac seated on a paving stone beside enjolras continued to
insult the cannon and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles
which is called grape shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he
you are wearing out your lungs poor brutal old fellow you pain me
you are wasting your row thats not thunder its a cough
courfeyrac and bossuet whose brave good humor increased with the peril
like madame scarron replaced nourishment with pleasantry and as wine
was lacking they poured out gayety to all
i admire enjolras said bossuet his impassive temerity astounds
me he lives alone which renders him a little sad perhaps enjolras
complains of his greatness which binds him to widowhood the rest of us
have mistresses more or less who make us crazy that is to say brave
when a man is as much in love as a tiger the least that he can do is to
fight like a lion that is one way of taking our revenge for the capers
that mesdames our grisettes play on us roland gets himself killed for
angelique all our heroism comes from our women a man without a woman
is a pistol without a trigger it is the woman that sets the man off
well enjolras has no woman he is not in love and yet he manages to be
intrepid it is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice
enjolras did not appear to be listening but had any one been near him
that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice patria
and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement he added
in fact a new personage had entered on the scene this was a second
the artillery men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed
this second piece in line with the first
a few minutes later the two pieces rapidly served were firing
point blank at the redoubt the platoon firing of the line and of the
another cannonade was audible at some distance at the same time that
