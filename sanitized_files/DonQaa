expenditure of sweat he brought to a happy conclusion
it was with considerable reluctance that i abandoned in favour of the
present undertaking what had long been a favourite project that of a new
edition of sheltons don quixote which has now become a somewhat
scarce book there are some and i confess myself to be one for whom
sheltons racy old version with all its defects has a charm that no
modern translation however skilful or correct could possess shelton
had the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as
cervantes don quixote had to him a vitality that only a contemporary
could feel it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as cervantes saw
them there is no anachronism in his language he put the spanish of
cervantes into the english of shakespeare shakespeare himself most
likely knew the book he may have carried it home with him in his
saddle bags to stratford on one of his last journeys and under the
mulberry tree at new place joined hands with a kindred genius in its
but it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate
popularity for shelton was vain his fine old crusted english would no
doubt be relished by a minority but it would be only by a minority his
warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representative
of cervantes his translation of the first part was very hastily made and
was never revised by him it has all the freshness and vigour but also a
full measure of the faults of a hasty production it is often very
literal barbarously literal frequently but just as often very loose he
had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of spanish but apparently not
much more it never seems to occur to him that the same translation of a
it is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of don
quixote to those who are familiar with the original it savours of
truism or platitude to say so for in truth there can be no thoroughly
satisfactory translation of don quixote into english or any other
language it is not that the spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable
or that the untranslatable words numerous enough no doubt are so
superabundant but rather that the sententious terseness to which the
humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to spanish and can at
best be only distantly imitated in any other tongue
the history of our english translations of don quixote is instructive
sheltons the first in any language was made apparently about 1608
but not published till 1612 this of course was only the first part it
has been asserted that the second published in 1620 is not the work of
shelton but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that
it has less spirit less of what we generally understand by go about
it than the first which would be only natural if the first were the work
of a young man writing currente calamo and the second that of a
middle aged man writing for a bookseller on the other hand it is closer
and more literal the style is the same the very same translations or
mistranslations occur in it and it is extremely unlikely that a new
translator would by suppressing his name have allowed shelton to carry
in 1687 john phillips miltons nephew produced a don quixote made
english he says according to the humour of our modern language his
quixote is not so much a translation as a travesty and a travesty that
for coarseness vulgarity and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in
ned wards life and notable adventures of don quixote merrily
translated into hudibrastic verse 1700 can scarcely be reckoned a
translation but it serves to show the light in which don quixote was
a further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by
peter motteux who had then recently combined tea dealing with
literature it is described as translated from the original by several
hands but if so all spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the
manipulation of the several hands the flavour that it has on the other
hand is distinctly franco cockney anyone who compares it carefully with
the original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from shelton
and the french of filleau de saint martin eked out by borrowings from
phillips whose mode of treatment it adopts it is to be sure more
decent and decorous but it treats don quixote in the same fashion as a
comic book that cannot be made too comic
to attempt to improve the humour of don quixote by an infusion of
cockney flippancy and facetiousness as motteuxs operators did is not
merely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef but an
absolute falsification of the spirit of the book and it is a proof of
the uncritical way in which don quixote is generally read that this
worse than worthless translation worthless as failing to represent
worse than worthless as misrepresenting should have been favoured as it
it had the effect however of bringing out a translation undertaken and
executed in a very different spirit that of charles jervas the portrait
painter and friend of pope swift arbuthnot and gay jervas has been
allowed little credit for his work indeed it may be said none for it is
known to the world in general as jarviss it was not published until
after his death and the printers gave the name according to the current
pronunciation of the day it has been the most freely used and the most
freely abused of all the translations it has seen far more editions than
any other it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful
and yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author
jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface where
among many true words about shelton stevens and motteux he rashly and
unjustly charges shelton with having translated not from the spanish but
from the italian version of franciosini which did not appear until ten
years after sheltons first volume a suspicion of incompetence too
seems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and
a mediocre one though he has given us the best portrait we have of
swift and this may have been strengthened by popes remark that he
translated don quixote without understanding spanish he has been
also charged with borrowing from shelton whom he disparaged it is true
that in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelton and
gone astray with him but for one case of this sort there are fifty
where he is right and shelton wrong as for popes dictum anyone who
examines jervass version carefully side by side with the original will
see that he was a sound spanish scholar incomparably a better one than
shelton except perhaps in mere colloquial spanish he was in fact an
honest faithful and painstaking translator and he has left a version
which whatever its shortcomings may be is singularly free from errors
the charge against it is that it is stiff dry wooden in a word and
no one can deny that there is a foundation for it but it may be pleaded
for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of
the light flippant jocose style of his predecessors he was one of the
few very few translators that have shown any apprehension of the
unsmiling gravity which is the essence of quixotic humour it seemed to
him a crime to bring cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own
good things and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic
abstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the
characteristic of his translation in most modern editions it should be
observed his style has been smoothed and smartened but without any
reference to the original spanish so that if he has been made to read
more agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity
smolletts version published in 1755 may be almost counted as one of
these at any rate it is plain that in its construction jervass
translation was very freely drawn upon and very little or probably no
the later translations may be dismissed in a few words george kellys
which appeared in 1769 printed for the translator was an impudent
imposture being nothing more than motteuxs version with a few of the
words here and there artfully transposed charles wilmots 1774 was
only an abridgment like florians but not so skilfully executed and the
version published by miss smirke in 1818 to accompany her brothers
plates was merely a patchwork production made out of former
translations on the latest mr a j duffields it would be in every
sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here i had not
even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me and since
then i may say vidi tantum having for obvious reasons resisted the
temptation which mr duffields reputation and comely volumes hold out to
from the foregoing history of our translations of don quixote it will
be seen that there are a good many people who provided they get the mere
narrative with its full complement of facts incidents and adventures
served up to them in a form that amuses them care very little whether
that form is the one in which cervantes originally shaped his ideas on
the other hand it is clear that there are many who desire to have not
merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least
as differences of idiom and circumstances permit and who will give a
preference to the conscientious translator even though he may have
but after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes there
is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other or why
a translator who makes it his aim to treat don quixote with the respect
due to a great classic should not be as acceptable even to the careless
reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest book it is not a
question of caviare to the general or if it is the fault rests with
him who makes so the method by which cervantes won the ear of the
spanish people ought mutatis mutandis to be equally effective with the
great majority of english readers at any rate even if there are readers
to whom it is a matter of indifference fidelity to the method is as much
a part of the translators duty as fidelity to the matter if he can
please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those
who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is
in his power to give them faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is
practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it
my purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation but to
indicate those i have followed or at least tried to the best of my
ability to follow in the present instance one which it seems to me
cannot be too rigidly followed in translating don quixote is to avoid
everything that savours of affectation the book itself is indeed in
one sense a protest against it and no man abhorred it more than
cervantes for this reason i think any temptation to use antiquated or
obsolete language should be resisted it is after all an affectation and
one for which there is no warrant or excuse spanish has probably
undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in
europe and by far the greater and certainly the best part of don
quixote differs but little in language from the colloquial spanish of
the present day except in the tales and don quixotes speeches the
translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will
almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original
seeing that the story of don quixote and all its characters and
incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar
as household words in english mouths it seems to me that the old
familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason of
course a translator who holds that don quixote should receive the
treatment a great classic deserves will feel himself bound by the
injunction laid upon the morisco in chap ix not to omit or add anything
four generations had laughed over don quixote before it occurred to
anyone to ask who and what manner of man was this miguel de cervantes
saavedra whose name is on the title page and it was too late for a
satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of
the author to the london edition published at lord carterets instance in
1738 all traces of the personality of cervantes had by that time
disappeared any floating traditions that may once have existed
transmitted from men who had known him had long since died out and of
other record there was none for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
were incurious as to the men of the time a reproach against which the
nineteenth has at any rate secured itself if it has produced no
shakespeare or cervantes all that mayans y siscar to whom the task was
entrusted or any of those who followed him rios pellicer or
navarrete could do was to eke out the few allusions cervantes makes to
himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence
bearing upon his life as they could find
this however has been done by the last named biographer to such good
purpose that he has superseded all predecessors thoroughness is the
chief characteristic of navarretes work besides sifting testing and
methodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously
brought to light he left as the saying is no stone unturned under
which anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found
navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do and it is no
fault of his if he has not given us what we want what hallam says of
shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of cervantes it
is not the register of his baptism or the draft of his will or the
orthography of his name that we seek no letter of his writing no record
of his conversation no character of him drawn  by a contemporary has
it is only natural therefore that the biographers of cervantes forced
to make brick without straw should have recourse largely to conjecture
and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the
place of established fact all that i propose to do here is to separate
what is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture and leave it to
the readers judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or
the men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of spanish
literature cervantes lope de vega quevedo calderon garcilaso de la
vega the mendozas gongora were all men of ancient families and
curiously all except the last of families that traced their origin to
the same mountain district in the north of spain the family of cervantes
is commonly said to have been of galician origin and unquestionably it
was in possession of lands in galicia at a very early date but i think
the balance of the evidence tends to show that the solar the original
site of the family was at cervatos in the north west corner of old
castile close to the junction of castile leon and the asturias as it
happens there is a complete history of the cervantes family from the
tenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of
illustrious ancestry glorious deeds and noble posterity of the famous
nuno alfonso alcaide of toledo written in 1648 by the industrious
genealogist rodrigo mendez silva who availed himself of a manuscript
genealogy by juan de mena the poet laureate and historiographer of john
the origin of the name cervantes is curious nuno alfonso was almost as
distinguished in the struggle against the moors in the reign of alfonso
vii as the cid had been half a century before in that of alfonso vi and
was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of toledo on
one of his acquisitions about two leagues from the city he built
himself a castle which he called cervatos because he was lord of the
solar of cervatos in the montana as the mountain region extending from
the basque provinces to leon was always called at his death in battle in
1143 the castle passed by his will to his son alfonso munio who as
territorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the
simple patronymic took the additional name of cervatos his eldest son
pedro succeeded him in the possession of the castle and followed his
example in adopting the name an assumption at which the younger son
everyone who has paid even a flying visit to toledo will remember the
ruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of
alcantara spans the gorge of the tagus and with its broken outline and
crumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid
alcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side it was built
or as some say restored by alfonso vi shortly after his occupation of
toledo in 1085 and called by him san servando after a spanish martyr a
name subsequently modified into san servan in which form it appears in
the poem of the cid san servantes and san cervantes with regard to
which last the handbook for spain warns its readers against the
supposition that it has anything to do with the author of don quixote
ford as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on
the roads of spain is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history
in this instance however he is in error it has everything to do with
the author of don quixote for it is in fact these old walls that have
given to spain the name she is proudest of to day gonzalo above
mentioned it may be readily conceived did not relish the appropriation
by his brother of a name to which he himself had an equal right for
though nominally taken from the castle it was in reality derived from
the ancient territorial possession of the family and as a set off and
to distinguish himself diferenciarse from his brother he took as a
surname the name of the castle on the bank of the tagus in the building
of which according to a family tradition his great grandfather had a
both brothers founded families the cervantes branch had more tenacity
it sent offshoots in various directions andalusia estremadura galicia
and portugal and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the
service of church and state gonzalo himself and apparently a son of
his followed ferdinand iii in the great campaign of 1236 48 that gave
cordova and seville to christian spain and penned up the moors in the
kingdom of granada and his descendants intermarried with some of the
noblest families of the peninsula and numbered among them soldiers
magistrates and church dignitaries including at least two
of the line that settled in andalusia deigo de cervantes commander of
the order of santiago married juana avellaneda daughter of juan arias
de saavedra and had several sons of whom one was gonzalo gomez
corregidor of jerez and ancestor of the mexican and columbian branches of
the family and another juan whose son rodrigo married dona leonor de
cortinas and by her had four children rodrigo andrea luisa and
the pedigree of cervantes is not without its bearing on don quixote a
man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights errant
extending from well nigh the time of pelayo to the siege of granada was
likely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of
the romances it gives a point too to what he says in more than one
place about families that have once been great and have tapered away
until they have come to nothing like a pyramid it was the case of his
he was born at alcala de henares and baptised in the church of santa
maria mayor on the 9th of october 1547 of his boyhood and youth we know
nothing unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his
comedies of himself as a boy looking on with delight while lope de
rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and
acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of
his interludes this first glimpse however is a significant one for it
shows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised
such an influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grew
older and of which this very preface written only a few months before
his death is such a striking proof he gives us to understand too that
he was a great reader in his youth but of this no assurance was needed
for the first part of don quixote alone proves a vast amount of
miscellaneous reading romances of chivalry ballads popular poetry
chronicles for which he had no time or opportunity except in the first
twenty years of his life and his misquotations and mistakes in matters
of detail are always it may be noticed those of a man recalling the
other things besides the drama were in their infancy when cervantes was a
boy the period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period for
spain the old chivalrous spain had passed away the new spain was the
mightiest power the world had seen since the roman empire and it had not
yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness by the policy of
ferdinand and ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute and the
church and inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so the nobles who
had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the
moors had been divested of all political power a like fate had befallen
the cities the free constitutions of castile and aragon had been swept
away and the only function that remained to the cortes was that of
the transition extended to literature men who like garcilaso de la vega
and diego hurtado de mendoza followed the italian wars had brought back
from italy the products of the post renaissance literature which took
root and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths
damon and thyrsis phyllis and chloe had been fairly naturalised in
spain together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing
with an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible
shepherdess as a set off against this the old historical and
traditional ballads and the true pastorals the songs and ballads of
peasant life were being collected assiduously and printed in the
cancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity but the
most notable consequence perhaps of the spread of printing was the
flood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press
ever since garci ordonez de montalvo had resuscitated amadis of gaul at
for a youth fond of reading solid or light there could have been no
better spot in spain than alcala de henares in the middle of the
sixteenth century it was then a busy populous university town
something more than the enterprising rival of salamanca and altogether a
very different place from the melancholy silent deserted alcala the
traveller sees now as he goes from madrid to saragossa theology and
medicine may have been the strong points of the university but the town
itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light
literature and as a producer of books alcala was already beginning to
compete with the older presses of toledo burgos salamanca and seville
a pendant to the picture cervantes has given us of his first playgoings
might no doubt have been often seen in the streets of alcala at that
time a bright eager tawny haired boy peering into a book shop where
the latest volumes lay open to tempt the public wondering it may be
what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy
that called itself vida de lazarillo de tormes segunda impresion
could be about or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one
of those preposterous portraits of a knight errant in outrageous panoply
and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to
embellish the title pages of their folios if the boy was the father of
the man the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively
at ten and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis
for his more solid education we are told he went to salamanca but why
rodrigo de cervantes who was very poor should have sent his son to a
university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own
door would be a puzzle if we had any reason for supposing that he did
so the only evidence is a vague statement by professor tomas gonzalez
that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a miguel de
cervantes this does not appear to have been ever seen again but even if
it had and if the date corresponded it would prove nothing as there
were at least two other miguels born about the middle of the century one
of them moreover a cervantes saavedra a cousin no doubt who was a
that he was a student neither at salamanca nor at alcala is best proved
by his own works no man drew more largely upon experience than he did
and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life for the
tia fingida if it be his is not one nothing not even a college
joke to show that he remembered days that most men remember best all
that we know positively about his education is that juan lopez de hoyos
a professor of humanities and belles lettres of some eminence calls him
his dear and beloved pupil this was in a little collection of verses
by different hands on the death of isabel de valois second queen of
philip ii published by the professor in 1569 to which cervantes
contributed four pieces including an elegy and an epitaph in the form
of a sonnet it is only by a rare chance that a lycidas finds its way
into a volume of this sort and cervantes was no milton his verses are
no worse than such things usually are so much at least may be said for
by the time the book appeared he had left spain and as fate ordered it
for twelve years the most eventful ones of his life giulio afterwards
cardinal acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to philip ii by the
pope on a mission partly of condolence partly political and on his
return to rome which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the king he
took cervantes with him as his camarero chamberlain the office he
himself held in the popes household the post would no doubt have led to
advancement at the papal court had cervantes retained it but in the
summer of 1570 he resigned it and enlisted as a private soldier in
captain diego urbinas company belonging to don miguel de moncadas
regiment but at that time forming a part of the command of marc antony
colonna what impelled him to this step we know not whether it was
distaste for the career before him or purely military enthusiasm it may
well have been the latter for it was a stirring time the events
however which led to the alliance between spain venice and the pope
against the common enemy the porte and to the victory of the combined
fleets at lepanto belong rather to the history of europe than to the
life of cervantes he was one of those that sailed from messina in
september 1571 under the command of don john of austria but on the
morning of the 7th of october when the turkish fleet was sighted he was
lying below ill with fever at the news that the enemy was in sight he
rose and in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors
insisted on taking his post saying he preferred death in the service of
god and the king to health his galley the marquesa was in the thick of
the fight and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds
two in the breast and one in the left hand or arm on the morning after
the battle according to navarrete he had an interview with the
commander in chief don john who was making a personal inspection of the
wounded one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his pay
and another apparently the friendship of his general
how severely cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact that
with youth a vigorous frame and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament
as ever invalid had he was seven months in hospital at messina before he
was discharged he came out with his left hand permanently disabled he
had lost the use of it as mercury told him in the viaje del parnaso
for the greater glory of the right this however did not absolutely
unfit him for service and in april 1572 he joined manuel ponce de leons
company of lope de figueroas regiment in which it seems probable his
brother rodrigo was serving and shared in the operations of the next
three years including the capture of the goletta and tunis taking
advantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the
turks he obtained leave to return to spain and sailed from naples in
september 1575 on board the sun galley in company with his brother
rodrigo pedro carrillo de quesada late governor of the goletta and
some others and furnished with letters from don john of austria and the
duke of sesa the viceroy of sicily recommending him to the king for the
command of a company on account of his services a dono infelice as
events proved on the 26th they fell in with a squadron of algerine
galleys and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into
by means of a ransomed fellow captive the brothers contrived to inform
their family of their condition and the poor people at alcala at once
strove to raise the ransom money the father disposing of all he
possessed and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions but
dali mami had found on cervantes the letters addressed to the king by don
john and the duke of sesa and concluding that his prize must be a
person of great consequence when the money came he refused it scornfully
as being altogether insufficient the owner of rodrigo however was more
easily satisfied ransom was accepted in his case and it was arranged
between the brothers that he should return to spain and procure a vessel
in which he was to come back to algiers and take off miguel and as many
of their comrades as possible this was not the first attempt to escape
that cervantes had made soon after the commencement of his captivity he
induced several of his companions to join him in trying to reach oran
then a spanish post on foot but after the first days journey the moor
who had agreed to act as their guide deserted them and they had no
choice but to return the second attempt was more disastrous in a garden
outside the city on the sea shore he constructed with the help of the
gardener a spaniard a hiding place to which he brought one by one
fourteen of his fellow captives keeping them there in secrecy for
several months and supplying them with food through a renegade known as
el dorador the gilder how he a captive himself contrived to do all
this is one of the mysteries of the story wild as the project may
appear it was very nearly successful the vessel procured by rodrigo
made its appearance off the coast and under cover of night was
proceeding to take off the refugees when the crew were alarmed by a
passing fishing boat and beat a hasty retreat on renewing the attempt
shortly afterwards they or a portion of them at least were taken
prisoners and just as the poor fellows in the garden were exulting in
the thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their
grasp they found themselves surrounded by turkish troops horse and
foot the dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the dey hassan
when cervantes saw what had befallen them he charged his companions to
lay all the blame upon him and as they were being bound he declared
aloud that the whole plot was of his contriving and that nobody else had
any share in it brought before the dey he said the same he was
threatened with impalement and with torture and as cutting off ears and
noses were playful freaks with the algerines it may be conceived what
their tortures were like but nothing could make him swerve from his
original statement that he and he alone was responsible the upshot was
that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master and the prisoners
taken possession of by the dey who however afterwards restored most of
them to their masters but kept cervantes paying dali mami 500 crowns
for him he felt no doubt that a man of such resource energy and
daring was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private
hands and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison if he
thought that by these means he could break the spirit or shake the
resolution of his prisoner he was soon undeceived for cervantes
contrived before long to despatch a letter to the governor of oran
entreating him to send him some one that could be trusted to enable him
and three other gentlemen fellow captives of his to make their escape
intending evidently to renew his first attempt with a more trustworthy
guide unfortunately the moor who carried the letter was stopped just
outside oran and the letter being found upon him he was sent back to
algiers where by the order of the dey he was promptly impaled as a
warning to others while cervantes was condemned to receive two thousand
blows of the stick a number which most likely would have deprived the
world of don quixote had not some persons who they were we know not
after this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than
before for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt this
time his plan was to purchase by the aid of a spanish renegade and two
valencian merchants resident in algiers an armed vessel in which he and
about sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape but just
as they were about to put it into execution one doctor juan blanco de
paz an ecclesiastic and a compatriot informed the dey of the plot
cervantes by force of character by his self devotion by his untiring
energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery
had endeared himself to all and become the leading spirit in the captive
colony and incredible as it may seem jealousy of his influence and the
esteem in which he was held moved this man to compass his destruction by
a cruel death the merchants finding that the dey knew all and fearing
that cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil
their own lives tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel
that was on the point of sailing for spain but he told them they had
nothing to fear for no tortures would make him compromise anybody and
he went at once and gave himself up to the dey
as before the dey tried to force him to name his accomplices everything
was made ready for his immediate execution the halter was put round his
neck and his hands tied behind him but all that could be got from him
was that he himself with the help of four gentlemen who had since left
algiers had arranged the whole and that the sixty who were to accompany
him were not to know anything of it until the last moment finding he
could make nothing of him the dey sent him back to prison more heavily
the poverty stricken cervantes family had been all this time trying once
more to raise the ransom money and at last a sum of three hundred ducats
was got together and entrusted to the redemptorist father juan gil who
was about to sail for algiers the dey however demanded more than
double the sum offered and as his term of office had expired and he was
about to sail for constantinople taking all his slaves with him the
case of cervantes was critical he was already on board heavily ironed
when the dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one half and
father gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount and on september
19 1580 after a captivity of five years all but a week cervantes was
at last set free before long he discovered that blanco de paz who
claimed to be an officer of the inquisition was now concocting on false
evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return
to spain to checkmate him cervantes drew up a series of twenty five
questions covering the whole period of his captivity upon which he
requested father gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before
a notary eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in
algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more
besides there is something touching in the admiration love and
gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of
the notary as they testify one after another to the good deeds of
cervantes how he comforted and helped the weak hearted how he kept up
their drooping courage how he shared his poor purse with this deponent
and how in him this deponent found father and mother
on his return to spain he found his old regiment about to march for
portugal to support philips claim to the crown and utterly penniless
now had no choice but to rejoin it he was in the expeditions to the
azores in 1582 and the following year and on the conclusion of the war
returned to spain in the autumn of 1583 bringing with him the manuscript
of his pastoral romance the galatea and probably also to judge by
internal evidence that of the first portion of persiles and
sigismunda he also brought back with him his biographers assert an
infant daughter the offspring of an amour as some of them with great
circumstantiality inform us with a lisbon lady of noble birth whose
name however as well as that of the street she lived in they omit to
mention the sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly
was living in the family of cervantes a dona isabel de saavedra who is
described in an official document as his natural daughter and then
with his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless now that
don john was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services and
for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect he
had already a certain reputation as a poet he made up his mind
therefore to cast his lot with literature and for a first venture
committed his galatea to the press it was published as salva y mallen
shows conclusively at alcala his own birth place in 1585 and no doubt
helped to make his name more widely known but certainly did not do him
while it was going through the press he married dona catalina de
palacios salazar y vozmediano a lady of esquivias near madrid and
apparently a friend of the family who brought him a fortune which may
possibly have served to keep the wolf from the door but if so that was
all the drama had by this time outgrown market place stages and
strolling companies and with his old love for it he naturally turned to
it for a congenial employment in about three years he wrote twenty or
thirty plays which he tells us were performed without any throwing of
cucumbers or other missiles and ran their course without any hisses
outcries or disturbance in other words his plays were not bad enough
to be hissed off the stage but not good enough to hold their own upon
it only two of them have been preserved but as they happen to be two of
the seven or eight he mentions with complacency we may assume they are
favourable specimens and no one who reads the numancia and the trato
de argel will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas
whatever merits they may have whatever occasional they may show they
are as regards construction incurably clumsy how completely they
failed is manifest from the fact that with all his sanguine temperament
and indomitable perseverance he was unable to maintain the struggle to
gain a livelihood as a dramatist for more than three years nor was the
rising popularity of lope the cause as is often said notwithstanding
his own words to the contrary when lope began to write for the stage is
uncertain but it was certainly after cervantes went to seville
among the nuevos documentos printed by senor asensio y toledo is one
dated 1592 and curiously characteristic of cervantes it is an agreement
with one rodrigo osorio a manager who was to accept six comedies at
fifty ducats about 6l apiece not to be paid in any case unless it
appeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best that
had ever been represented in spain the test does not seem to have been
ever applied perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to rodrigo osorio that
the comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented
among the correspondence of cervantes there might have been found no
doubt more than one letter like that we see in the rakes progress
sir i have read your play and it will not doo
he was more successful in a literary contest at saragossa in 1595 in
honour of the canonisation of st jacinto when his composition won the
first prize three silver spoons the year before this he had been
appointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of granada in order to
remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury he
entrusted it to a merchant who failed and absconded and as the
bankrupts assets were insufficient to cover the whole he was sent to
prison at seville in september 1597 the balance against him however
was a small one about 26l and on giving security for it he was
it was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the kings taxes
that he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that
abound in the pages of don quixote the benedictine monks with
spectacles and sunshades mounted on their tall mules the strollers in
costume bound for the next village the barber with his basin on his
head on his way to bleed a patient the recruit with his breeches in his
bundle tramping along the road singing the reapers gathered in the
venta gateway listening to felixmarte of hircania read out to them and
those little hogarthian touches that he so well knew how to bring in the
ox tail hanging up with the landlords comb stuck in it the wine skins
at the bed head and those notable examples of hostelry art helen going
off in high spirits on pariss arm and dido on the tower dropping tears
as big as walnuts nay it may well be that on those journeys into remote
regions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman
with his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry dreaming
away his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his
great grandfathers old helmet was new but it was in seville that he
found out his true vocation though he himself would not by any means
have admitted it to be so it was there in triana that he was first
tempted to try his hand at drawing from life and first brought his
humour into play in the exquisite little sketch of rinconete y
cortadillo the germ in more ways than one of don quixote
where and when that was written we cannot tell after his imprisonment
all trace of cervantes in his official capacity disappears from which it
may be inferred that he was not reinstated that he was still in seville
in november 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaborate
catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of
philip ii but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements the
words in the preface to the first part of don quixote are generally
held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book and wrote
the beginning of it at least in a prison and that he may have done so
there is a tradition that cervantes read some portions of his work to a
select audience at the duke of bejars which may have helped to make the
book known but the obvious conclusion is that the first part of don
quixote lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold
enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character and so little
faith in it had francisco robles of madrid to whom at last he sold it
that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for
aragon or portugal contenting himself with that for castile the
printing was finished in december and the book came out with the new
year 1605 it is often said that don quixote was at first received
coldly the facts show just the contrary no sooner was it in the hands
of the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at
lisbon and valencia and to bring out a second edition with the
additional copyrights for aragon and portugal which he secured in
no doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain
sections of the community men of wit taste and discrimination among
the aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome but the aristocracy in general
were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into
ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas the dramatists
who gathered round lope as their leader regarded cervantes as their
common enemy and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other
clique the culto poets who had gongora for their chief navarrete who
knew nothing of the letter above mentioned tries hard to show that the
relations between cervantes and lope were of a very friendly sort as
indeed they were until don quixote was written cervantes indeed to
the last generously and manfully declared his admiration of lopes
powers his unfailing invention and his marvellous fertility but in the
preface of the first part of don quixote and in the verses of urganda
the unknown and one or two other places there are if we read between
the lines sly hits at lopes vanities and affectations that argue no
personal good will and lope openly sneers at don quixote and
cervantes and fourteen years after his death gives him only a few lines
of cold commonplace in the laurel de apolo that seem all the colder
for the eulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere
in 1601 valladolid was made the seat of the court and at the beginning
of 1603 cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the
balance due by him to the treasury which was still outstanding he
remained at valladolid apparently supporting himself by agencies and
scriveners work of some sort probably drafting petitions and drawing up
statements of claims to be presented to the council and the like so at
least we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death
of a gentleman the victim of a street brawl who had been carried into
the house in which he lived in these he himself is described as a man
