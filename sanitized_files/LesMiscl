the two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard in
opposite directions and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the
chapter ii jean valjean still wears his arm in a sling
to realize ones dream to whom is this accorded there must be
elections for this in heaven we are all candidates unknown to
ourselves the angels vote cosette and marius had been elected
cosette both at the mayors office and at church was dazzling and
touching toussaint assisted by nicolette had dressed her
cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta her robe of binche
guipure a veil of english point a necklace of fine pearls a wreath
of orange flowers all this was white and from the midst of that
whiteness she beamed forth it was an exquisite candor expanding and
becoming transfigured in the light one would have pronounced her a
virgin on the point of turning into a goddess
marius handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed here and there beneath
the thick curls pale lines the scars of the barricade were visible
the grandfather haughty with head held high amalgamating more than
ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of
barras escorted cosette he took the place of jean valjean who on
account of his arm being still in a sling could not give his hand to
jean valjean dressed in black followed them with a smile
monsieur fauchelevent said the grandfather to him this is a fine
day i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows henceforth there
must be no sadness anywhere pardieu i decree joy evil has no right to
exist that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace
to the azure of the sky evil does not come from man who is good at
bottom all human miseries have for their capital and central government
hell otherwise known as the devils tuileries good here i am
uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer
any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful
when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced
before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses after
having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy
after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side
under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer they arrived
hand in hand admired and envied by all marius in black she in white
preceded by the suisse with the epaulets of a colonel tapping the
pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at
the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open
ready to enter their carriage again and all being finished cosette
still could not believe that it was real she looked at marius she
looked at the crowd she looked at the sky it seemed as though she
feared that she should wake up from her dream her amazed and uneasy air
added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty they entered the
same carriage to return home marius beside cosette m gillenormand
and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one
my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron
and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres
and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic
whisper so it is true my name is marius i am madame thou
these two creatures were resplendent they had reached that irrevocable
and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and
all joy they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty
years old taken together it was marriage sublimated these two children
were two lilies they did not see each other they did not contemplate
each other cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius
perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar and in that glory the
two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a
cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the
real thing the meeting of the kiss and the dream the nuptial pillow
all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in
intoxication it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless
nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair
converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming
the charming hour which was approaching and that their griefs were but
so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy how good it is
to have suffered their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness
the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension
it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness
in marius and with modesty in cosette they said to each other in low
tones we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue
plumet the folds of cosettes gown lay across marius
such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality one
possesses and one supposes one still has time before one to divine the
emotion on that day of being at mid day and of dreaming of midnight
is indescribable the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the
crowd and inspired the passers by with cheerfulness
people halted in the rue saint antoine in front of saint paul to gaze
through the windows of the carriage at the orange flowers quivering on
then they returned home to the rue des filles du calvaire marius
triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase
up which he had been borne in a dying condition the poor who had
trooped to the door and who shared their purses blessed them there
were flowers everywhere the house was no less fragrant than the church
after the incense roses they thought they heard voices carolling in
the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them
like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a
rising sun all at once the clock struck marius glanced at cosettes
charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible
through the lace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius
quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had
been invited they pressed about cosette each one vied with the rest in
the officer theodule gillenormand now a captain had come from
chartres where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the
wedding of his cousin pontmercy cosette did not recognize him
he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him
handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other
how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer said
cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean she was in unison
with father gillenormand while he erected joy into aphorisms and
maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume happiness desires that all
she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of
voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl she caressed him
a banquet had been spread in the dining room
illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of
a great joy mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy they do
not consent to be black the night yes the shadows no if there is no
the dining room was full of gay things in the centre above the white
and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all
sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the
candles around the chandelier girandoles on the walls sconces with
triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate
porcelain faience pottery gold and silversmiths work all was
sparkling and gay the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled
in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a
in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartettes
jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing room behind
the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to
nearly conceal him a few moments before they sat down to table cosette
came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy
spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly
a few moments later basque announced that dinner was served
the guests preceded by m gillenormand with cosette on his arm entered
the dining room and arranged themselves in the proper order around the
two large arm chairs figured on the right and left of the bride the
first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean m gillenormand
took his seat the other arm chair remained empty
sir replied basque i do precisely m fauchelevent told me to say
to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him
somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron and madame
la baronne that he begged to be excused that he would come to morrow
that empty arm chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a
moment but if m fauchelevent was absent m gillenormand was present
and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had
done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a
slight ailment this declaration sufficed moreover what is an obscure
corner in such a submersion of joy cosette and marius were passing
through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other
faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness and then
an idea occurred to m gillenormand pardieu this armchair is empty
come hither marius your aunt will permit it although she has a
right to you this armchair is for you that is legal and delightful
fortunatus beside fortunata applause from the whole table marius
took jean valjeans place beside cosette and things fell out so that
cosette who had at first been saddened by jean valjeans absence
ended by being satisfied with it from the moment when marius took his
place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god
himself she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius
the arm chair being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and
and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other
was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness
at dessert m gillenormand rising to his feet with a glass of
champagne in his hand only half full so that the palsy of his eighty
years might not cause an overflow proposed the health of the married
you shall not escape two sermons he exclaimed this morning you
had one from the cure this evening you shall have one from your

use there would be in having any springtime and for my own part i
should pray the good god to shut up all the beautiful things that he
shows us and to take away from us and put back in his box the flowers

the evening was gay lively and agreeable the grandfathers sovereign
good humor gave the key note to the whole feast and each person
regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality they danced
a little they laughed a great deal it was an amiable wedding goodman
days of yore might have been invited to it however he was present in
a little after midnight the gillenormand house became a temple
here we pause on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel
the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the
there should be flashes of light athwart such houses the joy which
they contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in
brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom it is impossible that this
sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to
the infinite love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man
and the woman takes place the being one the being triple the being
final the human trinity proceeds from it this birth of two souls into
one ought to be an emotion for the gloom the lover is the priest
the ravished virgin is terrified something of that joy ascends to god
where true marriage is that is to say where there is love the ideal
enters in a nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows if it
were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming
visions of the upper life it is probable that we should behold the
forms of night the winged unknowns the blue passers of the invisible
bend down a throng of sombre heads around the luminous house
satisfied showering benedictions pointing out to each other the virgin
wife gently alarmed sweetly terrified and bearing the reflection of
human bliss upon their divine countenances if at that supreme hour the
wedded pair dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone
were to listen they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of
wings perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels
that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling when two
mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible
that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering
these felicities are the true ones there is no joy outside of these
joys love is the only ecstasy all the rest weeps
to love or to have loved this suffices demand nothing more there
is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life to love is a
immediately after having laughed at cosettes graceful command when
no one was paying any heed to him jean valjean had risen and had gained
the antechamber unperceived this was the very room which eight months
before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing
back the grandson to the grandfather the old wainscoting was garlanded
with foliage and flowers the musicians were seated on the sofa on which
they had laid marius down basque in a black coat knee breeches white
stockings and white gloves was arranging roses round all of the dishes
that were to be served jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling
charged basque to explain his absence and went away
the long windows of the dining room opened on the street jean valjean
stood for several minutes erect and motionless in the darkness beneath
those radiant windows he listened the confused sounds of the banquet
reached his ear he heard the loud commanding tones of the grandfather
the violins the clatter of the plates the bursts of laughter and
through all that merry uproar he distinguished cosettes sweet and
he quitted the rue des filles du calvaire and returned to the rue de
in order to return thither he took the rue saint louis the rue
culture sainte catherine and the blancs manteaux it was a little
longer but it was the road through which for the last three months
he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the rue de
lhomme arme to the rue des filles du calvaire in order to avoid the
obstructions and the mud in the rue vielle du temple
this road through which cosette had passed excluded for him all
jean valjean entered his lodgings he lighted his candle and mounted
the stairs the apartment was empty even toussaint was no longer there
jean valjeans step made more noise than usual in the chambers all the
cupboards stood open he penetrated to cosettes bedroom there were no
sheets on the bed the pillow covered with ticking and without a case
or lace was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress
whose covering was visible and on which no one was ever to sleep again
all the little feminine objects which cosette was attached to had been
carried away nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four
walls toussaints bed was despoiled in like manner one bed only was
made up and seemed to be waiting some one and this was jean valjeans
jean valjean looked at the walls closed some of the cupboard doors and
went and came from one room to another
then he sought his own chamber once more and set his candle on a table
he had disengaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as
he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance was it
intentionally on the inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on
the little portmanteau which never left him on his arrival in the rue
de lhomme arme on the 4th of june he had deposited it on a round
table near the head of his bed he went to this table with a sort of
vivacity took a key from his pocket and opened the valise
from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before
cosette had quitted montfermeil first the little gown then the black
fichu then the stout coarse childs shoes which cosette might almost
have worn still so tiny were her feet then the fustian bodice which
was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets
then the woollen stockings these stockings which still preserved the
graceful form of a tiny leg were no longer than jean valjeans hand
all this was black of hue it was he who had brought those garments to
montfermeil for her as he removed them from the valise he laid them on
the bed he fell to thinking he called up memories it was in winter
in a very cold month of december she was shivering half naked in
rags her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes he jean
valjean had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these
mourning habiliments the mother must have felt pleased in her grave to
see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that
she was properly clothed and that she was warm he thought of that
forest of montfermeil they had traversed it together cosette and he
he thought of what the weather had been of the leafless trees of the
wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was
charming he arranged the tiny garments on the bed the fichu next to
the petticoat the stockings beside the shoes and he looked at them
one after the other she was no taller than that she had her big doll
in her arms she had put her louis dor in the pocket of that apron she
had laughed they walked hand in hand she had no one in the world but
then his venerable white head fell forward on the bed that stoical old
heart broke his face was engulfed so to speak in cosettes garments
and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have
the old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed so
jacob struggled with the angel but one night alas how many times have
we beheld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness
unheard of conflict at certain moments the foot slips at other moments
the ground crumbles away underfoot how many times had that conscience
mad for the good clasped and overthrown him how many times had the
truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast how many times hurled
to earth by the light had he begged for mercy how many times had
that implacable spark lighted within him and upon him by the bishop
dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind how many times
had he risen to his feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning
against sophism dragged in the dust now getting the upper hand of his
conscience again overthrown by it how many times after an equivoque
after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard
his irritated conscience cry in his ear a trip you wretch how many
times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat
under the evidence of duty resistance to god funereal sweats what
secret wounds which he alone felt bleed what excoriations in his
lamentable existence how many times he had risen bleeding bruised
broken enlightened despair in his heart serenity in his soul
and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror and after having
dislocated broken and rent his conscience with red hot pincers it had
said to him as it stood over him formidable luminous and tranquil
but on emerging from so melancholy a conflict what a lugubrious peace
nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through
predestinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight
avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable
alleys obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many
ways jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of
he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil he had that
gloomy intersection beneath his eyes on this occasion once more as had
happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out
before him the one tempting the other alarming
he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index
finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness
once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the
is it then true the soul may recover but not fate frightful thing an
this is the problem which presented itself to him
in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness
of cosette and marius it was he who had willed that happiness it was
he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails
and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the
sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing
his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his
cosette had marius marius possessed cosette they had everything even
but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that
it existed now that it was there should he force himself on this
happiness should he treat it as belonging to him no doubt cosette did
belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all
that he could retain should he remain the sort of father half seen but
respected which he had hitherto been should he without saying a
word bring his past to that future should he present himself there
as though he had a right and should he seat himself veiled at that
luminous fireside should he take those innocent hands into his tragic
hands with a smile should he place upon the peaceful fender of the
gillenormand drawing room those feet of his which dragged behind them
the disgraceful shadow of the law should he enter into participation in
the fair fortunes of cosette and marius should he render the obscurity
on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense should he
place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity should he
continue to hold his peace in a word should he be the sinister mute of
we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in
order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear
to us in all their horrible nakedness good or evil stands behind
this severe interrogation point what are you going to do demands the
this habit of trial jean valjean possessed he gazed intently at the
he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects
cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck what
was he to do to cling fast to it or to let go his hold
if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend
again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his
garments and his hair he was saved he should live
thus he took sad council with his thoughts or to speak more correctly
he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now
happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep that relieved
him possibly but the beginning was savage a tempest more furious
than the one which had formerly driven him to arras broke loose within
him the past surged up before him facing the present he compared
them and sobbed the silence of tears once opened the despairing man
he felt that he had been stopped short
alas in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when
we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal bewildered
furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping
for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister
resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear
to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle
then one is never done with conscience make your choice brutus make
your choice cato it is fathomless since it is god one flings into
that well the labor of ones whole life one flings in ones fortune
one flings in ones riches one flings in ones success one flings in
ones liberty or fatherland one flings in ones well being one flings
in ones repose one flings in ones joy more more more empty the
vase tip the urn one must finish by flinging in ones heart
somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells there is a tun like that
is not one pardonable if one at last refuses can the inexhaustible
have any right are not chains which are endless above human strength
who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying it is enough
the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the
obedience of the soul if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual
the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult what was
the champmathieu affair in comparison with cosettes marriage and of
that which it entailed what is a re entrance into the galleys compared
oh first step that must be descended how sombre art thou oh second
how could he refrain from turning aside his head this time
martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation it is a torture which
consecrates one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself
on the throne of glowing iron one places on ones head the crown of hot
iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of
red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned and
comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one
at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion
he weighed he reflected he considered the alternatives the mysterious
should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children or should
he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself on one side lay
the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself
at what solution should he arrive what decision did he come to
what resolution did he take what was his own inward definitive response
to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality what door did he decide to
open which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning
among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was
his choice what extremity did he accept to which of the gulfs did he
he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over
that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance
alas with clenched fists with arms outspread at right angles like a
man crucified who has been un nailed and flung face down on the earth
there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long
winters night ice cold without once raising his head and without
uttering a word he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts
wallowed on the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the
eagle any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him
dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and his mouth glued to
cosettes garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was
who could see since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there

the days that follow weddings are solitary people respect the
meditations of the happy pair and also their tardy slumbers to some
degree the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on
on the morning of the 17th of february it was a little past midday when
basque with napkin and feather duster under his arm busy in setting
his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door there had been
no ring which was discreet on such a day basque opened the door and
beheld m fauchelevent he introduced him into the drawing room still
encumbered and topsy turvy and which bore the air of a field of battle
dame sir remarked basque we all woke up late
which one the old one or the new one
monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up
a man is a baron most of all to his servants he counts for something
with them they are what a philosopher would call bespattered with the
title and that flatters them marius be it said in passing a militant
republican as he had proved was now a baron in spite of himself a
small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with
this title it was now m gillenormand who clung to it and marius who
detached himself from it but colonel pontmercy had written my son
will bear my title marius obeyed and then cosette in whom the woman
was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness
monsieur le baron repeated basque i will go and see i will tell
no do not tell him that it is i tell him that some one wishes to
speak to him in private and mention no name
ah ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah as an
the drawing room as we have just said was in great disorder it seemed
as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of
the wedding on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which
had fallen from garlands and head dresses the wax candles burned
to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the
chandeliers not a single piece of furniture was in its place in the
corners three or four arm chairs drawn close together in a circle
had the appearance of continuing a conversation the whole effect was
cheerful a certain grace still lingers round a dead feast it has been
a happy thing on the chairs in disarray among those fading flowers
beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy the sun
had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the
several minutes elapsed jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where
basque had left him he was very pale his eyes were hollow and so
sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in
their orbits his black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that
has been up all night the elbows were whitened with the down which the
friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it
jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his
there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes
marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable
light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant he had
it is you father he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean
that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air but you have come too
early it is only half past twelve cosette is asleep
that word father said to m fauchelevent by marius signified
supreme felicity there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty
wall a coldness and a constraint between them ice which must be broken
or melted marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall
was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m fauchelevent was to
he continued his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine
how glad i am to see you if you only knew how we missed you yesterday
good morning father how is your hand better is it not
and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he
we have both been talking about you cosette loves you so dearly you
must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to
do with the rue de lhomme arme we will have no more of it at all how
could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is
disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one
is cold and into which one cannot enter you are to come and install
yourself here and this very day or you will have to deal with cosette
she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you you have your own
chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble
with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is all ready
you have only to take possession of it near your bed cosette has placed
a huge old easy chair covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to
it stretch out your arms to him a nightingale comes to the clump of
acacias opposite your windows every spring in two months more you will
have it you will have its nest on your left and ours on your right by
night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle your chamber faces
due south cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of
captain cook and the other vancouvers and all your affairs i believe
that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed
upon a corner of honor for that you have conquered my grandfather you
suit him we will live together do you play whist you will overwhelm
my grandfather with delight if you play whist it is you who shall take
cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her
your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg we are absolutely
resolved to be happy and you shall be included in it in our happiness
do you hear father come will you breakfast with us to day
sir said jean valjean i have something to say to you i am an
the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped as well in
the case of the mind as in that of the ear these words i am an
ex convict proceeding from the mouth of m fauchelevent and entering
the ear of marius overshot the possible it seemed to him that something
had just been said to him but he did not know what he stood with his
then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful
wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment
jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm
unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it
there is nothing the matter with my hand said he
there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean
there was in fact no trace of any injury
it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage i absented
myself as much as was in my power so i invented this injury in order
that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw
into the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing
the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the
you are driving me mad exclaimed marius in terror
monsieur pontmercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the
galleys for theft then i was condemned for life for theft for a
second offence at the present moment i have broken my ban
in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist
the evidence he was forced to give way he began to understand and as
always happens in such cases he understood too much an inward shudder
of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him
quiver traversed his mind he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for
say all say all he cried you are cosettes father
and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable
jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he
it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our oath
to others may not be received in law   
here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority
he added articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables
   you will believe me i the father of cosette before god no
monsieur le baron pontmercy i am a peasant of faverolles i earned my
living by pruning trees my name is not fauchelevent but jean valjean
i am not related to cosette reassure yourself
marius looked at the man he was melancholy yet tranquil no lie could
proceed from such a calm that which is icy is sincere the truth could
be felt in that chill of the tomb
jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and
what am i to cosette a passer by ten years ago i did not know that
she was in existence i love her it is true one loves a child whom one
has seen when very young being old oneself when one is old one feels
oneself a grandfather towards all little children you may it seems to
