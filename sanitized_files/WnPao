clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his face
gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short
man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince
andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidently
expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew did
neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned
away and went down the side of the corridor
he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of men the
minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such men
as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a sigh he
could not suppress as they passed out of the palace
next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of
austerlitz boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukov
again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment
at dawn on the sixteenth of november denisovs squadron in which
nicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagrations detachment
moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action
as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirds
of a mile was stopped on the highroad rostov saw the cossacks and then
the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and
artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration and
dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before action
which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to
conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true
hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in
reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood
at nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah
and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at
last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in
convoyed by a sotnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over and
though not big had been a successful engagement the men and officers
returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of
wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was bright
and sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that
autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed
not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by the
joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and
adjutants as they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who had
vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that
happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed
come here wostov lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisov
who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food
the officers gathered round denisovs canteen eating and talking
there they are bringing another cried one of the officers
indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had
sell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacks
the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner the
french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german
accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he
heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers
addressing first one then another he said he would not have been
taken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to seize
some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there and at
every word he added but dont hurt my little horse and stroked the
animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was now he
excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining
himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline
and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the
freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to us
the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being the
richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it
but dont hurt my little horse said the alsatian good naturedly to
rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar
rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money
alley alley said the cossack touching the prisoners arm to make
the emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars
all began to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road behind
him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyone
rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted
instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of
himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to
the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longed for moment of
meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he
was ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from the
sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew
near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more
festive around him nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun shedding
beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself
enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and
majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with rostovs
feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the
the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to that
the emperor drew level with rostov and halted alexanders face was even
more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review it
shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteen year old boy and yet it was the face of
the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the
emperors eyes met rostovs and rested on them for not more than two
seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in
rostovs soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everything at
any rate his light blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into rostovs
face a gentle mild light poured from them then all at once he raised
his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot and
the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve
oclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward
the vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met
him with news of the successful result of the action
this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was
represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor
and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the
battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and were
retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had
passed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau
itself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in the market
place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
emperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite of
officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head the
wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity
to the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the emperors rather round
shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his left
foot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur and how
the well trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir an
adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on
a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned
gently gently cant you do it more gently said the emperor
apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away
rostov saw tears filling the emperors eyes and heard him as he was
riding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what a
terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre
the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight
of the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the
least firing the emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguard
rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodka
the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more
merrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated his promotion to
the rank of major and rostov who had already drunk enough at the end
of the feast proposed the emperors health not our sovereign the
emperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health of
our sovereign that good enchanting and great man let us drink to his
health and to the certain defeat of the french
if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as at
schon grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we will
all die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying
it right i have drunk a good deal but that is how i feel and so do
you too to the health of alexander the first hurrah
hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers
and the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no
less sincerely than the twenty year old rostov
when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten filled
others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the
soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest
showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light
lads heres to our sovereign the emperor and victory over our
enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old hussars baritone
the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts
late that night when all had separated denisov with his short hand
as theres no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen in love
denisov dont make fun of it cried rostov it is such a lofty
i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove
and rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of
what happiness it would be to die not in saving the emperors life he
did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyes
he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian arms
and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in
love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the
the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physician
was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops
near by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and
had slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of this
indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
at daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with a
flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was
brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary the
emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday
he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with
prince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french army
it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a
meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army a
personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince
dolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate
with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were
toward evening dolgorukov came back went straight to the tsar and
remained alone with him for a long time
on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two
days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shots
retreated in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth a
great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning
of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought
till midday on the nineteenth the activity the eager talk running to
and fro and dispatching of adjutants was confined to the emperors
headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached
kutuzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns by
evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army
and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eighty
thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices
and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long
the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperors headquarters
in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like
the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock one wheel
slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began
to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to
play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion
just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military
machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to
them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a
neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever
catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken
just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands
which show the time so the result of all the complicated human
activities of 160000 russians and french all their passions desires
remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and
enthusiasm was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the so called
battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow movement of the
prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
at six in the evening kutuzov went to the emperors headquarters and
after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand
bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
coming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upset and
dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
dissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarters
everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov
well how dyou do my dear fellow said dolgorukov who was sitting
at tea with bilibin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellow
i wont say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be heard
but they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte
fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible
yes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is bonaparte
yes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
general engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing this general
conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon if
he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview why
negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to
his method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a
general battle his hour has come mark my words
but tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew again
he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him
your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me thats
the sort of man he is and nothing more replied dolgorukov looking
despite my great respect for old kutuzov he continued we should be
a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance
to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands
no we mustnt forget suvorov and his rule not to put yourself in a
position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the
energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience
but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the
outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
he wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself
oh that is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting up he
spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if he
and prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothers
prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might have
been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage that weyrothers
had already been approved as soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate
the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan prince
dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly not at the
there will be a council of war at kutuzovs tonight though you can
i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map
whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin who till
then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now
was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory or
defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutuzov
there is not a single russian in command of a column the commanders
are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de
lichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on
be quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true there are now
two russians miloradovich and dokhturov and there would be a third
count arakcheev if his nerves were not too weak
however i think general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew i
wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out after
on the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzov
who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrows
kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied i
think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstoy and asked him
to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my dear
general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters
yourself yes that was the answer i got
shortly after nine oclock that evening weyrother drove with his plans
to kutuzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held all the
commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chiefs and with
the exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all there
weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be
at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was
like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he was
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at
headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
to weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line to
reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrian
to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated the
dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived at
he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly
without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to
questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful
weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and
kutuzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions near
ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in
chiefs office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and the members
of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited prince
bagration to begin the council at last bagrations orderly came with
the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in to
inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself of
permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the council
since prince bagration is not coming we may begin said weyrother
hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an
enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread out
kutuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair
with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound
of weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effort
yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding his
head he let it droop and again closed his eye
if at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov was
pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed
by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the
dispositions or anything else he was engaged in satisfying the
irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with
the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutuzov and
having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a
loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
impending battle under a heading which he also read out
dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and
the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as
as the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends
along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while we
on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it is
advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially if we occupy
the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his
flank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and the
thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz
which cover the enemys front for this object it is necessary that
the first column marches the second column marches the third
the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions
the tall fair haired general buxhowden stood leaning his back against
the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother
with his glistening wide open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
twisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose his
elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders
raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrothers face and
only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished
reading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the other
generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next
to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left
his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading
gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a
gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the
longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised
his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the
austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his
elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with an
expression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seeking an
explanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gaze
drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox
a geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to
przebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand
to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in
attention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother with an
assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map
conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he
asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkturov
when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again
brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at
anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out
such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known
whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement
langerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim
was to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions with as
much self confidence as if he were addressing school children that he
had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in
when the monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutuzov opened
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking so
you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and
langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers vanity
as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easily
attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this plan
perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
if he could attack us he would have done so today said he
so you think he is powerless said langeron
he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smile
of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a
in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said
langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support
but miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
rather than of what the generals were disputing about
ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield
weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to
have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but
the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
his camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating which
is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position he
smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in the
thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same
how is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting an
kutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals
gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrow or rather for today for it
is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have heard them
and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more
important he paused than to have a good sleep
he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was past
the council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to express
his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy
impression whether dolgorukov and weyrother or kutuzov langeron and
the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were right he did
not know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to state his views
plainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court and
personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life my
yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thought
and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distant
most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his last
parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he
first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and
for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out
of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and began to walk up
the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more none
of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly
i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i
can do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentration
of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders and
then that happy moment that toulon for which he had so long waited
presents itself to him at last he firmly and clearly expresses his
opinion to kutuzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck by
the justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out so
he takes a regiment a division stipulates that no one is to interfere
with his arrangements leads his division to the decisive point and
gains the victory alone but death and suffering suggested another
voice prince andrew however did not answer that voice and went on
dreaming of his triumphs the dispositions for the next battle are
planned by him alone nominally he is only an adjutant on kutuzovs
staff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by him
alone kutuzov is removed and he is appointed well and then asked
the other voice if before that you are not ten times wounded killed
or betrayed well what then well then prince andrew answered
himself i dont know what will happen and dont want to know and
cant but if i want this want glory want to be known to men want to
be loved by them it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but
that and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tell
anyone but oh god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and
mens esteem death wounds the loss of family i fear nothing and
precious and dear as many persons are to me father sister wife those
dearest to me yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them
all at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men
i dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here he
thought as he listened to voices in kutuzovs courtyard the voices
were those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably a
coachmans was teasing kutuzovs old cook whom prince andrew knew and
who was called tit he was saying tit i say tit
go tit thresh a bit said the wag
oh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter of
all the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all i
value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
that same night rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
of bagrations detachment his hussars were placed along the line in
couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our armys
campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in front
of him was misty darkness rostov could see nothing peer as he would
into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there was
something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
ought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes his
eyes kept closing and in his fancy appeared now the emperor now
denisov and now moscow memories and he again hurriedly opened his eyes
and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding
and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figures
of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness why
not it might easily happen thought rostov that the emperor will
meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer hell
say go and find out whats there there are many stories of his
getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him
to himself what if he gave me a place near him oh how i would guard
him how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask his deceivers
and in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign
rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he would
not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before
the emperor suddenly a distant shout aroused him he started and opened
where am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and watchword
shaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve
tomorrow he thought ill ask leave to go to the front this may be
my only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be long now before i am
off duty ill take another turn and when i get back ill go to the
general and ask him he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up
his horse to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to him that it
was getting lighter to the left he saw a sloping descent lit up and
facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall on this knoll
there was a white patch that rostov could not at all make out was it a
glade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or some
white houses he even thought something moved on that white spot i
expect its snow that spot a spot une tache he thought there
now its not a tache natasha sister black eyes na
tasha wont she be surprised when i tell her how ive seen the
emperor natasha take my sabretache keep to the right your
honor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whom
rostov was riding in the act of falling asleep rostov lifted his head
that had sunk almost to his horses mane and pulled up beside the
hussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish
drowsiness but what was i thinking i mustnt forget how shall i
speak to the emperor no thats not it thats tomorrow oh yes
natasha sabretache saber them whom the hussars ah the
hussars with mustaches along the tverskaya street rode the hussar with
mustaches i thought about him too just opposite guryevs house
old guryev oh but denisovs a fine fellow but thats all nonsense
the chief thing is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and
wished to say something but dared not no it was i who dared not
but thats nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important
thing i was thinking of yes na tasha sabretache oh yes yes thats
right and his head once more sank to his horses neck all at once it
seemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cut them
down what said rostov waking up at the moment he opened his eyes
he heard in front of him where the enemy was the long drawn shouts of
thousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussar near him
pricked their ears at these shouts over there where the shouting came
from a fire flared up and went out again then another and all along
the french line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder
and louder rostov could hear the sound of french words but could not
distinguish them the din of many voices was too great all he could
whats that what do you make of it said rostov to the hussar beside
why dont you hear it rostov asked again after waiting for a reply
who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly
from the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostov
it may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar its dark
rostovs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of
several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther and
farther probably along the line of the french camp rostov no longer
wanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
stimulating effect on him vive lempereur lempereur he now heard
they cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to the
the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the sound
of horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
heard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
your honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostov
rostov still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with
the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line
one was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov with
their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights
and shouts in the enemys camp rostov rode up to bagration reported to
him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were
believe me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration it is
nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us
hardly said bagration i saw them this evening on that knoll if
they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too officer
said bagration to rostov are the enemys skirmishers still there
they were there this evening but now i dont know your excellency
shall i go with some of my hussars to see replied rostov
bagration stopped and before replying tried to see rostovs face in
well go and see he said after a pause
rostov spurred his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two other
hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction
from which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to be
riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
distance where no one had been before him bagration called to him from
the hill not to go beyond the stream but rostov pretended not to hear
him and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes
for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes
having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or
the enemys fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly and
distinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a river but
when he reached it he found it was a road having come out onto the road
he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it
and ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to the road which
gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be
easier to see people coming along it follow me said he crossed the
road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where
the french pickets had been standing that evening
your honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him and
before rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had
suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a report
and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
out of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan
rostov turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed at
intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones rostov reined in his horse whose spirits had risen
like his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well some
more some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no more
only when approaching bagration did rostov let his horse gallop again
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general
dolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had
what does that prove he was saying as rostov rode up they might
its plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagration
wait till tomorrow morning well find out everything tomorrow
the picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was in
the evening reported rostov stooping forward with his hand at the
salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride
and especially by the sound of the bullets
very good very good said bagration thank you officer
your excellency said rostov may i ask a favor
tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached to
oh very well you may stay in attendance on me
then i may reckon on it your excellency
tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor
the fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the fact
that while napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops the
emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing him
lit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive lempereur
soldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
austrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke at
hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place the position we
occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on
the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct
your battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor
carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victory
be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor exposing
himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt of
victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of
the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation
do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let every
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
of england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will
conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh
french troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peace
i shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself
at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the
center the reserves and bagrations right flank had not yet moved but
on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which
were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right
flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan were
already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they were
throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was cold and
dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the
soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm
themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds of
the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a
commanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiers
ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into
the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officers
buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved
along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and
packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and
instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remained
behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded the
column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses
around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place
they were leaving or that to which they were going
a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whatever
strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is
always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so
the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the
same sergeant major ivan mitrich the same company dog jack and the
same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
his ship is sailing but on the day of battle heaven knows how and
whence a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and
solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning
the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might
encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced for
a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills
avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and
nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers became
aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns
were moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that
to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going
there now the kurskies have also gone past was being said in the
its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last night
i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular
though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of
humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves
to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops
marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to
an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such a
consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it
certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly
and irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army been
alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as
it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up
no one cant hear them theyd be firing if we had
they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in the
middle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damned
yes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding up
i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the
ah those damned germans they dont know their own country said
what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up
then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you wont
what stupid orders they dont themselves know what they are doing
then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian
tafa lafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said a
