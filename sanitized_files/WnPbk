with a serious face asked sonya who was considered an excellent reader
the enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces he
sonya read painstakingly in her high pitched voice the count listened
with closed eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages
natasha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father and
pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round the countess
shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in
the manifesto in all these words she saw only that the danger
threatening her son would not soon be over shinshin with a sarcastic
smile on his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that
gave him the opportunity sonyas reading any remark of the counts or
even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself
after reading about the dangers that threatened russia the hopes the
emperor placed on moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility
sonya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was
being paid to her read the last words
we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that capital
and in other parts of our realm for consultation and for the direction
of all our levies both those now barring the enemys path and those
freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the ruin he
hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may europe delivered
yes thats it cried the count opening his moist eyes and sniffing
repeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose and he
added let the emperor but say the word and well sacrifice everything
before shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
counts patriotism natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her
what a darling our papa is she cried kissing him and she again
looked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
there heres a patriot for you said shinshin
not a patriot at all but simply natasha replied in an injured
tone everything seems funny to you but this isnt at all a joke
a joke indeed put in the count let him but say the word and well
but did you notice it says for consultation said pierre
at this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came up
to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
well papa i tell you definitely and mamma too its as you please
but i say definitely that you must let me enter the army because i
the countess in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her hands and
but the count had already recovered from his excitement
come come said he heres a fine warrior no nonsense you must
its not nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and hes
going too besides all the same i cant study now when petya
stopped short flushed till he perspired but still got out the words
but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything
petya be quiet i tell you cried the count with a glance at his
wife who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son
and i tell you peter kirilych here will also tell you
nonsense i tell you your mothers milk has hardly dried on your lips
and you want to go into the army there there i tell you and the
count moved to go out of the room taking the papers probably to reread
them in his study before having a nap
well peter kirilych lets go and have a smoke he said
pierre was agitated and undecided natashas unwontedly brilliant eyes
continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look had reduced
home why you meant to spend the evening with us you dont often
come nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count good
naturedly pointing to natasha only brightens up when youre here
yes i had forgotten i really must go home business said
well then au revoir said the count and went out of the room
why are you going why are you upset asked natasha and she looked
because i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say it
and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes
because it is better for me to come less often because no simply
why no tell me natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped
they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he tried
to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silently
pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs any more
after the definite refusal he had received petya went to his room and
there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea
silent morose and with tear stained face everybody pretended not to
next day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovs
domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him that
morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar
to look like a grown up man he frowned before his looking glass
gesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a word
to anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying to
avoid notice petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and
to explain frankly to some gentleman in waiting he imagined the emperor
to be always surrounded by gentlemen in waiting that he count rostov
in spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could be
no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressing
petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman in
it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for success
in reaching the emperor he even thought how surprised everyone would be
at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown up man
but the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the
ever increasing crowds moving toward the kremlin the less he remembered
to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approached
the kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
out his elbows in a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was
so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
determination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed in
rumbling beneath the archway beside petya stood a peasant woman a
footman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some
time in the gateway petya tried to move forward in front of the others
without waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutely
working his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him who
was the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted at
what are you shoving for young lordling dont you see were all
anybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbows
to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of the
petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a mans
he felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he were
now to approach the gentlemen in waiting in that plight he would not be
admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up or
move to another place because of the crowd one of the generals who
drove past was an acquaintance of the rostovs and petya thought of
asking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd
carrying petya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square which
was already full of people there were people not only in the square
but everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs as soon as petya found
himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous
voices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlin
for a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were bared
and everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed so
that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrah
hurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see
all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a
tradesmans wife standing beside petya sobbed and the tears ran down
father angel dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tears
for a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush
quite beside himself petya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
ferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah as
if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else but
on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
so this is what the emperor is thought petya no i cant petition
him myself that would be too bold but in spite of this he continued
to struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those in
front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth
spread out on it but just then the crowd swayed back the police in
front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the
procession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of
the assumption and petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side
and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim
before his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to himself a
man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his
head and wearing a shabby blue cassock probably a church clerk and
chanter was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
the pressure of the crowd with the other
youve crushed the young gentleman said the clerk what are you up
the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread
out again more evenly and the clerk led petya pale and breathless to
the tsar cannon several people were sorry for petya and suddenly a
crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood nearest
him attended to him unbuttoned his coat seated him on the raised
platform of the cannon and reproached those others whoever they might
one might easily get killed that way what do they mean by it killing
people poor dear hes as white as a sheet various voices were heard
petya soon came to himself the color returned to his face the pain had
passed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would
be returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting his
petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy
while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumption it
was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperors
arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turks
the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvas
gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which petya was particularly
fond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a tradesmans
wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had
cost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerk
who had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
were officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times used
the word plenary of the service a word petya did not understand
two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
nuts all these conversations especially the joking with the girls
were such as might have had a particular charm for petya at his age but
they did not interest him now he sat on his elevation the pedestal of
the cannon still agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and
by his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had experienced
when he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further
intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion
suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment
to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushed
impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing petya too would
have run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under
his protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding when
officers generals and gentlemen in waiting came running out of the
cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps were
again raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
again at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
cathedral doors hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd again
which is he which asked petya in a tearful voice of those around
him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and petya
fixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for the
tears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on
him though it happened not to be the emperor frantically shouted
hurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the
the crowd ran after the emperor followed him to the palace and began
to disperse it was already late and petya had not eaten anything and
was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood with
that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the palace while
the emperor dined looking in at the palace windows expecting he knew
not what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
to dine with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table
glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows
while the emperor was dining valuev looking out of the window said
the people are still hoping to see your majesty again
the dinner was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit rose
and went out onto the balcony the people with petya among them rushed
angel dear one hurrah father cried the crowd and petya with
it and again the women and men of weaker mold petya among them wept
a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand broke
off fell on the balcony parapet and then to the ground a coachman in
a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several
people in the crowd rushed at the coachman seeing this the emperor had
a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the
balcony petyas eyes grew bloodshot and still more excited by the
danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know why
but he had to have a biscuit from the tsars hand and he felt that he
must not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated
though she was lying on the ground she grabbed at some biscuits but her
hand did not reach them petya pushed her hand away with his knee
seized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shouted
the emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd began
there i said if only we waited and so it was was being joyfully
happy as petya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home from the
kremlin but called on his friend obolenski who was fifteen and was
also entering the regiment on returning home petya announced resolutely
and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run
away and next day count ilya rostov though he had not yet quite
yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve where
two days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of carriages
the great halls were full in the first were the nobility and gentry in
their uniforms in the second bearded merchants in full skirted coats of
blue cloth and wearing medals in the noblemens hall there was an
incessant movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on high
backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor but
most of the gentry were strolling about the room
all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in their own
houses were in uniform some in that of catherines day others in that
of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of alexanders time or
the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic of
being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these
diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old men
dim eyed toothless bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkled
were especially striking for the most part they sat quietly in their
places and were silent or if they walked about and talked attached
themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of
the crowd petya had seen in the square there was a striking
contradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at the
same time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cook
pierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in a noblemans
uniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated this
extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant
class les etats generaux states general evoked in him a whole series
of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his
soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution the
words that had struck him in the emperors appeal that the sovereign
was coming to the capital for consultation with his people strengthened
this idea and imagining that in this direction something important
which he had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watching
and listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of
the emperors manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all moved
about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierre
heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the emperors honor
whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
provinces and so on but as soon as the war was touched on or what
the nobility had been convened for the talk became undecided and
a middle aged man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired
naval officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd was
pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
the speaker and listened count ilya rostov in a military uniform of
catherines time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd
with all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group and
listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did to
what the speaker was saying the retired naval man was speaking very
boldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners
and from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest and
quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement
with him pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listened
and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal but of views
quite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularly
swallowing his rs and generally slurring his consonants the voice of a
man calling out to his servant heah bwing me my pipe it was
indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority
what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the
empewah ah we to take smolensk as our patten if the noble awistocwacy
of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it can show its loyalty to our
sovweign the empewah in other ways have we fogotten the waising of
the militia in the yeah seven all that did was to enwich the pwiests
count ilya rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval
and was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only wuined
our farming bettah have another conscwiption o ou men will wetun
neithah soldiers no peasants and well get only depwavity fwom them
the nobility dont gwudge theah lives evewy one of us will go and bwing
in more wecwuits and the sovweign that was the way he referred to
the emperor need only say the word and well all die fo him added
count rostovs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre but
pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred but
not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had he
opened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in his
head with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the first
speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates and
to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones
i imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that we
have been summoned here not to discuss whether its best for the empire
at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia
we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign
the emperor has honored us but to judge what is best conscription or
the militia we can leave to the supreme authority
pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heart
against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude
into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped forward and
interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but he
began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressing
excuse me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with the
senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him
formally though i dont agree with the gentleman he hesitated
he wished to say mon tres honorable preopinant my very honorable
opponent with the gentleman whom i have not the honor of knowing
i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express
their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we
can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to his
subject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service and
chair a canon  we are ready to make of ourselves and not to obtain
many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the senators sarcastic
smile and the freedom of pierres remarks only count rostov was pleased
with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer the
senator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard
i think that before discussing these questions pierre continued we
should ask the emperor most respectfully ask his majesty to let us
know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our
but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from
three sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance a
boston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepan
stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a result
of the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a
different man with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face
in the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperor
about that and secondly if the russian nobility had that right the
emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according
to the enemys movements and the number of men increases and
another voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
of age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a bad
cardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to pierre
yes and this is not a time for discussing he continued but for
acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy
russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wives
and children the nobleman smote his breast we will all arise every
one of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted rolling his
bloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in the crowd we
are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith the
throne and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of our
fatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of
pierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that his
words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than the
count rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several
persons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his
serfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order
to be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voices
shouted and talked at the same time so that count rostov had not time
to signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersed
re formed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
to the big table not only was pierres attempt to speak unsuccessful
but he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away from
him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were
displeased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgotten
after the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed a
tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate pierre became the
latter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all in
the same tone many spoke eloquently and with originality
glinka the editor of the russian messenger who was recognized cries
of author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must be
repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
flashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that child
yes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rows
the crowd drew up to the large table at which sat gray haired or bald
seventy year old magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whom
pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playing
boston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the
chairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together
those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened
to supply it others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierre
knew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and their
faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
hot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that
they were ready to go to all lengths which found expression in the
tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches infected him
too he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way to
i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
when we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above the
one of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention was
immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table
yes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted
he is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak
at that moment count rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes
wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder entered
the room stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry
our sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment said rostopchin
i am straight from the palace seeing the position we are in i think
there is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summon
us and the merchants millions will pour forth from there he pointed
to the merchants hall but our business is to supply men and not spare
ourselves that is the least we can do
a conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table
the whole consultation passed more than quietly after all the preceding
noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another i agree
or for variety i too am of that opinion and so on had even a
the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow
nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully equipped
out of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had done their
chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
with apparent relief and began walking up and down arm in arm to
the emperor the emperor a sudden cry resounded through the halls and
the emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of
nobles every face expressed respectful awe struck curiosity pierre
stood rather far off and could not hear all that the emperor said from
what he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the danger
threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscow
nobility he was answered by a voice which informed him of the
gentlemen said the emperor with a quivering voice
there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so that
pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the emperor saying
i never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles but today it has
surpassed my expectations i thank you in the name of the fatherland
gentlemen let us act time is most precious
the emperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing round him and
yes most precious a royal word said count rostov with a sob he
stood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything understood
from the hall of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchants
there he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those who saw him
come out from the merchants hall with tears of emotion in his eyes as
became known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice
when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two
merchants one of whom pierre knew a fat otkupshchik the other was the
mayor a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard both were
weeping tears filled the thin mans eyes and the fat otkupshchik
sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating
our lives and property take them your majesty
pierres one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he now
felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
an opportunity of effacing it having heard that count mamonov was
furnishing a regiment bezukhov at once informed rostopchin that he
would give a thousand men and their maintenance
old rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears and
at once consented to petyas request and went himself to enter his name
next day the emperor left moscow the assembled nobles all took off
their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs and not
without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment
feeling amazed themselves at what they had done
napoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going to
dresden could not help having his head turned by the homage he
received could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the
stimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain from
bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashev
alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way
because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great
commander rostov charged the french because he could not restrain his
wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way the
innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their
personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were
moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imagining
that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will
but they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a work
concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitable
fate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy
the actors of 1812 have long since left the stage their personal
interests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of that
providence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims to
further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
expected neither napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of those
the cause of the destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us
now no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance
into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for
a winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war by
the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
among the russian people but no one at the time foresaw what now seems
so evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
men the best in the world and led by the best general could be
destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength
and led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only
did no one see this but on the russian side every effort was made to
hinder the only thing that could save russia while on the french side
despite napoleons experience and so called military genius every
effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer
that is to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction
in historical works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of
saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line that he
sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk
and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling us
that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was
adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan some
of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchman others to
toll and others again to alexander himself pointing to notes
projects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but
all these hints at what happened both from the french side and the
russian are advanced only because they fit in with the event had that
event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we have
forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the
contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the
event falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the
issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people
to say i said then that it would be so quite forgetting that amid
their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect
conjectures as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending his
line and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depths
of russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining can
historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals or
such plans to the russian commanders all the facts are in flat
contradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the war
not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into
the heart of the country but from their first entry into russia
everything was done to stop them and not only was napoleon not afraid
to extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazily
at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our sole
aim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country our
emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian
soil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuels
plan and there was no intention of retiring farther the emperor
reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he could
not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk still less
could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did
unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a
general engagement having been fought under its walls
so thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people were still
more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at
smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we now
see that advance was evidently ruinous to him
the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
advance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders then
think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of
napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan
for no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complex
interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part in
the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the one
way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armies
were divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite
them with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the
enemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle
with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an
acute angle we led the french on to smolensk but we withdrew at an
acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies
the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther because
barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration who
would come under his command and bagration being in command of the
second army tried to postpone joining up and coming under barclays
command as long as he could bagration was slow in effecting the
junction though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters because
as he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it was
best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worrying
the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for
his army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under
the command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior
the emperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence and
ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers and
plans destroyed the first armys energy and it retired
the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci
aiming at becoming commander in chief unexpectedly employed his energy
to influence alexander and pfuels whole plan was abandoned and the
command entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence
his power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity of
command and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion division
and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief there resulted
on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could
not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else
instead of barclay been in command and on the other an ever increasing
indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal
at last the emperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeed
the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow
the strength of the russian army was trebled
he left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefs undivided
control of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then be
taken but the command of the armies became still more confused and
enfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of adjutants general
remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation
and arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than ever under
the observation of all these eyes of the emperor became still more
cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle
barclay stood for caution the tsarevich hinted at treachery and
demanded a general engagement lubomirski bronnitski wlocki and the
others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under
pretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polish
adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
at smolensk the armies at last reunited much as bagration disliked it
bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay
barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
despite his seniority in rank bagration in this contest of magnanimity
took his orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with him
less than ever by the emperors orders bagration reported direct to
him he wrote to arakcheev the emperors confidant it must be as my
sovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaning
barclay for gods sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a
regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germans
that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thought
i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out
that i am serving barclay i confess i do not want to
the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further
embittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even less
unity resulted preparations were made to fight the french before
smolensk a general was sent to survey the position this general
hating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a corps commander
and having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemned
as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had not
while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
battle and while we were looking for the french having lost touch with
them the french stumbled upon neverovskis division and reached the
it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our
lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed
smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the
whole people but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants who had
been misled by their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting an
example to other russians went to moscow thinking only of their own
losses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther and we
retired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction
the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess mary
well are you satisfied now said he youve made me quarrel with my
son satisfied are you thats all you wanted satisfied it hurts
me it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted well then
after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he was
princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old
prince not only excluded her from his room but did not admit
at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
of life devoting himself with special activity to building operations
and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his
daughter seemed to say there you see you plotted against me you
lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made
me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you
princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching his
lessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking to
dessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her old
nurse or with gods folk who sometimes came by the back door to see
of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars she
feared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at the
strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did not
understand the significance of this war which seemed to her like all
previous wars she did not realize the significance of this war though
dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her
and though the gods folk who came to see her reported in their own
way the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist
and though julie now princess drubetskaya who had resumed
correspondence with her wrote patriotic letters from moscow
i write you in russian my good friend wrote julie in her frenchified
russian because i have a detestation for all the french and the same
for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken we in
moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor
my poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns but the
news which i have inspires me yet more
you heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski embracing his two
sons and saying i will perish with them but we will not be shaken
and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we were
unshakable we pass the time as we can but in war as in war the
princesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me and we unhappy
widows of live men make beautiful conversations over our charpie
only you my friend are missing and so on
the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of
this war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognize
it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner the
princes tone was so calm and confident that princess mary
all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated
he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
serfs the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that
he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his study as usual
changed his sleeping place every day one day he would order his camp
bed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained on the
couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
undressing while instead of mademoiselle bourienne a serf boy read to
him then again he would spend a night in the dining room
on august 1 a second letter was received from prince andrew in his
first letter which came soon after he had left home prince andrew had
dutifully asked his fathers forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
to say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the old
prince had replied affectionately and from that time had kept the
frenchwoman at a distance prince andrews second letter written near
vitebsk after the french had occupied that town gave a brief account of
the whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
as to the further progress of the war in this letter prince andrew
pointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills so near
the theater of war and on the armys direct line of march and advised
at dinner that day on dessalles mentioning that the french were said
to have already entered vitebsk the old prince remembered his sons
there was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess mary
no father she replied in a frightened voice
she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
he writes about this war said the prince with the ironic smile that
had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war
that must be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is in a
go and get it for me said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne
you know under the paperweight on the little table
no dont he exclaimed with a frown you go michael ivanovich
michael ivanovich rose and went to the study but as soon as he had left
the room the old prince looking uneasily round threw down his napkin
they cant do anything always make some muddle he muttered
while he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle bourienne and
even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence the old prince returned
with quick steps accompanied by michael ivanovich bringing the letter
