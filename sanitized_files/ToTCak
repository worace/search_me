do you by jupiter said stryver i am sorry for it
why mr darnay dye hear what he did dont ask why in these
then i tell you again mr darnay i am sorry for it i am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions here is a fellow
who infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale and you ask me why i am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him well but ill answer you i am sorry
because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel thats
mindful of the secret darnay with great difficulty checked himself and
i understand how to put you in a corner mr darnay said bully
stryver and ill do it if this fellow is a gentleman i dont
understand him you may tell him so with my compliments you may also
tell him from me that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob i wonder he is not at the head of them but no
gentlemen said stryver looking all round and snapping his fingers
i know something of human nature and i tell you that youll never
find a fellow like this fellow trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious protgs no gentlemen hell always show em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle and sneak away
with those words and a final snap of his fingers mr stryver
shouldered himself into fleet street amidst the general approbation of
his hearers mr lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk
will you take charge of the letter said mr lorry you know where to
will you undertake to explain that we suppose it to have been
addressed here on the chance of our knowing where to forward it and
i will do so do you start for paris from here
i will come back to see you off
very ill at ease with himself and with stryver and most other men
darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple opened the
letter and read it these were its contents
after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village i have been seized with great violence and indignity and
brought a long journey on foot to paris on the road i have suffered a
great deal nor is that all my house has been destroyed razed to the
the crime for which i am imprisoned monsieur heretofore the marquis
and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal and shall lose my
life without your so generous help is they tell me treason against
the majesty of the people in that i have acted against them for an
emigrant it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them and not
against according to your commands it is in vain i represent that
before the sequestration of emigrant property i had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay that i had collected no rent that i had
had recourse to no process the only response is that i have acted for
ah most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis where is that
emigrant i cry in my sleep where is he i demand of heaven will he
not come to deliver me no answer ah monsieur heretofore the marquis
i send my desolate cry across the sea hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris
for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of the honour of
your noble name i supplicate you monsieur heretofore the marquis to
succour and release me my fault is that i have been true to you oh
monsieur heretofore the marquis i pray you be you true to me
from this prison here of horror whence i every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction i send you monsieur heretofore the marquis the
the latent uneasiness in darnays mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter the peril of an old servant and a good one whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him so
reproachfully in the face that as he walked to and fro in the temple
considering what to do he almost hid his face from the passersby
he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold
he had acted imperfectly he knew very well that in his love for lucie
his renunciation of his social place though by no means new to his own
mind had been hurried and incomplete he knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it and that he had meant to
do it and that it had never been done
the happiness of his own chosen english home the necessity of being
always actively employed the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events of the week
following made all new again he knew very well that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded not without disquiet but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance that he had watched
the times for a time of action and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by and the nobility were trooping from
france by every highway and byway and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction and their very names were blotting out
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he had
relinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it won his own private place there and earned his own
bread monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions to spare the people to give them what little
there was to give such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof for his
own safety so that it could not but appear now
this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make
yes like the mariner in the old story the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it was drawing him
to itself and he must go everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on faster and faster more and more steadily to the terrible
attraction his latent uneasiness had been that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they was not there
trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity with this uneasiness half stifled and half reproaching
him he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong upon that comparison
injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur
which had stung him bitterly and those of stryver which above all were
coarse and galling for old reasons upon those had followed gabelles
letter the appeal of an innocent prisoner in danger of death to his
his resolution was made he must go to paris
yes the loadstone rock was drawing him and he must sail on until he
struck he knew of no rock he saw hardly any danger the intention
with which he had done what he had done even although he had left
it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert
it then that glorious vision of doing good which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
as he walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered that
neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone
lucie should be spared the pain of separation and her father always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old
should come to the knowledge of the step as a step taken and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt how much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind he did not
discuss with himself but that circumstance too had had its influence
he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to
return to tellsons and take leave of mr lorry as soon as he arrived
in paris he would present himself to this old friend but he must say
a carriage with post horses was ready at the bank door and jerry was
i have delivered that letter said charles darnay to mr lorry i
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer but
that i will and readily said mr lorry if it is not dangerous
not at all though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye
what is his name said mr lorry with his open pocket book in his
gabelle and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison
simply that he has received the letter and will come
he will start upon his journey to morrow night
he helped mr lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank into the
misty air of fleet street my love to lucie and to little lucie said
mr lorry at parting and take precious care of them till i come back
charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled as the carriage
that night it was the fourteenth of august he sat up late and wrote
two fervent letters one was to lucie explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to paris and showing her at length the reasons
that he had for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there the other was to the doctor confiding lucie and
their dear child to his care and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances to both he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety immediately after his arrival
it was a hard day that day of being among them with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind it was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious
but an affectionate glance at his wife so happy and busy made him
resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid and
the day passed quickly early in the evening he embraced her and her
scarcely less dear namesake pretending that he would return by and bye
an imaginary engagement took him out and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself now and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it he left his
two letters with a trusty porter to be delivered half an hour before
midnight and no sooner took horse for dover and began his journey
for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of the honour of
your noble name was the poor prisoners cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart as he left all that was dear on earth behind him and
book the third the track of a storm
the traveller fared slowly on his way who fared towards paris from
england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety two more than enough of bad roads bad equipages and bad
horses he would have encountered to delay him though the fallen and
unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory
but the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these every town gate and village taxing house had its band of
citizen patriots with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness who stopped all comers and goers cross questioned them
inspected their papers looked for their names in lists of their own
turned them back or sent them on or stopped them and laid them in
hold as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
republic one and indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or
a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished when charles
darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at paris whatever might befall now he must on to his journeys end
not a mean village closed upon him not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and england the universal
watchfulness so encompassed him that if he had been taken in a net
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage he could not have
this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in a day by
riding after him and taking him back riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation riding with him and keeping him in charge he had been
days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in
a little town on the high road still a long way from paris
nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelles letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far his difficulty at the
guard house in this small place had been such that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis and he was therefore as little surprised as
a man could be to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning in the middle of the night
awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on the bed
emigrant said the functionary i am going to send you on to paris
citizen i desire nothing more than to get to paris though i could
silence growled a red cap striking at the coverlet with the butt end
it is as the good patriot says observed the timid functionary you
are an aristocrat and must have an escort and must pay for it
choice listen to him cried the same scowling red cap as if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp iron
it is always as the good patriot says observed the functionary rise
darnay complied and was taken back to the guard house where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleeping by
a watch fire here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he
started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning
the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri coloured
cockades armed with national muskets and sabres who rode one on either
the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attached to
his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement
and out upon the mire deep roads in this state they traversed without
change except of horses and pace all the mire deep leagues that lay
they travelled in the night halting an hour or two after daybreak and
lying by until the twilight fell the escort were so wretchedly clothed
that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying
his musket very recklessly charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast for
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations
confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made
but when they came to the town of beauvais which they did at eventide
when the streets were filled with people he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming an ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting yard and many voices called
he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle and
emigrant my friends do you not see me here in france of my own
you are a cursed emigrant cried a farrier making at him in a
furious manner through the press hammer in hand and you are a cursed
the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the riders
bridle at which he was evidently making and soothingly said let him
be let him be he will be judged at paris
judged repeated the farrier swinging his hammer ay and condemned
as a traitor at this the crowd roared approval
checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to the
yard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on with
the line round his wrist darnay said as soon as he could make his
friends you deceive yourselves or you are deceived i am not a
he lies cried the smith he is a traitor since the decree his life
is forfeit to the people his cursed life is not his own
at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd which
another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates the farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned but no
what is this decree that the smith spoke of darnay asked the
postmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yard
truly a decree for selling the property of emigrants
everybody says it is but one of several and that there will be
others if there are not already banishing all emigrants and
condemning all to death who return that is what he meant when he said
what do i know said the postmaster shrugging his shoulders there
may be or there will be it is all the same what would you have
they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep after long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and
would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty or all drawn
up together singing a liberty song happily however there was sleep in
beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness jingling through the untimely cold and
wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their
way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads
daylight at last found them before the wall of paris the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it
where are the papers of this prisoner demanded a resolute looking man
in authority who was summoned out by the guard
naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him and which he had paid for
where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him
the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them casting his
eyes over gabelles letter the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise and looked at darnay with a close attention
he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went
into the guard room meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the
gate looking about him while in this state of suspense charles
darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots the latter far outnumbering the former and that while ingress
into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar
traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the homeliest
people was very difficult a numerous medley of men and women not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue
forth but the previous identification was so strict that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered
about the red cap and tri colour cockade were universal both among men
when he had sat in his saddle some half hour taking note of these
things darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority
who directed the guard to open the barrier then he delivered to the
escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him
to dismount he did so and the two patriots leading his tired horse
turned and rode away without entering the city
he accompanied his conductor into a guard room smelling of common wine
and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake
drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying about the
light in the guard house half derived from the waning oil lamps of
the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition some registers were lying open on a desk and an
officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these
citizen defarge said he to darnays conductor as he took a slip of
paper to write on is this the emigrant evremonde
without doubt you are consigned evremonde to the prison of la
just heaven exclaimed darnay under what law and for what offence
the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment
we have new laws evremonde and new offences since you were here he
said it with a hard smile and went on writing
i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily in response
to that written appeal of a fellow countryman which lies before you i
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay is not that
emigrants have no rights evremonde was the stolid reply the officer
wrote until he had finished read over to himself what he had written
sanded it and handed it to defarge with the words in secret
defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him the prisoner obeyed and a guard of two armed patriots attended
is it you said defarge in a low voice as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter of
doctor manette once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more
yes replied darnay looking at him with surprise
my name is defarge and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint
my wife came to your house to reclaim her father yes
the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge to say
with sudden impatience in the name of that sharp female newly born
and called la guillotine why did you come to france
you heard me say why a minute ago do you not believe it is the
a bad truth for you said defarge speaking with knitted brows and
indeed i am lost here all here is so unprecedented so changed so
sudden and unfair that i am absolutely lost will you render me a
none defarge spoke always looking straight before him
perhaps according to its nature you can say what it is
in this prison that i am going to so unjustly shall i have some free
i am not to be buried there prejudged and without any means of
you will see but what then other people have been similarly buried
defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in a steady
and set silence the deeper he sank into this silence the fainter hope
there was or so darnay thought of his softening in any slight degree
it is of the utmost importance to me you know citizen even better
than i of how much importance that i should be able to communicate to
mr lorry of tellsons bank an english gentleman who is now in paris
the simple fact without comment that i have been thrown into the
prison of la force will you cause that to be done for me
i will do defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you my duty is to
my country and the people i am the sworn servant of both against you
charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride
was touched besides as they walked on in silence he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets the very children scarcely noticed him a few passers turned
their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat
otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going to prison was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work in one narrow dark and dirty street through which they
passed an excited orator mounted on a stool was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people of the king and the royal
family the few words that he caught from this mans lips first made
it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris on the road except at
beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing the escort and the universal
that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left england he of course knew now that
perils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster and faster
yet he of course knew now he could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days and yet his misgivings were not so dark as imagined by
the light of this later time they would appear troubled as the future
was it was the unknown future and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope the horrible massacre days and nights long which within a few
rounds of the clock was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away the sharp female newly born and
called la guillotine was hardly known to him or to the generality
of people by name the frightful deeds that were to be soon done were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers how could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind
of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruel separation
from his wife and child he foreshadowed the likelihood or the
certainty but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly with this on
his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he
a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom defarge
what the devil how many more of them exclaimed the man with the
defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation and withdrew
what the devil i say again exclaimed the gaoler left with his wife
the gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the question merely
replied one must have patience my dear three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added for
the love of liberty which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that
in secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paper as
if i was not already full to bursting
he stuck the paper on a file in an ill humour and charles darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seat in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
come said the chief at length taking up his keys come with me
through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behind them
until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded with
prisoners of both sexes the women were seated at a long table reading
and writing knitting sewing and embroidering the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs or lingering up and down the
in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace the new comer recoiled from this company but the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride was their all at once rising to
receive him with every refinement of manner known to the time and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life
so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen that charles darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead ghosts all the ghost of beauty the ghost
of stateliness the ghost of elegance the ghost of pride the ghost of
frivolity the ghost of wit the ghost of youth the ghost of age all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there
it struck him motionless the gaoler standing at his side and the other
gaolers moving about who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there with the apparitions of the coquette the young beauty and the
mature woman delicately bred that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented was heightened to its
utmost surely ghosts all surely the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades
in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address coming forward i have the
honour of giving you welcome to la force and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us may it soon terminate
happily it would be an impertinence elsewhere but it is not so here
charles darnay roused himself and gave the required information in
but i hope said the gentleman following the chief gaoler with his
eyes who moved across the room that you are not in secret
i do not understand the meaning of the term but i have heard them say
ah what a pity we so much regret it but take courage several
members of our society have been in secret at first and it has lasted
but a short time then he added raising his voice i grieve to inform
there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voices among
which the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous gave
him good wishes and encouragement he turned at the grated door to
render the thanks of his heart it closed under the gaolers hand and
the wicket opened on a stone staircase leading upward when they had
ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them the gaoler opened a low black door and they passed into a
solitary cell it struck cold and damp but was not dark
such are not my orders you will be visited and can ask then at
present you may buy your food and nothing more
there were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress as
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the four
walls before going out a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated both in face and person as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water when the gaoler was
gone he thought in the same wandering way now am i left as if i were
dead stopping then to look down at the mattress he turned from it
with a sick feeling and thought and here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death
five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half five
paces by four and a half the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell
counting its measurement and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them he made shoes he made
shoes he made shoes the prisoner counted the measurement again and
paced faster to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition
the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed there was one among
them the appearance of a lady dressed in black who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair and she looked like     let us ride on again for gods sake
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake     he
made shoes he made shoes he made shoes     five paces by four and
a half with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind the prisoner walked faster and faster obstinately counting
and counting and the roar of the city changed to this extent that it
still rolled in like muffled drums but with the wail of voices that he
knew in the swell that rose above them
tellsons bank established in the saint germain quarter of paris was
in a wing of a large house approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate the house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles in his own cooks dress and got across the borders a
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
monseigneur gone and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and
indivisible of liberty equality fraternity or death monseigneurs
house had been first sequestrated and then confiscated for all
things moved so fast and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of september patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
monseigneurs house and had marked it with the tri colour and were
a place of business in london like tellsons place of business in paris
would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette
for what would staid british responsibility and respectability have
said to orange trees in boxes in a bank courtyard and even to a cupid
over the counter yet such things were tellsons had whitewashed the
cupid but he was still to be seen on the ceiling in the coolest
linen aiming as he very often does at money from morning to
night bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan in
lombard street london and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy and also of a looking glass let into the wall and
also of clerks not at all old who danced in public on the slightest
provocation yet a french tellsons could get on with these things
exceedingly well and as long as the times held together no man had
taken fright at them and drawn out his money
what money would be drawn out of tellsons henceforth and what would
lie there lost and forgotten what plate and jewels would tarnish in
tellsons hiding places while the depositors rusted in prisons
and when they should have violently perished how many accounts with
tellsons never to be balanced in this world must be carried over into
the next no man could have said that night any more than mr jarvis
lorry could though he thought heavily of these questions he sat by
a newly lighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw or any object in the
he occupied rooms in the bank in his fidelity to the house of which
he had grown to be a part like strong root ivy it chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that all such circumstances were indifferent to him so that he did
his duty on the opposite side of the courtyard under a colonnade
was extensive standing for carriages where indeed some carriages
of monseigneur yet stood against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux and in the light of these standing out in the
open air was a large grindstone a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy
or other workshop rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects mr lorry shivered and retired to his seat by the fire he had
opened not only the glass window but the lattice blind outside it and
he had closed both again and he shivered through his frame
from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came
the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring
in it weird and unearthly as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
thank god said mr lorry clasping his hands that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to night may he have mercy on all
soon afterwards the bell at the great gate sounded and he thought
they have come back and sat listening but there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard as he had expected and he heard the gate
the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the bank which a great change would naturally
awaken with such feelings roused it was well guarded and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it when his door suddenly
opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which he fell back in
lucie and her father lucie with her arms stretched out to him and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life
what is this cried mr lorry breathless and confused what is the
matter lucie manette what has happened what has brought you here
with the look fixed upon him in her paleness and wildness she panted
out in his arms imploringly o my dear friend my husband
has been here some days three or four i dont know how many i cant
collect my thoughts an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us he was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison
the old man uttered an irrepressible cry almost at the same moment the
bell of the great gate rang again and a loud noise of feet and voices
what is that noise said the doctor turning towards the window
dont look cried mr lorry dont look out manette for your life
the doctor turned with his hand upon the fastening of the window and
my dear friend i have a charmed life in this city i have been
a bastille prisoner there is no patriot in paris in paris in
france who knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille would
touch me except to overwhelm me with embraces or carry me in triumph
my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier and gained us news of charles there and brought us here i
knew it would be so i knew i could help charles out of all danger i
told lucie so what is that noise his hand was again upon the window
dont look cried mr lorry absolutely desperate no lucie my
dear nor you he got his arm round her and held her dont be so
terrified my love i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm
having happened to charles that i had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place what prison is he in
la force lucie my child if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life and you were always both you will compose yourself now to
do exactly as i bid you for more depends upon it than you can think or
i can say there is no help for you in any action on your part to night
you cannot possibly stir out i say this because what i must bid you
to do for charless sake is the hardest thing to do of all you must
instantly be obedient still and quiet you must let me put you in a
room at the back here you must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes and as there are life and death in the world you must not
i will be submissive to you i see in your face that you know i can do
nothing else than this i know you are true
the old man kissed her and hurried her into his room and turned the
key then came hurrying back to the doctor and opened the window and
partly opened the blind and put his hand upon the doctors arm and
looked out upon a throng of men and women not enough in number or near
enough to fill the courtyard not more than forty or fifty in all the
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose as in a convenient and retired spot
but such awful workers and such awful work
the grindstone had a double handle and turning at it madly were two
men whose faces as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise
false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty and all awry with
howling and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep as these ruffians turned and turned their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes now flung backward over their necks some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink and what with dropping
blood and what with dropping wine and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening stone were men stripped to the waist with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies men in all sorts of rags with the stain
upon those rags men devilishly set off with spoils of womens lace
and silk and ribbon with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through hatchets knives bayonets swords all brought to be
sharpened were all red with it some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them with strips of linen and fragments
of dress ligatures various in kind but all deep of the one colour and
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life to petrify with a well directed gun
all this was seen in a moment as the vision of a drowning man or of
any human creature at any very great pass could see a world if it
were there they drew back from the window and the doctor looked for
they are mr lorry whispered the words glancing fearfully round at
the locked room murdering the prisoners if you are sure of what you
say if you really have the power you think you have as i believe you
have make yourself known to these devils and get taken to la force it
may be too late i dont know but let it not be a minute later
doctor manette pressed his hand hastened bareheaded out of the room
and was in the courtyard when mr lorry regained the blind
his streaming white hair his remarkable face and the impetuous
confidence of his manner as he put the weapons aside like water
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone
for a few moments there was a pause and a hurry and a murmur and
the unintelligible sound of his voice and then mr lorry saw him
surrounded by all and in the midst of a line of twenty men long all
linked shoulder to shoulder and hand to shoulder hurried out with
cries of live the bastille prisoner help for the bastille prisoners
kindred in la force room for the bastille prisoner in front there save
the prisoner evremonde at la force and a thousand answering shouts
he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart closed the window
and the curtain hastened to lucie and told her that her father was
assisted by the people and gone in search of her husband he found
her child and miss pross with her but it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards when he sat
