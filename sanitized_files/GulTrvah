four times and i waited to hear some answers in a human voice but i
heard no other returns than in the same dialect only one or two a little
shriller than his i began to think that this house must belong to some
person of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremony
before i could gain admittance but that a man of quality should be
served all by horses was beyond my comprehension i feared my brain was
disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes i roused myself and looked
about me in the room where i was left alone this was furnished like the
first only after a more elegant manner i rubbed my eyes often but the
same objects still occurred i pinched my arms and sides to awake
myself hoping i might be in a dream i then absolutely concluded that
all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic
but i had no time to pursue these reflections for the gray horse came to
the door and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where i
saw a very comely mare together with a colt and foal sitting on their
haunches upon mats of straw not unartfully made and perfectly neat and
the mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat and coming up close
after having nicely observed my hands and face gave me a most
contemptuous look and turning to the horse i heard the word yahoo
often repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word i could not then
comprehend although it was the first i had learned to pronounce but i
was soon better informed to my everlasting mortification for the horse
beckoning to me with his head and repeating the hhuun hhuun as he
did upon the road which i understood was to attend him led me out into
a kind of court where was another building at some distance from the
house here we entered and i saw three of those detestable creatures
which i first met after my landing feeding upon roots and the flesh of
some animals which i afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs and
now and then a cow dead by accident or disease they were all tied by
the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam they held their food
between the claws of their fore feet and tore it with their teeth
the master horse ordered a sorrel nag one of his servants to untie the
largest of these animals and take him into the yard the beast and i
were brought close together and by our countenances diligently compared
both by master and servant who thereupon repeated several times the word
yahoo my horror and astonishment are not to be described when i
observed in this abominable animal a perfect human figure the face of
it indeed was flat and broad the nose depressed the lips large and the
mouth wide but these differences are common to all savage nations where
the lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives suffering
their infants to lie grovelling on the earth or by carrying them on
their backs nuzzling with their face against the mothers shoulders
the fore feet of the yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else but
the length of the nails the coarseness and brownness of the palms and
the hairiness on the backs there was the same resemblance between our
feet with the same differences which i knew very well though the
horses did not because of my shoes and stockings the same in every part
of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour which i have already
the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses was to see
the rest of my body so very different from that of a yahoo for which i
was obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception the sorrel
nag offered me a root which he held after their manner as we shall
describe in its proper place between his hoof and pastern i took it in
my hand and having smelt it returned it to him again as civilly as i
could he brought out of the yahoos kennel a piece of asss flesh
but it smelt so offensively that i turned from it with loathing he then
threw it to the yahoo by whom it was greedily devoured he afterwards
showed me a wisp of hay and a fetlock full of oats but i shook my head
to signify that neither of these were food for me and indeed i now
apprehended that i must absolutely starve if i did not get to some of my
own species for as to those filthy yahoos although there were few
greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself yet i confess i never
saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts and the more i
came near them the more hateful they grew while i stayed in that
country this the master horse observed by my behaviour and therefore
sent the yahoo back to his kennel he then put his fore hoof to his
mouth at which i was much surprised although he did it with ease and
with a motion that appeared perfectly natural and made other signs to
know what i would eat but i could not return him such an answer as he
was able to apprehend and if he had understood me i did not see how it
was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment while
we were thus engaged i observed a cow passing by whereupon i pointed to
her and expressed a desire to go and milk her this had its effect for
he led me back into the house and ordered a mare servant to open a room
where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels after a
very orderly and cleanly manner she gave me a large bowlful of which i
drank very heartily and found myself well refreshed
about noon i saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a
sledge by four yahoos there was in it an old steed who seemed to be
of quality he alighted with his hind feet forward having by accident
got a hurt in his left fore foot he came to dine with our horse who
received him with great civility they dined in the best room and had
oats boiled in milk for the second course which the old horse ate warm
but the rest cold their mangers were placed circular in the middle of
the room and divided into several partitions round which they sat on
their haunches upon bosses of straw in the middle was a large rack
with angles answering to every partition of the manger so that each
horse and mare ate their own hay and their own mash of oats and milk
with much decency and regularity the behaviour of the young colt and
foal appeared very modest and that of the master and mistress extremely
cheerful and complaisant to their guest the gray ordered me to stand by
him and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me
as i found by the strangers often looking on me and the frequent
i happened to wear my gloves which the master gray observing seemed
perplexed discovering signs of wonder what i had done to my fore feet
he put his hoof three or four times to them as if he would signify that
i should reduce them to their former shape which i presently did
pulling off both my gloves and putting them into my pocket this
occasioned farther talk and i saw the company was pleased with my
behaviour whereof i soon found the good effects i was ordered to speak
the few words i understood and while they were at dinner the master
taught me the names for oats milk fire water and some others which i
could readily pronounce after him having from my youth a great facility
when dinner was done the master horse took me aside and by signs and
words made me understand the concern he was in that i had nothing to eat
oats in their tongue are called hlunnh this word i pronounced two or
three times for although i had refused them at first yet upon second
thoughts i considered that i could contrive to make of them a kind of
bread which might be sufficient with milk to keep me alive till i
could make my escape to some other country and to creatures of my own
species the horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his
family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray
these i heated before the fire as well as i could and rubbed them till
the husks came off which i made a shift to winnow from the grain i
ground and beat them between two stones then took water and made them
into a paste or cake which i toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk
it was at first a very insipid diet though common enough in many parts
of europe but grew tolerable by time and having been often reduced to
hard fare in my life this was not the first experiment i had made how
easily nature is satisfied and i cannot but observe that i never had
one hours sickness while i stayed in this island it is true i
sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by springs made of
yahoos hairs and i often gathered wholesome herbs which i boiled
and ate as salads with my bread and now and then for a rarity i made a
little butter and drank the whey i was at first at a great loss for
salt but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it and i am confident
that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury and was
first introduced only as a provocative to drink except where it is
necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages or in places remote from
great markets for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man and as
to myself when i left this country it was a great while before i could
endure the taste of it in anything that i ate
this is enough to say upon the subject of my diet wherewith other
travellers fill their books as if the readers were personally concerned
whether we fare well or ill however it was necessary to mention this
matter lest the world should think it impossible that i could find
sustenance for three years in such a country and among such inhabitants
when it grew towards evening the master horse ordered a place for me to
lodge in it was but six yards from the house and separated from the
stable of the yahoos here i got some straw and covering myself with
my own clothes slept very sound but i was in a short time better
accommodated as the reader shall know hereafter when i come to treat
the author studies to learn the language the houyhnhnm his master
assists in teaching him the language described several houyhnhnms of
quality come out of curiosity to see the author he gives his master a
my principal endeavour was to learn the language which my master for so
i shall henceforth call him and his children and every servant of his
house were desirous to teach me for they looked upon it as a prodigy
that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature i
pointed to every thing and inquired the name of it which i wrote down
in my journal book when i was alone and corrected my bad accent by
desiring those of the family to pronounce it often in this employment
a sorrel nag one of the under servants was very ready to assist me
in speaking they pronounced through the nose and throat and their
language approaches nearest to the high dutch or german of any i know
in europe but is much more graceful and significant the emperor
charles v made almost the same observation when he said that if he
were to speak to his horse it should be in high dutch
the curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spent
many hours of his leisure to instruct me he was convinced as he
afterwards told me that i must be a yahoo but my teachableness
civility and cleanliness astonished him which were qualities
altogether opposite to those animals he was most perplexed about my
clothes reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were a part of my
body for i never pulled them off till the family were asleep and got
them on before they waked in the morning my master was eager to learn
whence i came how i acquired those appearances of reason which i
discovered in all my actions and to know my story from my own mouth
which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency i made in
learning and pronouncing their words and sentences to help my memory
i formed all i learned into the english alphabet and writ the words
down with the translations this last after some time i ventured to
do in my masters presence it cost me much trouble to explain to him
what i was doing for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or
in about ten weeks time i was able to understand most of his questions
and in three months could give him some tolerable answers he was
extremely curious to know from what part of the country i came and how
i was taught to imitate a rational creature because the yahoos whom
he saw i exactly resembled in my head hands and face that were only
visible with some appearance of cunning and the strongest disposition
to mischief were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes i
answered that i came over the sea from a far place with many others
of my own kind in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees
that my companions forced me to land on this coast and then left me to
shift for myself it was with some difficulty and by the help of many
signs that i brought him to understand me he replied that i must
needs be mistaken or that i said the thing which was not for they have
no word in their language to express lying or falsehood he knew it was
impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea or that a parcel
of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water he
was sure no houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel nor would trust
the word houyhnhnm in their tongue signifies a horse and in its
etymology the perfection of nature i told my master that i was at
a loss for expression but would improve as fast as i could and hoped
in a short time i should be able to tell him wonders he was pleased
to direct his own mare his colt and foal and the servants of the
family to take all opportunities of instructing me and every day for
two or three hours he was at the same pains himself several horses and
mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house upon the
report spread of a wonderful yahoo that could speak like a
houyhnhnm and seemed in his words and actions to discover some
glimmerings of reason these delighted to converse with me they put
many questions and received such answers as i was able to return by
all these advantages i made so great a progress that in five months
from my arrival i understood whatever was spoken and could express
the houyhnhnms who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me could hardly believe me to be a right yahoo
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind they
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin except on
my head face and hands but i discovered that secret to my master upon
an accident which happened about a fortnight before
i have already told the reader that every night when the family were
gone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my clothes
it happened one morning early that my master sent for me by the sorrel
nag who was his valet when he came i was fast asleep my clothes
fallen off on one side and my shirt above my waist i awaked at the
noise he made and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder
after which he went to my master and in a great fright gave him a very
confused account of what he had seen this i presently discovered for
going as soon as i was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour he
asked me the meaning of what his servant had reported that i was not
the same thing when i slept as i appeared to be at other times that his
vale assured him some part of me was white some yellow at least not so
i had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress in order to distinguish
myself as much as possible from that cursed race of yahoos but now i
found it in vain to do so any longer besides i considered that my
clothes and shoes would soon wear out which already were in a declining
condition and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of
yahoos or other brutes whereby the whole secret would be known i
therefore told my master that in the country whence i came those of my
kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals
prepared by art as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air
both hot and cold of which as to my own person i would give him
immediate conviction if he pleased to command me only desiring his
excuse if i did not expose those parts that nature taught us to
conceal he said my discourse was all very strange but especially
the last part for he could not understand why nature should teach us to
conceal what nature had given that neither himself nor family were
ashamed of any parts of their bodies but however i might do as i
pleased whereupon i first unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off i
did the same with my waistcoat i drew off my shoes stockings and
breeches i let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottom
fastening it like a girdle about my middle to hide my nakedness
my master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity
and admiration he took up all my clothes in his pastern one piece
after another and examined them diligently he then stroked my body very
gently and looked round me several times after which he said it was
plain i must be a perfect yahoo but that i differed very much from the
rest of my species in the softness whiteness and smoothness of my skin
my want of hair in several parts of my body the shape and shortness of
my claws behind and before and my affectation of walking continually on
my two hinder feet he desired to see no more and gave me leave to put
on my clothes again for i was shuddering with cold
i expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of
yahoo an odious animal for which i had so utter a hatred and
contempt i begged he would forbear applying that word to me and make
the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to
see me i requested likewise that the secret of my having a false
covering to my body might be known to none but himself at least as long
as my present clothing should last for as to what the sorrel nag his
valet had observed his honour might command him to conceal it
all this my master very graciously consented to and thus the secret was
kept till my clothes began to wear out which i was forced to supply by
several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned in the meantime
he desired i would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their
language because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and
reason than at the figure of my body whether it were covered or not
adding that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which i
thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me he
brought me into all company and made them treat me with civility
because as he told them privately this would put me into good
every day when i waited on him beside the trouble he was at in
teaching he would ask me several questions concerning myself which i
answered as well as i could and by these means he had already received
some general ideas though very imperfect it would be tedious to relate
the several steps by which i advanced to a more regular conversation but
the first account i gave of myself in any order and length was to this
that i came from a very far country as i already had attempted to tell
him with about fifty more of my own species that we travelled upon the
seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than his honours
house i described the ship to him in the best terms i could and
explained by the help of my handkerchief displayed how it was driven
forward by the wind that upon a quarrel among us i was set on shore on
this coast where i walked forward without knowing whither till he
delivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos he asked
me who made the ship and how it was possible that the houyhnhnms of
my country would leave it to the management of brutes my answer was
that i durst proceed no further in my relation unless he would give me
his word and honour that he would not be offended and then i would tell
him the wonders i had so often promised he agreed and i went on by
assuring him that the ship was made by creatures like myself who in
all the countries i had travelled as well as in my own were the only
governing rational animals and that upon my arrival hither i was as
much astonished to see the houyhnhnms act like rational beings as he
or his friends could be in finding some marks of reason in a creature
he was pleased to call a yahoo to which i owned my resemblance in
every part but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature
i said farther that if good fortune ever restored me to my native
country to relate my travels hither as i resolved to do everybody
would believe that i said the thing that was not that i invented the
story out of my own head and with all possible respect to himself his
family and friends and under his promise of not being offended our
countrymen would hardly think it probable that a houyhnhnm should be
the presiding creature of a nation and a yahoo the brute
the houyhnhnms notion of truth and falsehood the authors discourse
disapproved by his master the author gives a more particular account of
my master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his
countenance because doubting or not believing are so little known in
this country that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves
under such circumstances and i remember in frequent discourses with my
master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world
having occasion to talk of lying and false representation it was with
much difficulty that he comprehended what i meant although he had
otherwise a most acute judgment for he argued thus that the use of
speech was to make us understand one another and to receive information
of facts now if any one said the thing which was not these ends were
defeated because i cannot properly be said to understand him and i am
so far from receiving information that he leaves me worse than in
ignorance for i am led to believe a thing black when it is white and
short when it is long and these were all the notions he had
concerning that faculty of lying so perfectly well understood and so
to return from this digression when i asserted that the yahoos were
the only governing animals in my country which my master said was
altogether past his conception he desired to know whether we had
houyhnhnms among us and what was their employment i told him we
had great numbers that in summer they grazed in the fields and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats where yahoo servants were
employed to rub their skins smooth comb their manes pick their feet
serve them with food and make their beds i understand you well
said my master it is now very plain from all you have spoken that
whatever share of reason the yahoos pretend to the houyhnhnms are
your masters i heartily wish our yahoos would be so tractable i
begged his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further
because i was very certain that the account he expected from me would be
highly displeasing but he insisted in commanding me to let him know
the best and the worst i told him he should be obeyed i owned that
the houyhnhnms among us whom we called horses were the most generous
and comely animals we had that they excelled in strength and swiftness
and when they belonged to persons of quality were employed in
travelling racing or drawing chariots they were treated with much
kindness and care till they fell into diseases or became foundered in
the feet but then they were sold and used to all kind of drudgery till
they died after which their skins were stripped and sold for what they
were worth and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of
prey but the common race of horses had not so good fortune being kept
by farmers and carriers and other mean people who put them to greater
labour and fed them worse i described as well as i could our way of
riding the shape and use of a bridle a saddle a spur and a whip of
harness and wheels i added that we fastened plates of a certain hard
substance called iron at the bottom of their feet to preserve their
hoofs from being broken by the stony ways on which we often travelled
my master after some expressions of great indignation wondered how we
dared to venture upon a houyhnhnms back for he was sure that the
weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest
yahoo or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze the brute to
death i answered that our horses were trained up from three or four
years old to the several uses we intended them for that if any of them
proved intolerably vicious they were employed for carriages that they
were severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous tricks
that the males designed for the common use of riding or draught were
generally castrated about two years after their birth to take down their
spirits and make them more tame and gentle that they were indeed
sensible of rewards and punishments but his honour would please to
consider that they had not the least tincture of reason any more than
it put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master a right
idea of what i spoke for their language does not abound in variety of
words because their wants and passions are fewer than among us but it
is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of
the houyhnhnm race particularly after i had explained the manner and
use of castrating horses among us to hinder them from propagating their
kind and to render them more servile he said if it were possible
there could be any country where yahoos alone were endued with reason
they certainly must be the governing animal because reason in time will
always prevail against brutal strength but considering the frame of
our bodies and especially of mine he thought no creature of equal bulk
was so ill contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of
life whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom i lived
resembled me or the yahoos of his country i assured him that i
was as well shaped as most of my age but the younger and the females
were much more soft and tender and the skins of the latter generally as
white as milk he said i differed indeed from other yahoos being
much more cleanly and not altogether so deformed but in point of real
advantage he thought i differed for the worse that my nails were of no
use either to my fore or hinder feet as to my fore feet he could not
properly call them by that name for he never observed me to walk upon
them that they were too soft to bear the ground that i generally went
with them uncovered neither was the covering i sometimes wore on them of
the same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that i could not
walk with any security for if either of my hinder feet slipped i must
inevitably fail he then began to find fault with other parts of my
body the flatness of my face the prominence of my nose mine eyes
placed directly in front so that i could not look on either side without
turning my head that i was not able to feed myself without lifting one
of my fore feet to my mouth and therefore nature had placed those joints
to answer that necessity he knew not what could be the use of those
several clefts and divisions in my feet behind that these were too soft
to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering made
from the skin of some other brute that my whole body wanted a fence
against heat and cold which i was forced to put on and off every day
with tediousness and trouble and lastly that he observed every animal
in this country naturally to abhor the yahoos whom the weaker avoided
and the stronger drove from them so that supposing us to have the gift
of reason he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural
antipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequently
how we could tame and render them serviceable however he would as he
said debate the matter no farther because he was more desirous to know
my own story the country where i was born and the several actions and
events of my life before i came hither
i assured him how extremely desirous i was that he should be satisfied
on every point but i doubted much whether it would be possible for me
to explain myself on several subjects whereof his honour could have no
conception because i saw nothing in his country to which i could
resemble them that however i would do my best and strive to express
myself by similitudes humbly desiring his assistance when i wanted
proper words which he was pleased to promise me
i said my birth was of honest parents in an island called england
which was remote from his country as many days journey as the strongest
of his honours servants could travel in the annual course of the sun
that i was bred a surgeon whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in
the body gotten by accident or violence that my country was governed by
a female man whom we called queen that i left it to get riches whereby
i might maintain myself and family when i should return that in my
last voyage i was commander of the ship and had about fifty yahoos
under me many of which died at sea and i was forced to supply them by
others picked out from several nations that our ship was twice in danger
of being sunk the first time by a great storm and the second by
striking against a rock here my master interposed by asking me how
i could persuade strangers out of different countries to venture with
me after the losses i had sustained and the hazards i had run i
said they were fellows of desperate fortunes forced to fly from the
places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes some
were undone by lawsuits others spent all they had in drinking whoring
and gaming others fled for treason many for murder theft poisoning
robbery perjury forgery coining false money for committing rapes or
sodomy for flying from their colours or deserting to the enemy and
most of them had broken prison none of these durst return to their
native countries for fear of being hanged or of starving in a jail and
therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other
during this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me several
times i had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the
nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced
to fly their country this labour took up several days conversation
before he was able to comprehend me he was wholly at a loss to know
what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices to clear
up which i endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and
riches of the terrible effects of lust intemperance malice and envy
all this i was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making
suppositions after which like one whose imagination was struck with
something never seen or heard of before he would lift up his eyes with
amazement and indignation power government war law punishment and
a thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could express
them which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any
conception of what i meant but being of an excellent understanding
much improved by contemplation and converse he at last arrived at a
competent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world is
capable to perform and desired i would give him some particular account
of that land which we call europe but especially of my own country
the author at his masters command informs him of the state of england
the causes of war among the princes of europe the author begins to
the reader may please to observe that the following extract of many
conversations i had with my master contains a summary of the most
material points which were discoursed at several times for above two
years his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction as i farther
improved in the houyhnhnm tongue i laid before him as well as i
could the whole state of europe i discoursed of trade and manufactures
of arts and sciences and the answers i gave to all the questions he
made as they arose upon several subjects were a fund of conversation
not to be exhausted but i shall here only set down the substance of
what passed between us concerning my own country reducing it in order as
well as i can without any regard to time or other circumstances while i
strictly adhere to truth my only concern is that i shall hardly be
able to do justice to my masters arguments and expressions which must
needs suffer by my want of capacity as well as by a translation into our
in obedience therefore to his honours commands i related to him the
revolution under the prince of orange the long war with france entered
into by the said prince and renewed by his successor the present queen
wherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged and which still
continued i computed at his request that about a million of yahoos
might have been killed in the whole progress of it and perhaps a hundred
or more cities taken and five times as many ships burnt or sunk
he asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one country
go to war with another i answered they were innumerable but i should
only mention a few of the chief sometimes the ambition of princes who
never think they have land or people enough to govern sometimes the
corruption of ministers who engage their master in a war in order to
stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil
administration difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives
for instance whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether the
juice of a certain berry be blood or wine whether whistling be a vice or
a virtue whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the fire
what is the best colour for a coat whether black white red or gray
and whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirty or clean
with many more neither are any wars so furious and bloody or of so
long a continuance as those occasioned by difference in opinion
sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them
shall dispossess a third of his dominions where neither of them pretend
to any right sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the
other should quarrel with him sometimes a war is entered upon because
the enemy is too strong and sometimes because he is too weak
sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have or have the
things which we want and we both fight till they take ours or give us
theirs it is a very justifiable cause of a war to invade a country
after the people have been wasted by famine destroyed by pestilence or
embroiled by factions among themselves it is justifiable to enter into
war against our nearest ally when one of his towns lies convenient for
us or a territory of land that would render our dominions round and
complete if a prince sends forces into a nation where the people are
poor and ignorant he may lawfully put half of them to death and make
slaves of the rest in order to civilize and reduce them from their
barbarous way of living it is a very kingly honourable and frequent
practice when one prince desires the assistance of another to secure
him against an invasion that the assistant when he has driven out the
invader should seize on the dominions himself and kill imprison or
banish the prince he came to relieve alliance by blood or marriage
is a frequent cause of war between princes and the nearer the kindred
is the greater their disposition to quarrel poor nations are hungry
and rich nations are proud and pride and hunger will ever be at
variance for these reasons the trade of a soldier is held the most
honourable of all others because a soldier is a yahoo hired to kill
in cold blood as many of his own species who have never offended him
there is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in europe not able to make
war by themselves who hire out their troops to richer nations for so
much a day to each man of which they keep three fourths to themselves
and it is the best part of their maintenance such are those in many
what you have told me said my master upon the subject of war does
indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to
however it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger and that
nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief for your
mouths lying flat with your faces you can hardly bite each other to any
purpose unless by consent then as to the claws upon your feet before
and behind they are so short and tender that one of our yahoos would
drive a dozen of yours before him and therefore in recounting the
numbers of those who have been killed in battle i cannot but think you
i could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at his
ignorance and being no stranger to the art of war i gave him a
description of cannons culverins muskets carabines pistols bullets
powder swords bayonets battles sieges retreats attacks undermines
countermines bombardments sea fights ships sunk with a thousand men
twenty thousand killed on each side dying groans limbs flying in the
air smoke noise confusion trampling to death under horses feet
flight pursuit victory fields strewed with carcases left for food to
dogs and wolves and birds of prey plundering stripping ravishing
burning and destroying and to set forth the valour of my own dear
countrymen i assured him that i had seen them blow up a hundred
enemies at once in a siege and as many in a ship and beheld the dead
bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds to the great diversion of the
i was going on to more particulars when my master commanded me silence
he said whoever understood the nature of yahoos might easily believe
it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action i had
named if their strength and cunning equalled their malice but as my
discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species so he found
it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger
before he thought his ears being used to such abominable words might
by degrees admit them with less detestation that although he hated the
yahoos of this country yet he no more blamed them for their odious
qualities than he did a gnnayh a bird of prey for its cruelty or a
sharp stone for cutting his hoof but when a creature pretending to
reason could be capable of such enormities he dreaded lest the
corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself he
seemed therefore confident that instead of reason we were only
possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices as the
reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen
he added that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both in
this and some former discourses there was another point which a little
perplexed him at present i had informed him that some of our crew left
their country on account of being ruined by law that i had already
explained the meaning of the word but he was at a loss how it should
come to pass that the law which was intended for every mans
preservation should be any mans ruin therefore he desired to be
further satisfied what i meant by law and the dispensers thereof
according to the present practice in my own country because he thought
nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal as we
pretended to be in showing us what he ought to do and what to avoid
i assured his honour that the law was a science in which i had not much
conversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon some
injustices that had been done me however i would give him all the
i said there was a society of men among us bred up from their youth in
the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose that white is
black and black is white according as they are paid to this society
all the rest of the people are slaves for example if my neighbour has
a mind to my cow he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow
from me i must then hire another to defend my right it being against
all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself
now in this case i who am the right owner lie under two great
disadvantages first my lawyer being practised almost from his cradle
in defending falsehood is quite out of his element when he would be an
advocate for justice which is an unnatural office he always attempts
with great awkwardness if not with ill will the second disadvantage
is that my lawyer must proceed with great caution or else he will be
reprimanded by the judges and abhorred by his brethren as one that
would lessen the practice of the law and therefore i have but two
methods to preserve my cow the first is to gain over my adversarys
lawyer with a double fee who will then betray his client by insinuating
that he hath justice on his side the second way is for my lawyer to
make my cause appear as unjust as he can by allowing the cow to belong
to my adversary and this if it be skilfully done will certainly
bespeak the favour of the bench now your honour is to know that these
judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property as
well as for the trial of criminals and picked out from the most
dexterous lawyers who are grown old or lazy and having been biassed all
their lives against truth and equity lie under such a fatal necessity of
favouring fraud perjury and oppression that i have known some of them
refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay rather than injure
the faculty by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office
it is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before
may legally be done again and therefore they take special care to record
all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general
reason of mankind these under the name of precedents they produce as
authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions and the judges never
in pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the
cause but are loud violent and tedious in dwelling upon all
circumstances which are not to the purpose for instance in the case
already mentioned they never desire to know what claim or title my
adversary has to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black her
horns long or short whether the field i graze her in be round or square
whether she was milked at home or abroad what diseases she is subject
to and the like after which they consult precedents adjourn the cause
from time to time and in ten twenty or thirty years come to an issue
it is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant and
jargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein all
their laws are written which they take special care to multiply whereby
they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood of
right and wrong so that it will take thirty years to decide whether the
field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to a
in the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the method
is much more short and commendable the judge first sends to sound the
disposition of those in power after which he can easily hang or save a
criminal strictly preserving all due forms of law
here my master interposing said it was a pity that creatures endowed
with such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers by the
description i gave of them must certainly be were not rather encouraged
to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge in answer to which
i assured his honour that in all points out of their own trade they
were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us the most
despicable in common conversation avowed enemies to all knowledge and
learning and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind
in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession
a continuation of the state of england under queen anne the character
of a first minister of state in european courts
my master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could
incite this race of lawyers to perplex disquiet and weary themselves
and engage in a confederacy of injustice merely for the sake of injuring
their fellow animals neither could he comprehend what i meant in saying
they did it for hire whereupon i was at much pains to describe to him
the use of money the materials it was made of and the value of the
metals that when a yahoo had got a great store of this precious
substance he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to the finest
clothing the noblest houses great tracts of land the most costly meats
and drinks and have his choice of the most beautiful females therefore
since money alone was able to perform all these feats our yahoos
thought they could never have enough of it to spend or to save as they
found themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or
avarice that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor mans labour
and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former that
the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably by labouring every
day for small wages to make a few live plentifully
i enlarged myself much on these and many other particulars to the same
purpose but his honour was still to seek for he went upon a
supposition that all animals had a title to their share in the
productions of the earth and especially those who presided over the
rest therefore he desired i would let him know what these costly
meats were and how any of us happened to want them whereupon i
enumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the various methods
of dressing them which could not be done without sending vessels by sea
to every part of the world as well for liquors to drink as for sauces
and innumerable other conveniences i assured him that this whole globe
of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better
female yahoos could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in he said
that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its
own inhabitants but what he chiefly wondered at was how such vast
tracts of ground as i described should be wholly without fresh water and
the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink i
replied that england the dear place of my nativity was computed to
produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are
able to consume as well as liquors extracted from grain or pressed out
of the fruit of certain trees which made excellent drink and the same
proportion in every other convenience of life but in order to feed the
luxury and intemperance of the males and the vanity of the females we
sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries
whence in return we brought the materials of diseases folly and vice
to spend among ourselves hence it follows of necessity that vast
numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging
star gazing poisoning whoring canting libelling freethinking and
the like occupations every one of which terms i was at much pains to
that wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the
want of water or other drinks but because it was a sort of liquid which
made us merry by putting us out of our senses diverted all melancholy
thoughts begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain raised our
hopes and banished our fears suspended every office of reason for a
time and deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into a
profound sleep although it must be confessed that we always awaked sick
and dispirited and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases
but beside all this the bulk of our people supported themselves by
furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to
each other for instance when i am at home and dressed as i ought to
be i carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen the
building and furniture of my house employ as many more and five times
i was going on to tell him of another sort of people who get their
livelihood by attending the sick having upon some occasions informed
his honour that many of my crew had died of diseases but here it was
with the utmost difficulty that i brought him to apprehend what i meant
he could easily conceive that a houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy a few
days before his death or by some accident might hurt a limb but that
nature who works all things to perfection should suffer any pains to
breed in our bodies he thought impossible and desired to know the
i told him we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each
other that we ate when we were not hungry and drank without the
provocation of thirst that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors
without eating a bit which disposed us to sloth inflamed our bodies
and precipitated or prevented digestion that prostitute female yahoos
acquired a certain malady which bred rottenness in the bones of those
who fell into their embraces that this and many other diseases were
propagated from father to son so that great numbers came into the world
with complicated maladies upon them that it would be endless to give him
a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies for they would not
be fewer than five or six hundred spread over every limb and joint in
short every part external and intestine having diseases appropriated
to itself to remedy which there was a sort of people bred up among us
in the profession or pretence of curing the sick and because i had
some skill in the faculty i would in gratitude to his honour let him
know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed
their fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion whence
they conclude that a great evacuation of the body is necessary either
through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth their next business
is from herbs minerals gums oils shells salts juices sea weed
excrements barks of trees serpents toads frogs spiders dead mens
flesh and bones birds beasts and fishes to form a composition for
smell and taste the most abominable nauseous and detestable they can
possibly contrive which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing
and this they call a vomit or else from the same store house with some
other poisonous additions they command us to take in at the orifice
above or below just as the physician then happens to be disposed a
medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels which relaxing
the belly drives down all before it and this they call a purge or a
clyster for nature as the physicians allege having intended the
superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and
liquids and the inferior posterior for ejection these artists
ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her
seat therefore to replace her in it the body must be treated in a
manner directly contrary by interchanging the use of each orifice
forcing solids and liquids in at the anus and making evacuations at the
but besides real diseases we are subject to many that are only
imaginary for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures these
have their several names and so have the drugs that are proper for them
and with these our female yahoos are always infested
one great excellency in this tribe is their skill at prognostics
wherein they seldom fail their predictions in real diseases when they
rise to any degree of malignity generally portending death which is
always in their power when recovery is not and therefore upon any
unexpected signs of amendment after they have pronounced their sentence
rather than be accused as false prophets they know how to approve their
sagacity to the world by a seasonable dose
they are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown
weary of their mates to eldest sons to great ministers of state and
i had formerly upon occasion discoursed with my master upon the nature
of government in general and particularly of our own excellent
constitution deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world but
having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state he commanded me
some time after to inform him what species of yahoo i particularly
i told him that a first or chief minister of state who was the person
i intended to describe was the creature wholly exempt from joy and
grief love and hatred pity and anger at least makes use of no other
passions but a violent desire of wealth power and titles that he
applies his words to all uses except to the indication of his mind that
he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a
lie nor a lie but with a design that you should take it for a truth
that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of
preferment and whenever he begins to praise you to others or to
yourself you are from that day forlorn the worst mark you can receive
is a promise especially when it is confirmed with an oath after which
every wise man retires and gives over all hopes
there are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief minister
the first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of a wife a
daughter or a sister the second by betraying or undermining his
predecessor and the third is by a furious zeal in public assemblies
against the corruptions of the court but a wise prince would rather
choose to employ those who practise the last of these methods because
such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will
and passions of their master that these ministers having all
employments at their disposal preserve themselves in power by bribing
the majority of a senate or great council and at last by an expedient
called an act of indemnity whereof i described the nature to him
they secure themselves from after reckonings and retire from the public
the palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his
own trade the pages lackeys and porters by imitating their master
become ministers of state in their several districts and learn to excel
in the three principal ingredients of insolence lying and bribery
accordingly they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the
best rank and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence arrive
through several gradations to be successors to their lord
he is usually governed by a decayed wench or favourite footman who are
the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed and may properly be
called in the last resort the governors of the kingdom
one day in discourse my master having heard me mention the nobility of
my country was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretend
to deserve that he was sure i must have been born of some noble family
because i far exceeded in shape colour and cleanliness all the
yahoos of his nation although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty of
speech but likewise with some rudiments of reason to a degree that
with all his acquaintance i passed for a prodigy
he made me observe that among the houyhnhnms the white the sorrel
and the iron gray were not so exactly shaped as the bay the
dapple gray and the black nor born with equal talents of mind or a
capacity to improve them and therefore continued always in the condition
of servants without ever aspiring to match out of their own race which
in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural
i made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he
was pleased to conceive of me but assured him at the same time that my
birth was of the lower sort having been born of plain honest parents
who were just able to give me a tolerable education that nobility among
us was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it that our
young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury
that as soon as years will permit they consume their vigour and
contract odious diseases among lewd females and when their fortunes are
almost ruined they marry some woman of mean birth disagreeable person
and unsound constitution merely for the sake of money whom they hate
and despise that the productions of such marriages are generally
scrofulous rickety or deformed children by which means the family
seldom continues above three generations unless the wife takes care to
provide a healthy father among her neighbours or domestics in order to
improve and continue the breed that a weak diseased body a meagre
countenance and sallow complexion are the true marks of noble blood
and a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality
that the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a
coachman the imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his
body being a composition of spleen dullness ignorance caprice
without the consent of this illustrious body no law can be enacted
repealed or altered and these nobles have likewise the decision of all
the authors great love of his native country his masters observations
upon the constitution and administration of england as described by the
author with parallel cases and comparisons his masters observations
the reader may be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself to
give so free a representation of my own species among a race of mortals
who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind from
that entire congruity between me and their yahoos but i must freely
confess that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds placed in
opposite view to human corruptions had so far opened my eyes and
enlarged my understanding that i began to view the actions and passions
of man in a very different light and to think the honour of my own kind
not worth managing which besides it was impossible for me to do
before a person of so acute a judgment as my master who daily convinced
me of a thousand faults in myself whereof i had not the least perception
before and which with us would never be numbered even among human
infirmities i had likewise learned from his example an utter
detestation of all falsehood or disguise and truth appeared so amiable
to me that i determined upon sacrificing every thing to it
let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet
a much stronger motive for the freedom i took in my representation of
things i had not yet been a year in this country before i contracted
such a love and veneration for the inhabitants that i entered on a firm
resolution never to return to humankind but to pass the rest of my life
among these admirable houyhnhnms in the contemplation and practice of
every virtue where i could have no example or incitement to vice but
it was decreed by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great a felicity
should not fall to my share however it is now some comfort to reflect
that in what i said of my countrymen i extenuated their faults as much
as i durst before so strict an examiner and upon every article gave as
favourable a turn as the matter would bear for indeed who is there
alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of
