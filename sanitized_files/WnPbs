anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would have
said that if only the french made one more slight effort it would
disappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would have
said that the russians need only make one more slight effort and the
french would be destroyed but neither the french nor the russians made
that effort and the flame of battle burned slowly out
the russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
the french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way
to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
beginning but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the french
from their positions they could not have made this last effort for all
the russian troops had been broken up there was no part of the russian
army that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding their
positions they had lost one half of their army
the french with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen
years with the assurance of napoleons invincibility with the
consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intact
twenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort the french
who had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position
ought to have made that effort for as long as the russians continued to
block the road to moscow as before the aim of the french had not been
attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain but the french
did not make that effort some historians say that napoleon need only
have used his old guards who were intact and the battle would have
been won to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent his
guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring it
could not be napoleon did not give his guards not because he did not
want to but because it could not be done all the generals officers
and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done because the
flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it
it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of
the mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals and
soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not
after all their experience of previous battles when after one tenth of
such efforts the enemy had fled experienced a similar feeling of terror
before an enemy who after losing half his men stood as threateningly
at the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force of the
attacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which is
defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks called
standards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were
standing but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral
superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the
russians at borodino the french invaders like an infuriated animal
that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they were
perishing but could not stop any more than the russian army weaker by
one half could help swerving by impetus gained the french army was
still able to roll forward to moscow but there without further effort
on the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding from the mortal
wound it had received at borodino the direct consequence of the battle
of borodino was napoleons senseless flight from moscow his retreat
along the old smolensk road the destruction of the invading army of
five hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic france on
which at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind
laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he
examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same
time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary
division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is a
well known so called sophism of the ancients consisting in this that
achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite
of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by the
time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the
tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of
him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered
another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the
ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never
overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily
divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles
by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a
solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted
the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical
progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of
this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem
a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
problems of motion which used to appear insoluble
this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing
with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small
and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity
and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot
avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of
in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens
the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all
those human wills mans mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected
series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though
there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always
the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king or
a commander as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas
the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a
historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually
takes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small the
units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others
or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will of
many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is
it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or
smaller unit as the subject of observation as criticism has every right
to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the
differential of history that is the individual tendencies of men and
attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum of
these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history
the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an
extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary
pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and
slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some
years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive
movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of
this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man
the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and
doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris calling
these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailed
biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him
tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that
is why this movement took place and those are its laws
but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation but
plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in
it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum of
human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum of
those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them
but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors
every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time
conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the
conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a
war in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my
watch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring
church but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock
reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is
caused by the position of the hands of the watch
whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see
the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude
that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the
the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks
are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is
budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the
unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force
of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a
coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the
hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the
oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the engine
moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change my
point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bells
and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this
to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and
study the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in
this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is
evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much
mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and
ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning
the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russian
army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached and again
from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow its
goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the
velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind
it were seven hundred miles of hunger stricken hostile country ahead
were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in
napoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum
the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
of the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and
consolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army was
broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after the
collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another
having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of
invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some
distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force
the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the french
reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after that
there was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleeding
mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow
for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they
made a dash for the kaluga road and after a victory for at malo
yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs without
undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back
to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna and
on the evening of the twenty sixth of august kutuzov and the whole
russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory
kutuzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for a
fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone
but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken
but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of
unheard of losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battle
it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected
the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the
slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been
killed and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the
very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself
upon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
from its aim kutuzovs wish was to attack next day and the whole army
desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not
sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that
possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a days
march and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another
and a third days march and at last on the first of september when the
army drew near moscow despite the strength of the feeling that had
arisen in all ranks the force of circumstances compelled it to retire
beyond moscow and the troops retired one more last days march and
for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
made by generals as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may
imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the
questions present themselves why did kutuzov during the retreat not do
this or that why did he not take up a position before reaching fili
why did he not retire at once by the kaluga road abandoning moscow and
so on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know
the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
commander in chief the activity of a commander in chief does not at all
resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our
studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of
troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our
plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with
the beginning of any event the position from which we always
contemplate it the commander in chief is always in the midst of a
series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the
whole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event
is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous
uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst
of a most complex play of intrigues worries contingencies
authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is
continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him
learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should
have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili and
that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander
in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not
one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based
a commander in chiefs business it would seem is simply to choose one
of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not
wait for instance on the twenty eighth it is suggested to him to cross
to the kaluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up from
miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire an
order must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat
carries us past the turn to the kaluga road and after the adjutant
comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken
and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a
courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does
not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in
chiefs rival the man who is undermining him and there are always not
merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically
opposed to that of turning to the kaluga road and the commander in
chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a
respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of
rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to
be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and
gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously
sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on
reconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys army
differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefs actions describe to us
for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the
commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide
whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army
less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had
that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably
of all on the twenty fourth of august at shevardino and on the twenty
sixth at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from
when ermolov having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position told
the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow
and that they must retreat kutuzov looked at him in silence
give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel the
pulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you are
kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow
on the poklonny hill four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow
kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside
a great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchin who
had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated
into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages
of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the
situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had
not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called they
all felt that this was really a council of war the conversations all
dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news
it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
matters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among all
these men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among
themselves tried to keep near the commander in chief whose bench
formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might
overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said
and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself
take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing
what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned
away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of
anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been
chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
capacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had
been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was
described by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform
this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian
army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the
possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchin
was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city
train bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could not
help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening and
that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth
group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions
discussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group
was talking absolute nonsense kutuzovs expression grew more and more
preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that
to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
those words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless
commander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but the
battle would still not take place it would not take place because the
commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but
in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
inevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a
field of battle they considered impossible to hold the lower grade
officers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered the
position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced
as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being
defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer
important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue
bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian
patriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing by
insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight
to kutuzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutuzov who had
brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle if
it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were not
given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this
intrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one terrible question
absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the
question for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reach
moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been
yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat or was it the evening
before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was it
earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow
must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be
given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
resigning the command of the army and not only did he love power to
which he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorovski
under whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convinced
that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the
emperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen
commander in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain
command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all
the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear
and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but
something had to be decided and these conversations around him which
were assuming too free a character must be stopped
he called the most important generals to him
my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising
from the bench and he rode to fili where his carriages were waiting
the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
better and roomier part of andrew savostyanovs hut the men women and
children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across
the passage only malasha andrews six year old granddaughter whom his
serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar
while drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the
larger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
faces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after another
came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under
the icons granddad himself as malasha in her own mind called
kutuzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep
in a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
the collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to
pinch his neck those who entered went up one by one to the field
marshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others his adjutant
kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
kutuzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understood
that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen
round the peasants deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and
papers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another
bench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and toll who had
just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place immediately
under the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging into
his bald crown he had a st georges cross round his neck and looked
pale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was now shivering
and in pain beside him sat uvarov who with rapid gesticulations was
giving him some information speaking in low tones as they all did
chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised
and arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count ostermann
tolstoy seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts his broad head with its
bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand raevski
twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit
glanced now at kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatience
konovnitsyns firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tender
sly smile his glance met malashas and the expression of his eyes
they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting
the position was finishing his savory dinner they waited for him from
four till six oclock and did not begin their deliberations all that
time but talked in low tones of other matters
only when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutuzov leave his corner and
draw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had been
bennigsen opened the council with the question are we to abandon
russias ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we to
defend it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frown
on every face and only kutuzovs angry grunts and occasional cough broke
the silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha too looked at
granddad she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered he
seemed about to cry but this did not last long
russias ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating
bennigsens words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the
false note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that that
question has no meaning for a russian he lurched his heavy body
forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question
i have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one the
question is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscow
without a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
as moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and he
the discussion began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost
admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili
was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the love of
moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank
during the night and attack the french right flank the following day
opinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against that
project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whether
feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
or guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not
to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of
events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other
generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of
moscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat
malasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her
understood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her that
it was only a personal struggle between granddad and long coat as
she termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to
one another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of
the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle
glance and then to her joys she saw that granddad said something to
long coat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced
angrily up and down the room what so affected him was kutuzovs calm
and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of bennigsens
proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
gentlemen said kutuzov i cannot approve of the counts plan moving
troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military
history supports that view for instance kutuzov seemed to reflect
searching for an example then with a clear naive look at bennigsen he
added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count
well remembers and which was not fully successful only because our
there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all
the discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all
felt that there was no more to be said
during one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
well gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken
crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen
i have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he
paused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country
after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral
some of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different from
the way they had spoken during the council communicated something to
malasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully
backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its
projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted
when he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with his
elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question
when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was
that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it
i did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the
latter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not think
you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider
but no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed
kutuzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist they
at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating
without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow
rostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
event acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov
after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was
as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting
every russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the
feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers
the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns
and villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk without the
participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the people
awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tear
anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to
find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the
enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property
while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left
the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and
is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of this
and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in russian
moscow society in 1812 those who had quitted moscow already in july and
at the beginning of august showed that they expected this those who
went away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half
their belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expresses
itself not by phrases or by giving ones children to save the fatherland
and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically
and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results
it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running
away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin
impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed
to be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing it
had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that
rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had
committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the
rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had
remained intact and that during napoleons occupation the inhabitants
had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen
whom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked so
they went away because for russians there could be no question as to
whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it was
out of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thing
that could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino and
still more rapidly after it despite rostopchins calls to defend moscow
or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder working icon of
the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that were
to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote in
his broadsheets they knew that it was for the army to fight and that
if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house
serfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and that
they must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property to
destruction they went away without thinking of the tremendous
significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
destruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on his
own account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that
the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
greatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of being
stopped by count rostopchins orders had already in june moved with her
negroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate with a
vague consciousness that she was not bonapartes servant was really
simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but
count rostopchin who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the
government offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to the
drunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and now
forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints now
seized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and thirty six
of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich now
hinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to his
own house now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding
them for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory of having
hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed now
ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and now
reproached them for doing so now expelled all the french residents from
moscow and now allowed madame aubert chalme the center of the whole
french colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable old
postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular
offense now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french
and now to get rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed and
himself drove away by a back gate now declared that he would not
survive the fall of moscow and now wrote french verses in albums
concerning his share in the affair this man did not understand the
meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself
that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feat
and like a child he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable event
the abandonment and burning of moscow and tried with his puny hand now
to speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him along
helene having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg found
in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formed
an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg
both the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their
rights helene was faced by a new problem how to preserve her intimacy
what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did
not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova who evidently
deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she attempted
concealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by
cunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself
guilty but helene like a really great man who can do whatever he
pleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as she
sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blame
the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her she
lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly thats
just like a man selfish and cruel i expected nothing else a woman
sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward what
right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and
friendships he is a man who has been more than a father to me the
prince was about to say something but helene interrupted him
well yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for me
than those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
on him i am not a man that i should repay kindness with ingratitude
know monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings i
render account only to god and to my conscience she concluded laying
her hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up to
marry me and i will be your slave
you wont deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said helene
the prince tried to comfort her but helene as if quite distraught
said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying
that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but she
mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had
never been her husbands wife and that she had been sacrificed
but the law religion said the prince already yielding
the law religion what have they been invented for if they cant
the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him
and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus
a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which helene gave at
her country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de jobert
a man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes a
jesuit a robe courte  was presented to her and in the garden by the
light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a
long time of the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of the
consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and
the next helene was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyes
and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled a dance
for which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse with
her future directeur de conscience but the next evening monsieur de
jobert came to see helene when she was alone and after that often came
one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she knelt
down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting middle aged
frenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterward
described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
soul it was explained to her that this was la grace
after that a long frocked abbe was brought to her she confessed to him
and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box
containing the sacred host which was left at her house for her to
partake of a few days later helene learned with pleasure that she had
now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the
pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document
all that was done around her and to her at this time all the attention
devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant
refined ways and the state of dove like purity she was now in she wore
only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure
but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and
as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
the better of cleverer ones helene having realized that the main
object of all these words and all this trouble was after converting her
to catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to
which she received indications before parting with her money insisted
that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
should be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely to
preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human
desires and with this aim in one of her talks with her father
confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she
they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the
scent of flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a white
dress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abbe a well fed
man with a plump clean shaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and white
hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to helene and with a subtle
smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty
occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
subject helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his
plump clean shaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected the
conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidently
enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of the
the course of the father confessors arguments ran as follows ignorant
of the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal
fidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state without
faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of
sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have
had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it
what did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial
sin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with
the object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the
but suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of her
bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i
cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me
the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was
delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupils progress but could
not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed
let us understand one another countess said he with a smile and
helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from the
ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making
difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter
so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society
she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the only
way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderly
magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage
with a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been but
helenes imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as
marrying a maiden had its effect on him too had helene herself shown
the least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause would
certainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecy
or shame on the contrary with good natured naivete she told her
intimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the prince
and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was
a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that helene wanted to be
divorced from her husband had such a report spread many would have
opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and
interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marry
the question was no longer whether this was possible but only which was
the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court there
were it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
such a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent
while the majority were interested in helenes good fortune and in the
question which match would be the more advantageous whether it was
right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not
discuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiser
than you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that
decision would be to risk exposing ones stupidity and incapacity to
only marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had come to petersburg that
summer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express an
opinion contrary to the general one meeting helene at a ball she
stopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence said in
her gruff voice so wives of living men have started marrying again
perhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have been
forestalled my dear it was thought of long ago it is done in all the
brothels and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her wide
sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round
though people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in
petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed
and repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposing
the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word
prince vasili who of late very often forgot what he had said and
repeated one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to his
helene i have a word to say to you and he would lead her aside
drawing her hand downward i have heard of certain projects
concerning you know well my dear child you know how your fathers
heart rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but my
dear child consult only your own heart that is all i have to say and
concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
bilibin who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man
and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
helene always has men friends who can never change into lovers once
gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering
listen bilibin said helene she always called friends of that sort
by their surnames and she touched his coat sleeve with her white
beringed fingers tell me as you would a sister what i ought to do
bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered with a
you are not taking me unawares you know said he as a true friend
i have thought and thought again about your affair you see if you
marry the prince he meant the younger man and he crooked one finger
you forever lose the chance of marrying the other and you will
displease the court besides you know there is some kind of
connection but if you marry the old count you will make his last days
happy and as widow of the grand the prince would no longer be making
a mesalliance by marrying you and bilibin smoothed out his forehead
thats a true friend said helene beaming and again touching
bilibins sleeve but i love them you know and dont want to distress
either of them i would give my life for the happiness of them both
bilibin shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that not even he could
une maitresse femme  thats what is called putting things squarely
she would like to be married to all three at the same time thought he
but tell me how will your husband look at the matter bilibin asked
his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so
oh he loves me so said helene who for some reason imagined that
pierre too loved her he will do anything for me
bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty
among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
marriage was helenes mother princess kuragina she was continually
tormented by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned a
subject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to the
idea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
and remarriage during a husbands lifetime and the priest told her that
it was impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel
which as it seemed to him plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
armed with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable she
drove to her daughters early one morning so as to find her alone
having listened to her mothers objections helene smiled blandly and
but it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
ah maman ne dites pas de betises vous ne comprenez rien dans ma
position jai des devoirs  said helene changing from russian in
which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear
 oh mamma dont talk nonsense you dont understand anything in my
oh mamma how is it you dont understand that the holy father who has
just then the lady companion who lived with helene came in to announce
that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her
non dites lui que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse contre
 no tell him i dont wish to see him i am furious with him for not
comtesse a tout peche misericorde  said a fair haired young man
with a long face and nose as he entered the room
the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young man who had
entered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter and
yes she is right thought the old princess all her convictions
dissipated by the appearance of his highness she is right but how is
it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so
simple she thought as she got into her carriage
by the beginning of august helenes affairs were clearly defined and she
wrote a letter to her husband who as she imagined loved her very
much informing him of her intention to marry nn and of her having
embraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all the
formalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him by
