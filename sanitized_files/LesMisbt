them jumped down into the courtyard of the bath house traversed it
pushed open the porters wicket beside which hung his rope pulled
this opened the porte cochere and found themselves in the street
three quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in
the dark nail in hand and their project in their heads
a few moments later they had joined babet and montparnasse who were
they had broken their rope in pulling it after them and a bit of it
remained attached to the chimney on the roof they had sustained no
other damage however than that of scratching nearly all the skin off
that night thenardier was warned without any one being able to explain
towards one oclock in the morning the night being very dark he saw
two shadows pass along the roof in the rain and squalls in front of
the dormer window which was opposite his cage one halted at the window
long enough to dart in a glance this was brujon
thenardier recognized him and understood this was enough
thenardier rated as a burglar and detained as a measure of precaution
under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush with armed force was
kept in sight the sentry who was relieved every two hours marched
up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket the fine air was
lighted by a skylight the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing
fifty pounds every day at four oclock in the afternoon a jailer
escorted by two dogs this was still in vogue at that time entered
his cage deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two
pounds a jug of water a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon in
which swam a few mayagan beans inspected his irons and tapped the bars
this man and his dogs made two visits during the night
thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he
used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve
it from the rats as he said as thenardier was kept in sight
no objection had been made to this spike still it was remembered
afterwards that one of the jailers had said it would be better to let
at two oclock in the morning the sentinel who was an old soldier was
relieved and replaced by a conscript a few moments later the man with
the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except
possibly the excessive youth and the rustic air of the raw recruit
two hours afterwards at four oclock when they came to relieve the
conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a log near
thenardiers cage as for thenardier he was no longer there there was
a hole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the
roof one of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off and probably
carried away with him as it was not found they also seized in his cell
a half empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine
with which the soldier had been drugged the soldiers bayonet had
at the moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that
thenardier was out of reach the truth is that he was no longer in the
new building but that he was still in great danger
thenardier on reaching the roof of the new building had found the
remains of brujons rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the
chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not
been able to escape by the outer wall as brujon and guelemer had done
when one turns from the rue des ballets into the rue du roi de sicile
one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin there stood on
that spot in the last century a house of which only the back wall now
remains a regular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the
third story between the adjoining buildings this ruin can be recognized
by two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle
one that nearest the right gable is barred with a worm eaten beam
adjusted like a prop through these windows there was formerly visible a
lofty and lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la
the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is
half filled by a fence of rotten boards shored up by five stone posts
in this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the
portion of the ruin which has remained standing the fence has a gate
which a few years ago was fastened only by a latch
it was the crest of this ruin that thenardier had succeeded in reaching
a little after one oclock in the morning
how had he got there that is what no one has ever been able to explain
or understand the lightning must at the same time have hindered
and helped him had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the
slaters to get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from
compartment to compartment to the buildings of the charlemagne court
then to the buildings of the saint louis court to the outer wall and
thence to the hut on the rue du roi de sicile but in that itinerary
there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility had
he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the
fine air to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping
of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut
but the outer wall of la force formed a crenellated and unequal line
it mounted and descended it dropped at the firemens barracks it rose
towards the bath house it was cut in twain by buildings it was not
even of the same height on the hotel lamoignon as on the rue pavee
everywhere occurred falls and right angles and then the sentinels must
have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence the route taken by
thenardier still remains rather inexplicable in two manners flight was
impossible had thenardier spurred on by that thirst for liberty which
changes precipices into ditches iron bars into wattles of osier a
legless man into an athlete a gouty man into a bird stupidity into
instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius had
thenardier invented a third mode no one has ever found out
the marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for the man who makes
his escape we repeat is inspired there is something of the star and
of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort towards
deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime
and one says of the escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that
wall in the same way that one says of corneille where did he find
at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his
clothes hanging in ribbons his hands flayed his elbows bleeding his
knees torn thenardier had reached what children in their figurative
language call the edge of the wall of the ruin there he had stretched
himself out at full length and there his strength had failed him a
steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of
the rope which he had was too short
there he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair which
he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling himself that
the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the
neighboring clock of saint paul strike four within a few minutes an
hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found
asleep under the pierced roof staring in horror at a terrible depth at
the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement
longed for yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty
he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded
if they had heard him and if they would come to his assistance he
listened with the exception of the patrol no one had passed through
the street since he had been there nearly the whole of the descent of
the market gardeners from montreuil from charonne from vincennes
and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue
four oclock struck thenardier shuddered a few moments later that
terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape
broke forth in the prison the sound of doors opening and shutting the
creaking of gratings on their hinges a tumult in the guard house the
hoarse shouts of the turnkeys the shock of musket butts on the pavement
of the courts reached his ears lights ascended and descended past the
grated windows of the dormitories a torch ran along the ridge pole of
the top story of the new building the firemen belonging in the barracks
on the right had been summoned their helmets which the torch lighted
up in the rain went and came along the roofs at the same time
thenardier perceived in the direction of the bastille a wan whiteness
lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise
he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy
rains with two gulfs to right and left unable to stir subject to the
giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of a certain arrest
and his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swung from one of these
ideas to the other dead if i fall caught if i stay in the midst of
this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark a man who
was gliding along the walls and coming from the rue pavee halt in the
recess above which thenardier was as it were suspended here this
man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution then by
a third then by a fourth when these men were re united one of them
lifted the latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered
the enclosure in which the shanty stood they halted directly under
thenardier these men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order
that they might consult without being seen by the passers by or by the
sentinel who guards the wicket of la force a few paces distant it
must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box
thenardier not being able to distinguish their visages lent an ear to
their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself
thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his
the first said in a low but distinct voice
lets cut what are we up to here
the second replied its raining hard enough to put out the very
devils fire and the bobbies will be along instanter theres a soldier
on guard yonder we shall get nabbed here
these two words icigo and icicaille both of which mean ici and which
belong the first to the slang of the barriers the second to the slang
of the temple were flashes of light for thenardier by the icigo he
recognized brujon who was a prowler of the barriers by the icicaille
he knew babet who among his other trades had been an old clothes
the antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in
the temple and babet was really the only person who spoke it in all
its purity had it not been for the icicaille thenardier would not have
recognized him for he had entirely changed his voice
in the meanwhile the third man had intervened
theres no hurry yet lets wait a bit how do we know that he doesnt
by this which was nothing but french thenardier recognized
montparnasse who made it a point in his elegance to understand all
as for the fourth he held his peace but his huge shoulders betrayed
him thenardier did not hesitate it was guelemer
brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone
what are you jabbering about the tavern keeper hasnt managed to cut
his stick he dont tumble to the racket that he dont you have to be
a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt cut up your sheet to make
a rope punch holes in doors get up false papers make false keys file
your irons hang out your cord hide yourself and disguise yourself
the old fellow hasnt managed to play it he doesnt understand how to
babet added still in that classical slang which was spoken by
poulailler and cartouche and which is to the bold new highly colored
and risky argot used by brujon what the language of racine is to the
your tavern keeper must have been nabbed in the act you have to be
knowing hes only a greenhorn he must have let himself be taken in
by a bobby perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal
listen montparnasse do you hear those shouts in the prison you have
seen all those lights hes recaptured there hell get off with twenty
years i aint afraid i aint a coward but there aint anything more
to do or otherwise theyd lead us a dance dont get mad come with us
lets go drink a bottle of old wine together
one doesnt desert ones friends in a scrape grumbled montparnasse
i tell you hes nabbed retorted brujon at the present moment the
inn keeper aint worth a hapenny we cant do nothing for him lets be
off every minute i think a bobby has got me in his fist
montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact
is that these four men with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon
each other had prowled all night long about la force great as was
their peril in the hope of seeing thenardier make his appearance on the
top of some wall but the night which was really growing too fine for
the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted the cold
which was overpowering them their soaked garments their hole ridden
shoes the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the
hours which had elapsed the patrol which they had encountered the
hope which was vanishing all urged them to beat a retreat montparnasse
himself who was perhaps almost thenardiers son in law yielded a
moment more and they would be gone thenardier was panting on his wall
like the shipwrecked sufferers of the meduse on their raft when they
beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon
he dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin everything an
idea occurred to him a last idea a flash of inspiration he drew from
his pocket the end of brujons rope which he had detached from the
chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the
they raised their eyes thenardier thrust out his head a very little
quick said montparnasse have you the other end of the rope
knot the two pieces together well fling him the rope he can fasten
it to the wall and hell have enough of it to get down with
then one of us must climb up said montparnasse
an ancient plaster flue which had served for a stove that had been used
in the shanty in former times ran along the wall and mounted almost
to the very spot where they could see thenardier this flue then much
damaged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are
one might get up by the help of that said montparnasse
by that flue exclaimed babet a grown up cove never it would take
where are we to find a young un said guelemer
wait said montparnasse ive got the very article
he opened the gate of the fence very softly made sure that no one was
passing along the street stepped out cautiously shut the gate behind
him and set off at a run in the direction of the bastille
seven or eight minutes elapsed eight thousand centuries to thenardier
babet brujon and guelemer did not open their lips at last the gate
opened once more and montparnasse appeared breathless and followed by
gavroche the rain still rendered the street completely deserted
little gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these
ruffians with a tranquil air the water was dripping from his hair
a young un like mes a man and men like you are babes
the paris brat aint made of straw added brujon
to the top of the wall went on babet
to the cross bar of the window added brujon
the gamin examined the rope the flue the wall the windows and made
that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies
theres a man up there whom you are to save resumed montparnasse
greenhorn replied the lad as though the question appeared a most
guelemer seized gavroche by one arm set him on the roof of the shanty
whose worm eaten planks bent beneath the urchins weight and handed
him the rope which brujon had knotted together during montparnasses
absence the gamin directed his steps towards the flue which it was
easy to enter thanks to a large crack which touched the roof at the
moment when he was on the point of ascending thenardier who saw life
and safety approaching bent over the edge of the wall the first light
of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat upon his livid
cheek bones his sharp and savage nose his bristling gray beard and
hullo its my father oh that wont hinder
and taking the rope in his teeth he resolutely began the ascent
he reached the summit of the hut bestrode the old wall as though it had
been a horse and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross bar of the
a moment later thenardier was in the street
as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as he found himself out
of danger he was no longer either weary or chilled or trembling the
terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that
strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free
it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent
remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder to
lets get well into a corner said brujon lets settle it in three
words and part at once there was an affair that promised well in the
rue plumet a deserted street an isolated house an old rotten gate on
your girl eponine went to see about the matter replied babet
and she brought a biscuit to magnon added guelemer nothing to be
the girls no fool said thenardier still it must be seen to
yes yes said brujon it must be looked up
in the meanwhile none of the men seemed to see gavroche who during
this colloquy had seated himself on one of the fence posts he waited
a few moments thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him
then he put on his shoes again and said
is that all you dont want any more my men now youre out of your
scrape im off i must go and get my brats out of bed
the five men emerged one after another from the enclosure
when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets
did you take a good look at that young un he asked
the one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope
well i dont know but it strikes me that it was your son
it engenders a whole world la pegre for which read theft and a hell
she has a son theft and a daughter hunger
where are we at this moment in the land of slang
what is slang it is at one and the same time a nation and a dialect
it is theft in its two kinds people and language
when four and thirty years ago the narrator of this grave and sombre
history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a
thief who talked argot there arose amazement and clamor what how
argot why argot is horrible it is the language of prisons galleys
convicts of everything that is most abominable in society etc etc
we have never understood this sort of objections
since that time two powerful romancers one of whom is a profound
observer of the human heart the other an intrepid friend of the people
balzac and eugene sue having represented their ruffians as talking
their natural language as the author of the last day of a condemned
man did in 1828 the same objections have been raised people repeated
what do authors mean by that revolting dialect slang is odious slang
when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when
has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom we have
always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a
simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty
accepted and fulfilled merits why should one not explore everything
and study everything why should one halt on the way the halt is a
matter depending on the sounding line and not on the leadsman
certainly too it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to
undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order
where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins to rummage in
those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to fling still
quivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with
filth when thus brought to the light that pustulous vocabulary each
word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the
shadows nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in
its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of
slang it seems in fact to be a sort of horrible beast made for the
night which has just been torn from its cesspool one thinks one beholds
a frightful living and bristling thicket which quivers rustles
wavers returns to shadow threatens and glares one word resembles a
claw another an extinguished and bleeding eye such and such a phrase
seems to move like the claw of a crab all this is alive with
the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of
now when has horror ever excluded study since when has malady banished
medicine can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the
bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would
cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is the
thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon
who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart he would be like
a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher
hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity for it must be stated
to those who are ignorant of the case that argot is both a literary
phenomenon and a social result what is slang properly speaking it is
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is
one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions
it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all
forms of intelligence have their own slang the merchant who says
montpellier not active marseilles fine quality the broker on change
who says assets at end of current month the gambler who says tiers
et tout refait de pique the sheriff of the norman isles who says
the holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the
fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate
by the mortgagor the playwright who says the piece was hissed
the comedian who says ive made a hit the philosopher who says
phenomenal triplicity the huntsman who says voileci allais
voileci fuyant the phrenologist who says amativeness combativeness
secretiveness the infantry soldier who says my shooting iron the
cavalry man who says my turkey cock the fencing master who says
tierce quarte break the printer who says my shooting stick and
galley all printer fencing master cavalry dragoon infantry man
gambler stock broker and merchant speak slang the painter who says
my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser
who says my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang
strictly speaking if one absolutely insists on the point all the
different fashions of saying the right and the left the sailors port
and starboard the scene shifters court side and garden side the
beadles gospel side and epistle side are slang there is the slang of
the affected lady as well as of the precieuses the hotel rambouillet
nearly adjoins the cour des miracles there is a slang of duchesses
witness this phrase contained in a love letter from a very great lady
and a very pretty woman of the restoration you will find in this
gossip a fultitude of reasons why i should libertize40 diplomatic
ciphers are slang the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for rome
grkztntgzyal for despatch and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu xi for the due de
modena speaks slang the physicians of the middle ages who for
sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common
burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang a certain school of
criticism twenty years ago which used to say half of the works of
shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns talked slang the
poet and the artist who with profound understanding would designate
m de montmorency as a bourgeois if he were not a judge of verses and
statues speak slang the classic academician who calls flowers flora
fruits pomona the sea neptune love fires beauty charms
a horse a courser the white or tricolored cockade the rose of
bellona the three cornered hat mars triangle that classical
academician talks slang algebra medicine botany have each their
slang the tongue which is employed on board ship that wonderful
language of the sea which is so complete and so picturesque which was
spoken by jean bart duquesne suffren and duperre which mingles with
the whistling of the rigging the sound of the speaking trumpets the
shock of the boarding irons the roll of the sea the wind the gale
the cannon is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang which is to the
fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal
no doubt but say what we will this manner of understanding the word
slang is an extension which every one will not admit for our part
we reserve to the word its ancient and precise circumscribed and
determined significance and we restrict slang to slang the veritable
slang and the slang that is pre eminently slang if the two words can be
coupled thus the slang immemorial which was a kingdom is nothing
else we repeat than the homely uneasy crafty treacherous venomous
cruel equivocal vile profound fatal tongue of wretchedness there
exists at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes a last
misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict
with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful
conflict where now cunning now violent unhealthy and ferocious
at one and the same time it attacks the social order with pin pricks
through vice and with club blows through crime to meet the needs of
this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were
it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would
otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of
which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend
the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself this
service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two
carthaginian soldiers talk phoenician that service moliere rendered
by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of
dialects here objections spring up afresh phoenician very good
levantine quite right even dialect let that pass they are tongues
which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang what is the use
of preserving slang what is the good of assisting slang to survive
to this we reply in one word only assuredly if the tongue which a
nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language
which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and
it is the language which has been spoken in france for example for
more than four centuries not only by a misery but by every possible
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and
infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy
is not a business in which choice is permitted the historian of manners
and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
the latter has the surface of civilization the conflicts of crowns the
births of princes the marriages of kings battles assemblages great
public men revolutions in the daylight everything on the exterior
the other historian has the interior the depths the people who toil
suffer wait the oppressed woman the agonizing child the secret war
between man and man obscure ferocities prejudices plotted
iniquities the subterranean the indistinct tremors of multitudes the
die of hunger the counter blows of the law the secret evolution of
souls the go bare foot the bare armed the disinherited the orphans
the unhappy and the infamous all the forms which roam through the
darkness he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity
at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable
casemates where crawl pell mell those who bleed and those who deal the
blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those
who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it have these
historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians
of external facts does any one think that alighieri has any fewer
things to say than machiavelli is the under side of civilization any
less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more
sombre do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted
let us say moreover parenthetically that from a few words of what
precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes
of historians which does not exist in our mind no one is a good
historian of the patent visible striking and public life of peoples
if he is not at the same time in a certain measure the historian
of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of the
interior unless he understands how at need to be the historian of the
exterior also the history of manners and ideas permeates the history
of events and this is true reciprocally they constitute two different
orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always
interlaced and which often bring forth results all the lineaments
which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels
sombre but distinct in their depths and all convulsions of the depths
produce ebullitions on the surface true history being a mixture of all
man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double
focus facts form one of these and ideas the other
slang is nothing but a dressing room where the tongue having some
bad action to perform disguises itself there it clothes itself in
word masks in metaphor rags in this guise it becomes horrible
one finds it difficult to recognize is it really the french tongue the
great human tongue behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort
upon crime and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of
evil it no longer walks it hobbles it limps on the crutch of the
court of miracles a crutch metamorphosable into a club it is called
vagrancy every sort of spectre its dressers have painted its face it
crawls and rears the double gait of the reptile henceforth it is apt
at all roles it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter covered with
verdigris by the forger blacked by the soot of the incendiary and the
when one listens by the side of honest men at the portals of society
one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside
one distinguishes questions and replies one perceives without
understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents
but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word it is slang
the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic
it is unintelligible in the dark it gnashes and whispers completing
the gloom with mystery it is black in misfortune it is blacker still
in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang obscurity
in the atmosphere obscurity in acts obscurity in voices terrible
toad like tongue which goes and comes leaps crawls slobbers and
stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain
and night of hunger of vice of falsehood of injustice of nudity of
suffocation and of winter the high noonday of the miserable
let us have compassion on the chastised alas who are we ourselves who
am i who now address you who are you who are listening to me and are
you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born the earth
is not devoid of resemblance to a jail who knows whether man is not a
recaptured offender against divine justice look closely at life it is
so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
are you what is called a happy man well you are sad every day each
day has its own great grief or its little care yesterday you were
trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your
own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow
the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some
friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken
or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral
column reproach you again the course of public affairs this without
reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on one cloud is
dispelled another forms there is hardly one day out of a hundred which
is wholly joyous and sunny and you belong to that small class who are
happy as for the rest of mankind stagnating night rests upon them
thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase the fortunate and
the unfortunate in this world evidently the vestibule of another
the real human division is this the luminous and the shady to diminish
the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that
is the object that is why we cry education science to teach reading
means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles
however he who says light does not necessarily say joy people suffer
in the light excess burns the flame is the enemy of the wing to burn
without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius
when you shall have learned to know and to love you will still suffer
the day is born in tears the luminous weep if only over those in
slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness
thought is moved in its most sombre depths social philosophy is bidden
to its most poignant meditations in the presence of that enigmatic
dialect at once so blighted and rebellious therein lies chastisement
made visible every syllable has an air of being marked the words of
the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled as it were
beneath the hot iron of the executioner some seem to be still smoking
such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a
thief branded with the fleur de lys which has suddenly been laid bare
ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are
fugitives from justice metaphor is sometimes so shameless that one
feels that it has worn the iron neck fetter
moreover in spite of all this and because of all this this strange
dialect has by rights its own compartment in that great impartial case
of pigeon holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as
for the gold medal and which is called literature slang whether the
public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry it is a
language yes by the deformity of certain terms we recognize the
fact that it was chewed by mandrin and by the splendor of certain
but where are the snows of years gone by
is a verse of slang antam ante annum is a word of thunes slang which
signified the past year and by extension formerly thirty five years
ago at the epoch of the departure of the great chain gang there could
be read in one of the cells at bicetre this maxim engraved with a
nail on the wall by a king of thunes condemned to the galleys les dabs
dantan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du coesre this means kings in
days gone by always went and had themselves anointed in the opinion of
the word decarade which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at
a gallop is attributed to villon and it is worthy of him this word
which strikes fire with all four of its feet sums up in a masterly
onomatopoeia the whole of la fontaines admirable verse
from a purely literary point of view few studies would prove more
curious and fruitful than the study of slang it is a whole language
within a language a sort of sickly excrescence an unhealthy graft
which has produced a vegetation a parasite which has its roots in the
old gallic trunk and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of
the language this is what may be called the first the vulgar aspect of
slang but for those who study the tongue as it should be studied that
is to say as geologists study the earth slang appears like a veritable
alluvial deposit according as one digs a longer or shorter distance

in addition to the philological origins just indicated slang possesses
other and still more natural roots which spring so to speak from the
in the first place the direct creation of words therein lies the
mystery of tongues to paint with words which contains figures
one knows not how or why is the primitive foundation of all human
slang abounds in words of this description immediate words words
created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom without
sometimes hideous words which at times possess a singular power of
expression and which live the executioner le taule the forest
le sabri fear flight taf the lackey le larbin the mineral
the prefect the minister pharos the devil le rabouin nothing is
stranger than these words which both mask and reveal some le rabouin
for example are at the same time grotesque and terrible and produce on
in the second place metaphor the peculiarity of a language which is
desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures
metaphor is an enigma wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke
the prisoner who is arranging an escape take refuge no idiom is more
metaphorical than slang devisser le coco to unscrew the nut to twist
the neck tortiller to wriggle to eat etre gerbe to be tried a
rat a bread thief il lansquine it rains a striking ancient figure
which partly bears its date about it which assimilates long oblique
lines of rain with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers and
which compresses into a single word the popular expression it rains
halberds sometimes in proportion as slang progresses from the first
epoch to the second words pass from the primitive and savage sense to
the metaphorical sense the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes
le boulanger the baker who puts the bread into the oven this is
more witty but less grand something like racine after corneille like
euripides after aeschylus certain slang phrases which participate
in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the
solliciter des gails a la lune the prowlers are going to steal horses
by night this passes before the mind like a group of spectres one
in the third place the expedient slang lives on the language it uses
it in accordance with its fancy it dips into it hap hazard and it
often confines itself when occasion arises to alter it in a gross and
summary fashion occasionally with the ordinary words thus deformed and
complicated with words of pure slang picturesque phrases are formed in
which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements the
direct creation and the metaphor le cab jaspine je marronne que la
roulotte de pantin trime dans le sabri the dog is barking i suspect
that the diligence for paris is passing through the woods le dab est
sinve la dabuge est merloussiere la fee est bative the bourgeois is
stupid the bourgeoise is cunning the daughter is pretty generally
to throw listeners off the track slang confines itself to adding to
all the words of the language without distinction an ignoble tail a
termination in aille in orgue in iergue or in uche thus vousiergue
trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche do you think that leg of mutton
good a phrase addressed by cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out
whether the sum offered for his escape suited him
the termination in mar has been added recently
slang being the dialect of corruption quickly becomes corrupted
itself besides this as it is always seeking concealment as soon as
it feels that it is understood it changes its form contrary to what
happens with every other vegetation every ray of light which falls
upon it kills whatever it touches thus slang is in constant process of
decomposition and recomposition an obscure and rapid work which never
pauses it passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten
centuries thus le larton bread becomes le lartif le gail horse
becomes le gaye la fertanche straw becomes la fertille le momignard
brat le momacque les fiques duds frusques la chique the
church legrugeoir le colabre neck le colas the devil is at
first gahisto then le rabouin then the baker the priest is a
ratichon then the boar le sanglier the dagger is le vingt deux
twenty two then le surin then le lingre the police are railles
then roussins then rousses then marchands de lacets dealers in
stay laces then coquers then cognes the executioner is le taule
then charlot latigeur then le becquillard in the seventeenth
century to fight was to give each other snuff in the nineteenth
it is to chew each others throats there have been twenty different
phrases between these two extremes cartouches talk would have been
hebrew to lacenaire all the words of this language are perpetually
engaged in flight like the men who utter them
still from time to time and in consequence of this very movement
the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more it has its
headquarters where it maintains its sway the temple preserved the slang
of the seventeenth century bicetre when it was a prison preserved the
slang of thunes there one could hear the termination in anche of
the old thuneurs boyanches tu bois tu do you drink but perpetual
if the philosopher succeeds in fixing for a moment for purposes of
observation this language which is incessantly evaporating he falls
into doleful and useful meditation no study is more efficacious and
more fecund in instruction there is not a metaphor not an analogy in
slang which does not contain a lesson among these men to beat means
to feign one beats a malady ruse is their strength
for them the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of
darkness the night is called la sorgue man lorgue man is a
they have taken up the practice of considering society in the light
of an atmosphere which kills them of a fatal force and they speak of
their liberty as one would speak of his health a man under arrest is a
sick man one who is condemned is a dead man
the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which
he is buried is a sort of glacial chastity and he calls the dungeon
the castus in that funereal place life outside always presents itself
under its most smiling aspect the prisoner has irons on his feet you
think perhaps that his thought is that it is with the feet that one
walks no he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so
when he has succeeded in severing his fetters his first idea is that
now he can dance and he calls the saw the bastringue public house
ball a name is a centre profound assimilation the ruffian has two
heads one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life
long and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his
death he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne
and the head which expiates it la tronche when a man has no longer
anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart when he has
arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word
blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations he is ripe for crime
he is like a well whetted knife he has two cutting edges his
distress and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard it says
un reguise what are the galleys a brazier of damnation a hell the
convict calls himself a fagot and finally what name do malefactors
give to their prison the college a whole penitentiary system can be
does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the
galleys those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa have
there existed at the chatelet in paris a large and long cellar this
cellar was eight feet below the level of the seine it had neither
windows nor air holes its only aperture was the door men could enter
there air could not this vault had for ceiling a vault of stone and
for floor ten inches of mud it was flagged but the pavement had rotted
and cracked under the oozing of the water eight feet above the floor
a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side
to side from this beam hung at short distances apart chains three
feet long and at the end of these chains there were rings for the
neck in this vault men who had been condemned to the galleys were
incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon they were
thrust under this beam where each one found his fetters swinging in the
the chains those pendant arms and the necklets those open hands
caught the unhappy wretches by the throat they were rivetted and
left there as the chain was too short they could not lie down they
remained motionless in that cavern in that night beneath that beam
almost hanging forced to unheard of efforts to reach their bread jug
or their vault overhead mud even to mid leg filth flowing to their
very calves broken asunder with fatigue with thighs and knees giving
way clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some
