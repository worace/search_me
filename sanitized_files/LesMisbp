that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two
green and moss covered pillars and oddly crowned with a pediment of
there was a stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues
several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting on
the wall and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass
everywhere gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned
weeds abounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of
land the festival of gilliflowers was something splendid nothing
in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life
venerable growth reigned there among them the trees had bent over
towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had
inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that
which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over
towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres
clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed
married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep
and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the
well pleased eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet
square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity
this garden was no longer a garden it was a colossal thicket that is
to say something as impenetrable as a forest as peopled as a city
quivering like a nest sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet
solitary as a tomb living as a throng
in floreal34 this enormous thicket free behind its gate and within
its four walls entered upon the secret labor of germination quivered
in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of
cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in
its veins and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks
sprinkled on the damp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling
steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street
flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy
perfumes at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and
it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about
there in flakes amid the shade there in those gay shadows of verdure
a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the
twittering forgot to say the humming completed in the evening a dreamy
vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a
calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the
honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an
exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and
the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the
sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the
leaves by night the leaves protect the wings
in winter the thicket was black dripping bristling shivering and
allowed some glimpse of the house instead of flowers on the branches
and dew in the flowers the long silvery tracks of the snails were
visible on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion
under any aspect at all seasons spring winter summer autumn this
liberty the absence of man the presence of god and the rusty old gate
had the air of saying this garden belongs to me
it was of no avail that the pavements of paris were there on every side
the classic and splendid hotels of the rue de varennes a couple of paces
away the dome of the invalides close at hand the chamber of deputies
not far off the carriages of the rue de bourgogne and of the rue
saint dominique rumbled luxuriously in vain in the vicinity in vain
did the yellow brown white and red omnibuses cross each others
course at the neighboring cross roads the rue plumet was the desert
and the death of the former proprietors the revolution which had passed
over it the crumbling away of ancient fortunes absence forgetfulness
forty years of abandonment and widowhood had sufficed to restore to
this privileged spot ferns mulleins hemlock yarrow tall weeds great
crimped plants with large leaves of pale green cloth lizards beetles
uneasy and rapid insects to cause to spring forth from the depths
of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain
indescribable and savage grandeur and for nature which disconcerts
the petty arrangements of man and which sheds herself always thoroughly
where she diffuses herself at all in the ant as well as in the eagle
to blossom out in a petty little parisian garden with as much rude force
and majesty as in a virgin forest of the new world
nothing is small in fact any one who is subject to the profound
and penetrating influence of nature knows this although no absolute
satisfaction is given to philosophy either to circumscribe the cause
or to limit the effect the contemplator falls into those unfathomable
ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity
algebra is applied to the clouds the radiation of the star profits
the rose no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the
hawthorn is useless to the constellations who then can calculate the
course of a molecule how do we know that the creation of worlds is not
determined by the fall of grains of sand who knows the reciprocal
ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little the
reverberations of causes in the precipices of being and the avalanches
of creation the tiniest worm is of importance the great is little the
little is great everything is balanced in necessity alarming vision
for the mind there are marvellous relations between beings and things
in that inexhaustible whole from the sun to the grub nothing despises
the other all have need of each other the light does not bear away
terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths without knowing what it is
doing the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers
all birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite
germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with
the peck of a swallow cracking its egg and it places on one level the
birth of an earthworm and the advent of socrates where the telescope
ends the microscope begins which of the two possesses the larger field
of vision choose a bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers a nebula is an
ant hill of stars the same promiscuousness and yet more unprecedented
exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of
substance elements and principles mingle combine wed multiply with
each other to such a point that the material and the moral world are
brought eventually to the same clearness the phenomenon is perpetually
returning upon itself in the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life
goes and comes in unknown quantities rolling entirely in the invisible
mystery of effluvia employing everything not losing a single dream
not a single slumber sowing an animalcule here crumbling to bits a
planet there oscillating and winding making of light a force and of
thought an element disseminated and invisible dissolving all
except that geometrical point the i bringing everything back to the
soul atom expanding everything in god entangling all activity from
summit to base in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism attaching the
flight of an insect to the movement of the earth subordinating who
knows were it only by the identity of the law the evolution of the
comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop
of water a machine made of mind enormous gearing the prime motor of
which is the gnat and whose final wheel is the zodiac
it seemed that this garden created in olden days to conceal wanton
mysteries had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste
mysteries there were no longer either arbors or bowling greens or
tunnels or grottos there was a magnificent dishevelled obscurity
falling like a veil over all paphos had been made over into eden it is
impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat
wholesome this flower girl now offered her blossom to the soul this
coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to
virginity and modesty a justice assisted by a gardener a goodman who
thought that he was a continuation of lamoignon and another goodman who
thought that he was a continuation of lenotre had turned it about cut
ruffled decked moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of
it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love
there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready love
had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure
grass moss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and
a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration
cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was
a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful age we
have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely
rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature but she was awkward
thin timid and bold at once a grown up little girl in short
her education was finished that is to say she has been taught
religion and even and above all devotion then history that is to
say the thing that bears that name in convents geography grammar
the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing
etc but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a
great charm and a great peril the soul of a young girl should not be
left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively
are formed there as in a dark chamber she should be gently and
discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than
with their harsh and direct light a useful and graciously austere
half light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls there is
nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of
the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows
how this half light is to be created and of what it should consist
nothing supplies the place of this instinct all the nuns in the world
are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girls
cosette had had no mother she had only had many mothers in the plural
as for jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but
he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all
now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a
woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance
nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent the convent
turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown the heart thus
thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it cannot
overflow and grows deep since it cannot expand hence visions
suppositions conjectures outlines of romances a desire for
adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner
obscurity of the mind sombre and secret abodes where the passions
immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to
enter the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the
human heart should last during the whole life
on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and
more dangerous than the house in the rue plumet it was the continuation
of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed but
a nature that was acrid rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dreams
as in the convent but with glimpses of young men a grating but one
still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child jean
valjean gave this neglected garden over to her do what you like with
it he said to her this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps
and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while
awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden
for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while
awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see
and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with
all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman
a beloved and charming companion to her it will be remembered that m
madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal jean valjean
had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed
the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has
spontaneously cultivated itself he retained just enough sharpness to
season his kindness his mind was rough and his heart was soft during
their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of
everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had
suffered as she listened to him cosettes eyes wandered vaguely about
this simple man sufficed for cosettes thought the same as the wild
garden sufficed for her eyes when she had had a good chase after the
butterflies she came panting up to him and said ah how i have run
cosette adored the goodman she was always at his heels where jean
valjean was there happiness was jean valjean lived neither in the
pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back
courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little
lodge furnished with straw seated chairs than in the great drawing room
hung with tapestry against which stood tufted easy chairs jean valjean
sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being importuned do
go to your own quarters leave me alone a little
she gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful
when they come from a daughter to her father
father i am very cold in your rooms why dont you have a carpet here
dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have
then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed
because you are a woman and a child
bah must men be cold and feel uncomfortable
that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to
father why do you eat horrible bread like that
well if you eat it i will eat it too
then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean ate
cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood she prayed
morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known the
thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream she
remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water in a
forest she thought that it had been very far from paris it seemed to
her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean
who had rescued her from it her childhood produced upon her the effect
of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds spiders
and serpents when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep
as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean valjeans daughter
and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had
passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her
when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and
dropped a silent tear saying to herself perhaps this man is my
cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound
ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also
absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she
had had as little mother as possible she did not even know her mothers
name whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent if
she repeated her question he responded with a smile once she insisted
this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantine with darkness
was it prudence was it respect was it a fear that he should deliver
this name to the hazards of another memory than his own
so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk
to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible
for him to do so it seemed to him that he no longer dared was it
because of cosette was it because of fantine he felt a certain
religious horror at letting that shadow enter cosettes thought and of
placing a third in their destiny the more sacred this shade was to him
the more did it seem that it was to be feared he thought of fantine
through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared
to have its finger on its lips had all the modesty which had been
in fantine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime
returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over
the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her
grave was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure we
who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this
hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of
father i saw my mother in a dream last night she had two big wings
my mother must have been almost a saint during her life
when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy
in the plenitude of her heart jean valjean felt his heart melt within
him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so
wholly satisfied with himself alone the poor man trembled inundated
with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would
last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered
sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss and he thanked god in the
depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he a
chapter v the rose perceives that it is an engine of war
one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said
to herself really it seemed to her almost that she was pretty this
threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind up to that moment she
had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she
did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she
was homely jean valjean alone said gently no indeed no indeed at
all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up
in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood and here all
at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said no
indeed that night she did not sleep what if i were pretty she
thought how odd it would be if i were pretty and she recalled those
of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent
and she said to herself what am i to be like mademoiselle so and so
the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time
and she was assailed with doubts where did i get such an idea said
she no i am ugly she had not slept well that was all her eyes
were sunken and she was pale she had not felt very joyous on the
preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her
very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer she did not look at
herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair
in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or
did some convent needlework in the drawing room and jean valjean read
beside her once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered
quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her
on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed
to her that some one behind her whom she did not see said a pretty
woman but badly dressed bah she thought he does not mean me
i am well dressed and ugly she was then wearing a plush hat and her
at last one day when she was in the garden she heard poor old
toussaint saying do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir
cosette did not hear her fathers reply but toussaints words caused
a sort of commotion within her she fled from the garden ran up to
her room flew to the looking glass it was three months since she
had looked at herself and gave vent to a cry she had just dazzled
she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint
and her mirror her figure was formed her skin had grown white her
hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue
eyes the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like
the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint
had said so it was evidently she of whom the passer by had spoken
there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden
again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds
singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among
the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible
jean valjean on his side experienced a deep and undefinable oppression
in fact he had for some time past been contemplating with terror that
beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosettes sweet
face the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him
cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became
aware of it herself but from the very first day that unexpected light
which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girls
person wounded jean valjeans sombre eye he felt that it was a change
in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear
of disarranging something this man who had passed through all manner
of distresses who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who
had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after
having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible
but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not
released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and
brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of
public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and
merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature
of the world one thing that cosette might love him
that cosette might continue to love him that god would not prevent
the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him
beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded
with benefits recompensed crowned beloved by cosette it was well
with him he asked nothing more had any one said to him do you want
anything better he would have answered no god might have said to
him do you desire heaven and he would have replied i should lose
everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface
made him shudder like the beginning of something new he had never
known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he
he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more
triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent
and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her homeliness of
his old age of his misery of his reprobation
he said to himself how beautiful she is what is to become of me
there moreover lay the difference between his tenderness and the
tenderness of a mother what he beheld with anguish a mother would have
the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance
on the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself
decidedly i am beautiful cosette began to pay attention to her
toilet she recalled the remark of that passer by pretty but badly
dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had
vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are
destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquetry love is
with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her
she conceived a horror for her merinos and shame for her plush hat her
father had never refused her anything she at once acquired the whole
science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the
stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science
which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so
dangerous the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne
in less than a month little cosette in that thebaid of the rue de
babylone was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best
dressed women in paris which means a great deal more
she would have liked to encounter her passer by to see what he would
say and to teach him a lesson the truth is that she was ravishing
in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a
bonnet from gerard and one from herbaut in the most marvellous way
jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety he who felt that
he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings
moreover from the mere inspection of cosettes toilet a woman
would have recognized the fact that she had no mother certain little
proprieties certain special conventionalities were not observed by
cosette a mother for instance would have told her that a young girl
the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle
and her white crape bonnet she took jean valjeans arm gay radiant
rosy proud dazzling father she said how do you like me in this
guise jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice
of an envious man charming he was the same as usual during their
walk on their return home he asked cosette
wont you put on that other gown and bonnet again you know the ones i
this took place in cosettes chamber cosette turned towards the
wardrobe where her cast off schoolgirls clothes were hanging
that disguise said she father what do you want me to do with it
oh no the idea i shall never put on those horrors again with that
machine on my head i have the air of madame mad dog
from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always
heretofore asked to remain at home saying father i enjoy myself more
here with you now was always asking to go out in fact what is the
use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not
he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back
garden now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade
back and forth in front of the railed fence jean valjean who was shy
never set foot in the garden he kept to his back yard like a dog
cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace
of ignoring it an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness
is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent
creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise
without being conscious of it but what she had lost in ingenuous grace
she gained in pensive and serious charm her whole person permeated
with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a
it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her
cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire
destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together
these two beings all charged and all languishing with the stormy
electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as
two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow
and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire
the glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally
fallen into disrepute one hardly dares to say nowadays that two
beings fell in love because they looked at each other that is the way
people do fall in love nevertheless and the only way the rest is
nothing but the rest comes afterwards nothing is more real than these
great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of
at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance
which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched
he caused her the same good and the same evil
she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had
scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere
marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to
think marius handsome but as he paid no attention to her the young man
still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had
beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice
when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself
badly when he walked if you like but with a grace that was all his
own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person
was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed
to be poor yet his air was fine
on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those
first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisps cosette did
not immediately understand she returned thoughtfully to the house in
the rue de louest where jean valjean according to his custom had
come to spend six weeks the next morning on waking she thought of
that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to
pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention
was the least in the world agreeable to her she was on the contrary
somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual a
substratum of war stirred within her it struck her and the idea caused
her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at
knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though
in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon women play with
their beauty as children do with a knife they wound themselves
the reader will recall marius hesitations his palpitations his
terrors he remained on his bench and did not approach this vexed
cosette one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about
a little in that direction seeing that marius did not come to her
she went to him in such cases all women resemble mahomet and then
strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is
timidity in a young girl it is boldness this is surprising and yet
nothing is more simple it is the two sexes tending to approach each
that day cosettes glance drove marius beside himself and marius
glance set cosette to trembling marius went away confident and cosette
uneasy from that day forth they adored each other
the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound
melancholy it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the
day before she no longer recognized it the whiteness of soul in young
girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow it
cosette did not know what love was she had never heard the word uttered
in its terrestrial sense on the books of profane music which entered
the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pandour
this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls
such as ah how delightful is the drum or pity is not a pandour but
cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much
with the drum therefore she did not know what name to give to what
she now felt is any one the less ill because one does not know the name
she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly she
did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or
dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved she
would have been greatly astonished had any one said to her you do not
sleep but that is forbidden you do not eat why that is very bad you
have oppressions and palpitations of the heart that must not be you
blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the
end of a certain green walk but that is abominable she would not have
understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in
a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing
it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to
the state of her soul it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute
contemplation the deification of a stranger it was the apparition of
youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining
a dream the longed for phantom realized and made flesh at last but
having as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exigence nor
defect in a word the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a
chimaera with a form any nearer and more palpable meeting would have
alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in
the exaggerated mists of the cloister she had all the fears of children
and all the fears of nuns combined the spirit of the convent with
which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in
the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything
tremble around her in this situation he was not a lover he was not
even an admirer he was a vision she set herself to adoring marius as
as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry she smiled at him with
every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with
impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy
and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought
marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another they did not
address each other they did not salute each other they did not know
each other they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are
separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other
it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed
beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in
ignorance of her love she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance
chapter vii to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half
all situations have their instincts old and eternal mother nature
warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius jean valjean
shuddered to the very bottom of his soul jean valjean saw nothing knew
nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness
in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in
process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling
away marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god
by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of
the father nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes
espied him marius manners were no longer in the least natural he
exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring he no longer came quite
close to them as formerly he seated himself at a distance and pretended
to be reading why did he pretend that formerly he had come in his old
coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure
that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore
gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man
cosette allowed nothing to be divined without knowing just what was the
matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and
there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had
recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by
that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean it might be
accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident
he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger one day
however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague
despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he
said to her what a very pedantic air that young man has
cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have
replied why no he is charming ten years later with the love
of marius in her heart she would have answered a pedant and
insufferable to the sight you are right at the moment in life
and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with
as though she now beheld him for the first time in her life
how stupid i am thought jean valjean she had not noticed him it is
i who have pointed him out to her
oh simplicity of the old oh the depth of children
it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of
those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles
that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap
whatever and that the young man falls into every one jean valjean
had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with
the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine jean
valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed
his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg
marius dashed headlong into all these snares and to all the
interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he
ingenuously answered yes but cosette remained immured in her apparent
unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean
arrived at the following conclusion that ninny is madly in love with
cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists
none the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor the minute
when cosette would love might strike at any moment does not everything
only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him he rose from his
seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what
jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he
did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things
he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet
to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated
marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all
the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on
marius flashing and terrible eyes he who had finally come to believe
himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when
marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and
ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which
had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up
against that young man it almost seemed to him that unknown craters
what he was there that creature what was he there for he came
creeping about smelling out examining trying he came saying hey
why not he came to prowl about his jean valjeans life to prowl
about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away
jean valjean added yes thats it what is he in search of an
adventure what does he want a love affair a love affair and i what
i have been first the most wretched of men and then the most unhappy
and i have traversed sixty years of life on my knees i have suffered
everything that man can suffer i have grown old without having been
young i have lived without a family without relatives without
friends without life without children i have left my blood on every
stone on every bramble on every mile post along every wall i have
been gentle though others have been hard to me and kind although
others have been malicious i have become an honest man once more in
spite of everything i have repented of the evil that i have done and
have forgiven the evil that has been done to me and at the moment
when i receive my recompense at the moment when it is all over at the
moment when i am just touching the goal at the moment when i have what
i desire it is well it is good i have paid i have earned it all
this is to take flight all this will vanish and i shall lose cosette
and i shall lose my life my joy my soul because it has pleased a
great booby to come and lounge at the luxembourg
then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam
it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy
surveying an enemy it was a dog scanning a thief
the reader knows the rest marius pursued his senseless course one day
he followed cosette to the rue de louest another day he spoke to
the porter the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean
monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you on the
morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last
perceived a week later jean valjean had taken his departure he swore
to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg
or in the rue de louest he returned to the rue plumet
cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she
did not seek to learn his reasons she had already reached the point
where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying herself jean
valjean had no experience of these miseries the only miseries which
are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the
consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of
he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy on his
side and on hers inexperience had joined issue
once he made a trial he asked cosette
would you like to come to the luxembourg
they went thither three months had elapsed marius no longer went
on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again
would you like to come to the luxembourg
jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and heart broken at this
what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so
impenetrable what was on its way there within what was taking place
in cosettes soul sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean
remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed
whole nights asking himself what has cosette in her mind and in
thinking of the things that she might be thinking about
oh at such moments what mournful glances did he cast towards that
cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible
glacier of virtue how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that
convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where
all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven how he adored that
eden forever closed against him whence he had voluntarily and madly
emerged how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought
cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled
to the earth by his very self devotion how he said to himself what
however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette no ill temper
no harshness his face was always serene and kind jean valjeans
manners were more tender and more paternal than ever if anything could
have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased suavity
on her side cosette languished she suffered from the absence of marius
as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being
conscious of it when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary
strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her
heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and
that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father
would take her thither once more but days weeks months elapsed jean
valjean had tacitly accepted cosettes tacit consent she regretted it
it was too late so marius had disappeared all was over the day on
which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there what
was to be done should she ever find him again she felt an anguish at
her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no
longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or
shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for
dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than
the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home
was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had done her
marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive
to but a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by
night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished
however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this
she still wore her sweet face for him
this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean
she replied there is nothing the matter with me
and after a silence when she divined that he was sad also she would
and you father is there anything wrong with you
these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so
touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other
now suffered side by side each on the others account without
acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and
jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two youth even in its
at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile it is
the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear he
had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was escaping from him he
would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by
some external and brilliant matter these ideas puerile as we have
just said and at the same time senile conveyed to him by their very
childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on
the imaginations of young girls he once chanced to see a general on
horseback in full uniform pass along the street comte coutard the
commandant of paris he envied that gilded man what happiness it
would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an
incontestable thing and if cosette could behold him thus she would be
dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the
tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice
for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men
an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections
in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell
in the rue plumet they had contracted one habit they sometimes took
a pleasure trip to see the sun rise a mild species of enjoyment which
befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it
for those who love solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent
to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added the streets
are deserted and the birds are singing cosette a bird herself liked
to rise early these matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding
evening he proposed and she agreed it was arranged like a plot they
set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for
jean valjeans inclination led him as we have seen to the least
frequented spots to solitary nooks to forgotten places there then
existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of poor
meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in
summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been
gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but
peeled jean valjean loved to haunt these fields cosette was not bored
there it meant solitude to him and liberty to her there she became a
little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her
hat laid it on jean valjeans knees and gathered bunches of flowers
she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them
gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who
cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on
the wing of a butterfly she wove garlands of poppies which she placed
on her head and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing
until they flamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers
even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early
one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of
the autumn of 1831 they set out and found themselves at break of
day near the barriere du maine it was not dawn it was daybreak a
delightful and stern moment a few constellations here and there in the
deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white a quiver
amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight a
lark which seemed mingled with the stars was carolling at a prodigious
height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed
immensity in the east the valde grace projected its dark mass on the
clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant
was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape
all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray
laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were on their way to
jean valjean was sitting in a cross walk on some planks deposited at the
gate of a timber yard his face was turned towards the highway his back
towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of
rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the
mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are
equivalent to four walls there are meditations which may be called
vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return
to earth jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries he was
thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came
between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a
light which was but the emanation of her soul he was almost happy in
his revery cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the
all at once cosette exclaimed father i should think some one was
cosette was right the causeway which leads to the ancient barriere du
maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sevres
and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the
causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a
noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of
confused pile made its appearance some shapeless thing which was coming
from the boulevard was turning into the road
it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was
bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could
not be distinctly made out there were horses wheels shouts whips
were cracking by degrees the outlines became fixed although bathed
in shadows it was a vehicle in fact which had just turned from the
boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards
the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect
followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their
appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of
the wagon in front figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were
visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there a
clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as
this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned
into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams
as it drew nearer it assumed a form and was outlined behind the trees
