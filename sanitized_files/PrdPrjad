i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley
if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed
for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to
the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet
as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to
the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a
ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look
and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
less on any single event or any particular person for though they
each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball
was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if
he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to
i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball
of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people
can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing
myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially
a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause and not to any disrespect for her
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being
engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins
instead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no help
for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose
to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and
till he did it was useless to quarrel about him
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the
younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton
once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very
shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than
usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys
pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though
this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who
told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by
elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make
attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away
with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her
spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had
not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular
notice the first two dances however brought a return of distress
they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn
apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being
aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with
her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that
without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again
immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
i dare say you will find him very agreeable
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her
hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no
answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and
reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding
it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made
some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again
silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time
with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked
about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of
some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial
taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure
said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you
i must not decide on my own performance
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist
the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself
for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a
constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth
with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very
superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the
first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not
disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated
especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at
her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then
flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir
williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly
he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made
i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we
are to talk of next i cannot imagine
what think you of books said he smiling
books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be
no want of subject we may compare our different opinions
no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy
that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was
unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being
i am said he with a firm voice
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion
to be secure of judging properly at first
may i ask to what these questions tend
merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring
to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out
she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different
i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree
for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand
questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among
his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late
mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys
using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has
always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated
mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but
i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he
cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you
miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really
considering his descent one could not expect much better
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said
elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer
insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr
darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for
wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way
before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her
sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of
his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct
the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has
received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters
mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has
been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard
mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am
satisfied but what does he say of the living
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard
them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr
bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr
bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady
catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have
thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to
do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in
consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity
and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that
i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to
perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the
words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time
to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however
was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my
reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered
me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very
handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of
endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to
venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to
supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely
openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon
be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but
three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger
daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs
bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers
words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be for you
to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of
tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and
she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty
preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance
but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks
of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was
weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at
jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to
bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs
of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however
imperturbably grave she looked at her father to entreat his
interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint
and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do
extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and
elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid
her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i
should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an
air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the
rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care
and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit
him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many
smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his
wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly
and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by
mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her
power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and
good naturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself
she was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further notice
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite
disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by
a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said
nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord
how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and
addressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without
the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought
with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his
declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on
finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together
soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs
bennet answered instantly oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy
will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i
want you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening
dear madam do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse
me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i am
no no nonsense lizzy i desire you to stay where you are and upon
elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to
escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to
conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from
doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of
my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife as i certainly did
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away
with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought
to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked
too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you
must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose
a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active
useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small
income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as
you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the
way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice
and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i
can assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that
being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place which however as i have already said may not
be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and
i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers
decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head
therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no
answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the
hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
could make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins
very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you and you may be certain when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you
must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment
of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by
refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may
be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she
thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thus
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me
exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for
believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections
with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are
circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me
i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females
i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but
to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect
forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward
gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of
to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make
no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she
entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be
brought to reason i will speak to her about it directly she is a very
headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if
she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of
temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and
we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her
husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet you
are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make
lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had
finished her speech of what are you talking
of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business
speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion
mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for
you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made
you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your
accepting it is it not so mrs bennet
yes or i will never see her again
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning
but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
what do you mean mr bennet in talking this way you promised me to
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did
mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again
coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane
in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other
way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to
her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such
fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has
made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him
charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on
the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone
for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used
charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided
she can have her own way but i tell you miss lizzy if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way
you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep
you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told
you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again
and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking
to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it
is always so those who do not complain are never pitied
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of
them till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to
the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold
your tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversation
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but
lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte
detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little
curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment
and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all
liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner
has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise
the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly
expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke
to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill
health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on
saturday and to saturday he meant to stay
