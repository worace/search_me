addressed to him by an old woman of the people who called to him from
her threshold in an angry way a good mayor is a useful thing is he
drawing back before the good which he can do
this was the third phase of his ascent father madeleine had become
monsieur madeleine monsieur madeleine became monsieur le maire
on the other hand he remained as simple as on the first day he had
gray hair a serious eye the sunburned complexion of a laborer the
thoughtful visage of a philosopher he habitually wore a hat with a
wide brim and a long coat of coarse cloth buttoned to the chin he
fulfilled his duties as mayor but with that exception he lived in
solitude he spoke to but few people he avoided polite attentions
he escaped quickly he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of
talking he gave in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling the
women said of him what a good natured bear his pleasure consisted in
he always took his meals alone with an open book before him which he
read he had a well selected little library he loved books books
are cold but safe friends in proportion as leisure came to him with
fortune he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind it had
been observed that ever since his arrival at m sur m his language
had grown more polished more choice and more gentle with every passing
year he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls but he rarely
made use of it when he did happen to do so his shooting was something
so infallible as to inspire terror he never killed an inoffensive
animal he never shot at a little bird
although he was no longer young it was thought that he was still
prodigiously strong he offered his assistance to any one who was in
need of it lifted a horse released a wheel clogged in the mud or
stopped a runaway bull by the horns he always had his pockets full
of money when he went out but they were empty on his return when he
passed through a village the ragged brats ran joyously after him and
it was thought that he must in the past have lived a country life
since he knew all sorts of useful secrets which he taught to the
peasants he taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat by sprinkling it
and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution
of common salt and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in
bloom everywhere on the walls and the ceilings among the grass and in
he had recipes for exterminating from a field blight tares foxtail
and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat he defended a rabbit
warren against rats simply by the odor of a guinea pig which he placed
one day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles
he examined the plants which were uprooted and already dried and said
they are dead nevertheless it would be a good thing to know how to
make use of them when the nettle is young the leaf makes an excellent
vegetable when it is older it has filaments and fibres like hemp and
flax nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth chopped up nettles are
good for poultry pounded they are good for horned cattle the seed of
the nettle mixed with fodder gives gloss to the hair of animals the
root mixed with salt produces a beautiful yellow coloring matter
moreover it is an excellent hay which can be cut twice and what is
required for the nettle a little soil no care no culture only the
seed falls as it is ripe and it is difficult to collect it that
is all with the exercise of a little care the nettle could be made
useful it is neglected and it becomes hurtful it is exterminated how
many men resemble the nettle he added after a pause remember this
my friends there are no such things as bad plants or bad men there are
the children loved him because he knew how to make charming little
when he saw the door of a church hung in black he entered he sought
out funerals as other men seek christenings widowhood and the grief of
others attracted him because of his great gentleness he mingled with
the friends clad in mourning with families dressed in black with
the priests groaning around a coffin he seemed to like to give to his
thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of
the other world with his eyes fixed on heaven he listened with a
sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite those sad
voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death
he performed a multitude of good actions concealing his agency in them
as a man conceals himself because of evil actions he penetrated houses
privately at night he ascended staircases furtively a poor wretch
on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened
sometimes even forced during his absence the poor man made a clamor
over it some malefactor had been there he entered and the first
thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of
furniture the malefactor who had been there was father madeleine
he was affable and sad the people said there is a rich man who has
not a haughty air there is a happy man who has not a contented air
some people maintained that he was a mysterious person and that no
one ever entered his chamber which was a regular anchorites cell
furnished with winged hour glasses and enlivened by cross bones and
skulls of dead men this was much talked of so that one of the elegant
and malicious young women of m sur m came to him one day and asked
monsieur le maire pray show us your chamber it is said to be a
grotto he smiled and introduced them instantly into this grotto
they were well punished for their curiosity the room was very simply
furnished in mahogany which was rather ugly like all furniture of
that sort and hung with paper worth twelve sous they could see nothing
remarkable about it except two candlesticks of antique pattern which
stood on the chimney piece and appeared to be silver for they were
hall marked an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns
nevertheless people continued to say that no one ever got into the
room and that it was a hermits cave a mysterious retreat a hole a
it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with
laffitte with this peculiar feature that they were always at his
immediate disposal so that it was added m madeleine could make his
appearance at laffittes any morning sign a receipt and carry off his
two or three millions in ten minutes in reality these two or three
millions were reducible as we have said to six hundred and thirty or
at the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of m
myriel bishop of d  surnamed monseigneur bienvenu who had died
in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty two
the bishop of d to supply here a detail which the papers
omitted had been blind for many years before his death and content to
be blind as his sister was beside him
let us remark by the way that to be blind and to be loved is in fact
one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth
where nothing is complete to have continually at ones side a woman a
daughter a sister a charming being who is there because you need her
and because she cannot do without you to know that we are indispensable
to a person who is necessary to us to be able to incessantly measure
ones affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us
and to say to ourselves since she consecrates the whole of her time
to me it is because i possess the whole of her heart to behold her
thought in lieu of her face to be able to verify the fidelity of one
being amid the eclipse of the world to regard the rustle of a gown
as the sound of wings to hear her come and go retire speak return
sing and to think that one is the centre of these steps of this
speech to manifest at each instant ones personal attraction to feel
ones self all the more powerful because of ones infirmity to become
in ones obscurity and through ones obscurity the star around which
this angel gravitates few felicities equal this the supreme happiness
of life consists in the conviction that one is loved loved for
ones own sake let us say rather loved in spite of ones self this
conviction the blind man possesses to be served in distress is to be
caressed does he lack anything no one does not lose the sight when
one has love and what love a love wholly constituted of virtue there
is no blindness where there is certainty soul seeks soul gropingly
and finds it and this soul found and tested is a woman a hand
sustains you it is hers a mouth lightly touches your brow it is her
mouth you hear a breath very near you it is hers to have everything
of her from her worship to her pity never to be left to have that
sweet weakness aiding you to lean upon that immovable reed to
touch providence with ones hands and to be able to take it in
ones arms god made tangible what bliss the heart that obscure
celestial flower undergoes a mysterious blossoming one would not
exchange that shadow for all brightness the angel soul is there
uninterruptedly there if she departs it is but to return again she
vanishes like a dream and reappears like reality one feels warmth
approaching and behold she is there one overflows with serenity with
gayety with ecstasy one is a radiance amid the night and there are
a thousand little cares nothings which are enormous in that void the
most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you and
supplying the vanished universe to you one is caressed with the soul
one sees nothing but one feels that one is adored it is a paradise of
it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the
the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m
sur m on the following day m madeleine appeared clad wholly in black
this mourning was noticed in the town and commented on it seemed
to throw a light on m madeleines origin it was concluded that some
relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop he has gone
into mourning for the bishop of d  said the drawing rooms this
raised m madeleines credit greatly and procured for him instantly
and at one blow a certain consideration in the noble world of m sur
m the microscopic faubourg saint germain of the place meditated raising
the quarantine against m madeleine the probable relative of a bishop
m madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained by the
more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles
of the young ones one evening a ruler in that petty great world who
was curious by right of seniority ventured to ask him m le maire is
doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d 
but resumed the dowager you are wearing mourning for him
he replied it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth
another thing which was remarked was that every time that he
encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the
country and seeking chimneys to sweep the mayor had him summoned
inquired his name and gave him money the little savoyards told each
other about it a great many of them passed that way
little by little and in the course of time all this opposition
subsided there had at first been exercised against m madeleine
in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to
blackening and calumnies then they grew to be nothing more than
ill nature then merely malicious remarks then even this entirely
disappeared respect became complete unanimous cordial and towards
1821 the moment arrived when the word monsieur le maire was pronounced
at m sur m with almost the same accent as monseigneur the bishop
had been pronounced in d in 1815 people came from a distance of ten
leagues around to consult m madeleine he put an end to differences
he prevented lawsuits he reconciled enemies every one took him for the
judge and with good reason it seemed as though he had for a soul the
book of the natural law it was like an epidemic of veneration which in
the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole
one single man in the town in the arrondissement absolutely escaped
this contagion and whatever father madeleine did remained his
opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct
kept him on the alert and uneasy it seems in fact as though there
existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct though pure and
upright like all instincts which creates antipathies and sympathies
which fatally separates one nature from another nature which does not
hesitate which feels no disquiet which does not hold its peace
and which never belies itself clear in its obscurity infallible
imperious intractable stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence
and to all the dissolvents of reason and which in whatever manner
destinies are arranged secretly warns the man dog of the presence of
the man cat and the man fox of the presence of the man lion
it frequently happened that when m madeleine was passing along a
street calm affectionate surrounded by the blessings of all a man of
lofty stature clad in an iron gray frock coat armed with a heavy
cane and wearing a battered hat turned round abruptly behind him and
followed him with his eyes until he disappeared with folded arms and
a slow shake of the head and his upper lip raised in company with
his lower to his nose a sort of significant grimace which might be
translated by what is that man after all i certainly have seen him
somewhere in any case i am not his dupe
this person grave with a gravity which was almost menacing was one
of those men who even when only seen by a rapid glimpse arrest the
his name was javert and he belonged to the police
at m sur m he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an
inspector he had not seen madeleines beginnings javert owed the post
which he occupied to the protection of m chabouillet the secretary of
the minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris
when javert arrived at m sur m the fortune of the great manufacturer
was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is
complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority
it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes we should
be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual
of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal
creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived
by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the
tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of them is in a man
sometimes even several of them at a time
animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices
straying before our eyes the visible phantoms of our souls god shows
them to us in order to induce us to reflect only since animals are mere
shadows god has not made them capable of education in the full sense
of the word what is the use on the contrary our souls being realities
and having a goal which is appropriate to them god has bestowed on
them intelligence that is to say the possibility of education social
education when well done can always draw from a soul of whatever sort
it may be the utility which it contains
this be it said is of course from the restricted point of view of the
terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound
question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are
not man the visible i in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the
latent i having made this reservation let us pass on
now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man
there is one of the animal species of creation it will be easy for us
to say what there was in police officer javert
the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves
there is one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as
he grew up he would devour the other little ones
give to this dog son of a wolf a human face and the result will be
javert had been born in prison of a fortune teller whose husband was
in the galleys as he grew up he thought that he was outside the pale
of society and he despaired of ever re entering it he observed that
society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men those who attack
it and those who guard it he had no choice except between these
two classes at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable
foundation of rigidity regularity and probity complicated with an
inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung he
entered the police he succeeded there at forty years of age he was an
during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of
before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the
words human face which we have just applied to javert
the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep
nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks one
felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns
for the first time when javert laughed and his laugh was rare and
terrible his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth
but his gums and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage
fold as on the muzzle of a wild beast javert serious was a watchdog
when he laughed he was a tiger as for the rest he had very little
skull and a great deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and
fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central
frown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth pursed
up and terrible his air that of ferocious command
this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments
comparatively but he rendered them almost bad by dint of exaggerating
them respect for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes
murder robbery all crimes are only forms of rebellion he enveloped
in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state
from the prime minister to the rural policeman he covered with scorn
aversion and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold
of evil he was absolute and admitted no exceptions on the one hand
he said the functionary can make no mistake the magistrate is never
the wrong on the other hand he said these men are irremediably
lost nothing good can come from them he fully shared the opinion of
those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power
of making or if the reader will have it so of authenticating demons
and who place a styx at the base of society he was stoical serious
austere a melancholy dreamer humble and haughty like fanatics his
glance was like a gimlet cold and piercing his whole life hung on
these two words watchfulness and supervision he had introduced a
straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world
he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his
functions and he was a spy as other men are priests woe to the man
who fell into his hands he would have arrested his own father if
the latter had escaped from the galleys and would have denounced his
mother if she had broken her ban and he would have done it with that
sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue and withal
a life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never
a diversion it was implacable duty the police understood as the
spartans understood sparta a pitiless lying in wait a ferocious
javerts whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who
withdraws himself from observation the mystical school of joseph de
maistre which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things
which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare
that javert was a symbol his brow was not visible it disappeared
beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since they were lost under
his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his
cravat his hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves
and his cane was not visible he carried it under his coat but when the
occasion presented itself there was suddenly seen to emerge from all
this shadow as from an ambuscade a narrow and angular forehead a
baleful glance a threatening chin enormous hands and a monstrous
in his leisure moments which were far from frequent he read although
he hated books this caused him to be not wholly illiterate this could
be recognized by some emphasis in his speech
as we have said he had no vices when he was pleased with himself
he permitted himself a pinch of snuff therein lay his connection with
the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that javert was the
terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry
of justice designates under the rubric vagrants the name of javert
routed them by its mere utterance the face of javert petrified them at
javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m madeleine an eye full of
suspicion and conjecture m madeleine had finally perceived the fact
but it seemed to be of no importance to him he did not even put a
question to javert he neither sought nor avoided him he bore that
embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it
he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the
it was divined from some words which escaped javert that he had
secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race
and into which there enters as much instinct as will all the anterior
traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere he seemed to
know and he sometimes said in covert words that some one had gleaned
certain information in a certain district about a family which had
disappeared once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself i
think i have him then he remained pensive for three days and uttered
not a word it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had
moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too
absolute sense which certain words might present there can be nothing
really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct
is that it can become confused thrown off the track and defeated
otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be
found to be provided with a better light than man
javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness
one day nevertheless his strange manner appeared to produce an
impression on m madeleine it was on the following occasion
one morning m madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m sur
m he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away he approached
an old man named father fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart
this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom m madeleine had at
that time when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood fauchelevent an
ex notary and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which
was beginning to be in a bad way fauchelevent had seen this simple
workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined this had filled
him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion
to injure madeleine then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had
nothing left but a cart and a horse and neither family nor children he
the horse had two broken legs and could not rise the old man was caught
in the wheels the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the
vehicle rested on his breast the cart was quite heavily laden father
fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner
they had tried but in vain to drag him out an unmethodical effort
aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him it was impossible to
disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him
javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a
help cried old fauchelevent who will be good and save the old man
is there a jack screw to be had
one has been sent for answered the peasant
how long will it take to get it
they have gone for the nearest to flachots place where there is a
farrier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an
it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked
the cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment and crushing
the old carters breast more and more it was evident that his ribs
it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to
but it will be too late then dont you see that the cart is sinking
listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart
to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back only half
a minute and the poor man can be taken out is there any one here who
has stout loins and heart there are five louis dor to be earned
the persons present dropped their eyes one of them muttered a man
would need to be devilish strong and then he runs the risk of getting
it is not the will which is lacking said a voice
m madeleine turned round and recognized javert he had not noticed him
it is strength one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing
as lift a cart like that on his back
then gazing fixedly at m madeleine he went on emphasizing every word
monsieur madeleine i have never known but one man capable of doing
javert added with an air of indifference but without removing his eyes
meanwhile the cart continued to sink slowly father fauchelevent
i am strangling my ribs are breaking a screw something ah
is there then no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the
i have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw and
ah it is crushing me cried the old man
madeleine raised his head met javerts falcon eye still fixed upon
him looked at the motionless peasants and smiled sadly then without
saying a word he fell on his knees and before the crowd had even had
time to utter a cry he was underneath the vehicle
a terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued
they beheld madeleine almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible
weight make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows
together they shouted to him father madeleine come out old
fauchelevent himself said to him monsieur madeleine go away you see
that i am fated to die leave me you will get yourself crushed also
all the spectators were panting the wheels had continued to sink and
it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under
suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver the cart rose slowly the
wheels half emerged from the ruts they heard a stifled voice crying
make haste help it was madeleine who had just made a final effort
they rushed forwards the devotion of a single man had given force and
courage to all the cart was raised by twenty arms old fauchelevent was
madeleine rose he was pale though dripping with perspiration his
clothes were torn and covered with mud all wept the old man kissed
his knees and called him the good god as for him he bore upon
his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial
suffering and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert who was still
chapter vii fauchelevent becomes a gardener in paris
fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall father madeleine
had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his
workmen in the factory building itself and which was served by two
sisters of charity on the following morning the old man found a
thousand franc bank note on his night stand with these words in father
madeleines writing i purchase your horse and cart the cart was
broken and the horse was dead fauchelevent recovered but his knee
remained stiff m madeleine on the recommendation of the sisters of
charity and of his priest got the good man a place as gardener in a
female convent in the rue saint antoine in paris
some time afterwards m madeleine was appointed mayor the first time
that javert beheld m madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him
authority over the town he felt the sort of shudder which a watch dog
might experience on smelling a wolf in his masters clothes from
that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could when the
requirements of the service imperatively demanded it and he could
not do otherwise than meet the mayor he addressed him with profound
this prosperity created at m sur m by father madeleine had besides
the visible signs which we have mentioned another symptom which was
none the less significant for not being visible this never deceives
when the population suffers when work is lacking when there is no
commerce the tax payer resists imposts through penury he exhausts and
oversteps his respite and the state expends a great deal of money in
the charges for compelling and collection when work is abundant when
the country is rich and happy the taxes are paid easily and cost the
state nothing it may be said that there is one infallible thermometer
of the public misery and riches the cost of collecting the taxes
in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had
diminished three fourths in the arrondissement of m sur m and this
led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by
such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither no
one remembered her fortunately the door of m madeleines factory was
like the face of a friend she presented herself there and was admitted
to the womens workroom the trade was entirely new to fantine she
could not be very skilful at it and she therefore earned but little by
her days work but it was sufficient the problem was solved she was
chapter viii madame victurnien expends thirty francs on morality
when fantine saw that she was making her living she felt joyful for a
moment to live honestly by her own labor what mercy from heaven the
taste for work had really returned to her she bought a looking glass
took pleasure in surveying in it her youth her beautiful hair her fine
teeth she forgot many things she thought only of cosette and of the
possible future and was almost happy she hired a little room and
furnished on credit on the strength of her future work a lingering
trace of her improvident ways as she was not able to say that she was
married she took good care as we have seen not to mention her little
at first as the reader has seen she paid the thenardiers promptly as
she only knew how to sign her name she was obliged to write through a
she wrote often and this was noticed it began to be said in an
undertone in the womens workroom that fantine wrote letters and
there is no one for spying on peoples actions like those who are
not concerned in them why does that gentleman never come except at
nightfall why does mr so and so never hang his key on its nail on
tuesday why does he always take the narrow streets why does madame
always descend from her hackney coach before reaching her house why
does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper when she has a
whole stationers shop full of it etc there exist beings who for
the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas which are moreover of
no consequence whatever to them spend more money waste more time
take more trouble than would be required for ten good actions and
that gratuitously for their own pleasure without receiving any other
payment for their curiosity than curiosity they will follow up such and
such a man or woman for whole days they will do sentry duty for hours
at a time on the corners of the streets under alley way doors at night
in cold and rain they will bribe errand porters they will make the
drivers of hackney coaches and lackeys tipsy buy a waiting maid suborn
a porter why for no reason a pure passion for seeing knowing
and penetrating into things a pure itch for talking and often
these secrets once known these mysteries made public these enigmas
illuminated by the light of day bring on catastrophies duels
failures the ruin of families and broken lives to the great joy
of those who have found out everything without any interest in the
matter and by pure instinct a sad thing
certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking
their conversation the chat of the drawing room gossip of the
anteroom is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly they need
a great amount of combustibles and their combustibles are furnished by
in addition many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white
it was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside in the
midst of the rest to wipe away a tear these were the moments when she
was thinking of her child perhaps also of the man whom she had loved
breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task
it was observed that she wrote twice a month at least and that she
paid the carriage on the letter they managed to obtain the address
monsieur monsieur thenardier inn keeper at montfermeil the public
writer a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine
without emptying his pocket of secrets was made to talk in the
wine shop in short it was discovered that fantine had a child she
must be a pretty sort of a woman an old gossip was found who made the
trip to montfermeil talked to the thenardiers and said on her return
for my five and thirty francs i have freed my mind i have seen the
the gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named madame victurnien the
guardian and door keeper of every ones virtue madame victurnien was
fifty six and re enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age
a quavering voice a whimsical mind this old dame had once been
young astonishing fact in her youth in 93 she had married a
monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap and passed from
the bernardines to the jacobins she was dry rough peevish sharp
captious almost venomous all this in memory of her monk whose widow
she was and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his
will she was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible
at the restoration she had turned bigot and that with so much energy
that the priests had forgiven her her monk she had a small property
which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community
she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras so this madame
victurnien went to montfermeil and returned with the remark i have
all this took time fantine had been at the factory for more than a
year when one morning the superintendent of the workroom handed her
fifty francs from the mayor told her that she was no longer employed
in the shop and requested her in the mayors name to leave the
this was the very month when the thenardiers after having demanded
twelve francs instead of six had just exacted fifteen francs instead of
fantine was overwhelmed she could not leave the neighborhood she was
in debt for her rent and furniture fifty francs was not sufficient
to cancel this debt she stammered a few supplicating words the
superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant besides
fantine was only a moderately good workwoman overcome with shame even
more than with despair she quitted the shop and returned to her room
so her fault was now known to every one
she no longer felt strong enough to say a word she was advised to
see the mayor she did not dare the mayor had given her fifty francs
because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just she
so the monks widow was good for something
but m madeleine had heard nothing of all this life is full of just
such combinations of events m madeleine was in the habit of almost
at the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster whom
the priest had provided for him and he had full confidence in this
superintendent a truly respectable person firm equitable upright
full of the charity which consists in giving but not having in the same
degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving
m madeleine relied wholly on her the best men are often obliged
to delegate their authority it was with this full power and the
conviction that she was doing right that the superintendent had
instituted the suit judged condemned and executed fantine
as regards the fifty francs she had given them from a fund which m
madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes and for giving
assistance to the workwomen and of which she rendered no account
fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood
she went from house to house no one would have her she could not
leave town the second hand dealer to whom she was in debt for her
furniture and what furniture said to her if you leave i will have
you arrested as a thief the householder whom she owed for her rent
said to her you are young and pretty you can pay she divided the
fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture dealer returned to
the latter three quarters of his goods kept only necessaries and found
herself without work without a trade with nothing but her bed and
she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison and earned
twelve sous a day her daughter cost her ten it was at this point that
however the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned
at night taught her the art of living in misery back of living on
little there is the living on nothing these are the two chambers the
fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter how to
give up a bird which eats a half a farthings worth of millet every
two days how to make a coverlet of ones petticoat and a petticoat of
ones coverlet how to save ones candle by taking ones meals by
the light of the opposite window no one knows all that certain feeble
creatures who have grown old in privation and honesty can get out of
a sou it ends by being a talent fantine acquired this sublime talent
at this epoch she said to a neighbor bah i say to myself by only
sleeping five hours and working all the rest of the time at my sewing
i shall always manage to nearly earn my bread and then when one is
sad one eats less well sufferings uneasiness a little bread on one
hand trouble on the other all this will support me
it would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in
this distress she thought of having her come but what then make her
share her own destitution and then she was in debt to the thenardiers
how could she pay them and the journey how pay for that
the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life
of indigence was a sainted spinster named marguerite who was pious
with a true piety poor and charitable towards the poor and even
towards the rich knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself
marguerite and believing in god which is science
there are many such virtuous people in this lower world some day they
will be in the world above this life has a morrow
at first fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out
when she was in the street she divined that people turned round behind
her and pointed at her every one stared at her and no one greeted her
the cold and bitter scorn of the passers by penetrated her very flesh
it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the
sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns in paris at least no
one knows you and this obscurity is a garment oh how she would have
she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute as she had accustomed
herself to indigence gradually she decided on her course at the
expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame and began to
go about as though there were nothing the matter it is all the same to
she went and came bearing her head well up with a bitter smile and
was conscious that she was becoming brazen faced
madame victurnien sometimes saw her passing from her window noticed
the distress of that creature who thanks to her had been put back
in her proper place and congratulated herself the happiness of the
excess of toil wore out fantine and the little dry cough which troubled
her increased she sometimes said to her neighbor marguerite just
nevertheless when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with
an old broken comb and it flowed about her like floss silk she
she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter the summer passed
but winter came again short days less work winter no warmth
no light no noonday the evening joining on to the morning fogs
twilight the window is gray it is impossible to see clearly at it the
sky is but a vent hole the whole day is a cavern the sun has the air
of a beggar a frightful season winter changes the water of heaven and
the heart of man into a stone her creditors harrassed her
fantine earned too little her debts had increased the thenardiers who
were not promptly paid wrote to her constantly letters whose contents
drove her to despair and whose carriage ruined her one day they wrote
to her that her little cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather
that she needed a woollen skirt and that her mother must send at least
ten francs for this she received the letter and crushed it in her
hands all day long that evening she went into a barbers shop at the
corner of the street and pulled out her comb her admirable golden hair
how much will you give me for it said she
she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardiers this
petticoat made the thenardiers furious it was the money that they
wanted they gave the petticoat to eponine the poor lark continued to
fantine thought my child is no longer cold i have clothed her with my
hair she put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head and
when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair she began to hate
every one about her she had long shared the universal veneration for
father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he
who had discharged her that he was the cause of her unhappiness she
came to hate him also and most of all when she passed the factory in
working hours when the workpeople were at the door she affected to
an old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion
said theres a girl who will come to a bad end
she took a lover the first who offered a man whom she did not love
out of bravado and with rage in her heart he was a miserable scamp
a sort of mendicant musician a lazy beggar who beat her and who
abandoned her as she had taken him in disgust
the lower she descended the darker everything grew about her the more
radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart she said
when i get rich i will have my cosette with me and she laughed her
cough did not leave her and she had sweats on her back
one day she received from the thenardiers a letter couched in the
following terms cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds
of the neighborhood a miliary fever they call it expensive drugs are
required this is ruining us and we can no longer pay for them if you
do not send us forty francs before the week is out the little one will
she burst out laughing and said to her old neighbor ah they are
good forty francs the idea that makes two napoleons where do they
think i am to get them these peasants are stupid truly
nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the
letter once more then she descended the stairs and emerged running and
some one met her and said to her what makes you so gay
she replied a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have
written to me they demand forty francs of me so much for you you
as she crossed the square she saw a great many people collected around
a carriage of eccentric shape upon the top of which stood a man dressed
in red who was holding forth he was a quack dentist on his rounds
who was offering to the public full sets of teeth opiates powders and
fantine mingled in the group and began to laugh with the rest at
the harangue which contained slang for the populace and jargon for
respectable people the tooth puller espied the lovely laughing girl
and suddenly exclaimed you have beautiful teeth you girl there who
are laughing if you want to sell me your palettes i will give you a
the palettes replied the dental professor are the front teeth the
two napoleons grumbled a toothless old woman who was present heres
fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse
voice of the man shouting to her reflect my beauty two napoleons
they may prove of service if your heart bids you come this evening to
the inn of the tillac dargent you will find me there
fantine returned home she was furious and related the occurrence to
her good neighbor marguerite can you understand such a thing is he
not an abominable man how can they allow such people to go about the
country pull out my two front teeth why i should be horrible my hair
will grow again but my teeth ah what a monster of a man i should
prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story
he told me that he should be at the tillac dargent this evening
she remained thoughtful and began her work at the expiration of a
quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the thenardiers
on her return she said to marguerite who was at work beside her
what is a miliary fever do you know
