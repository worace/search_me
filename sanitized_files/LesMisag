this is what floats up confusedly pell mell for the year 1817 and is
now forgotten history neglects nearly all these particulars and cannot
do otherwise the infinity would overwhelm it nevertheless these
details which are wrongly called trivial there are no trivial facts
in humanity nor little leaves in vegetation are useful it is of
the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is
composed in this year of 1817 four young parisians arranged a fine
these parisians came one from toulouse another from limoges the third
from cahors and the fourth from montauban but they were students and
when one says student one says parisian to study in paris is to be
these young men were insignificant every one has seen such faces four
specimens of humanity taken at random neither good nor bad neither
wise nor ignorant neither geniuses nor fools handsome with that
charming april which is called twenty years they were four oscars for
at that epoch arthurs did not yet exist burn for him the perfumes of
araby exclaimed romance oscar advances oscar i shall behold him
people had just emerged from ossian elegance was scandinavian and
caledonian the pure english style was only to prevail later and
the first of the arthurs wellington had but just won the battle of
these oscars bore the names one of felix tholomyes of toulouse the
second listolier of cahors the next fameuil of limoges the last
blachevelle of montauban naturally each of them had his mistress
blachevelle loved favourite so named because she had been in england
listolier adored dahlia who had taken for her nickname the name of a
flower fameuil idolized zephine an abridgment of josephine tholomyes
had fantine called the blonde because of her beautiful sunny hair
favourite dahlia zephine and fantine were four ravishing young women
perfumed and radiant still a little like working women and not yet
entirely divorced from their needles somewhat disturbed by intrigues
but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil
and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall
in woman one of the four was called the young because she was
the youngest of them and one was called the old the old one was
twenty three not to conceal anything the three first were more
experienced more heedless and more emancipated into the tumult of life
than fantine the blonde who was still in her first illusions
dahlia zephine and especially favourite could not have said as much
there had already been more than one episode in their romance though
hardly begun and the lover who had borne the name of adolph in the
first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second and gustave
in the third poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors one scolds
and the other flatters and the beautiful daughters of the people have
both of them whispering in their ear each on its own side these badly
guarded souls listen hence the falls which they accomplish and the
stones which are thrown at them they are overwhelmed with splendor of
all that is immaculate and inaccessible alas what if the jungfrau were
favourite having been in england was admired by dahlia and zephine she
had had an establishment of her own very early in life her father was
an old unmarried professor of mathematics a brutal man and a braggart
who went out to give lessons in spite of his age this professor when
he was a young man had one day seen a chambermaids gown catch on
a fender he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident the
result had been favourite she met her father from time to time and he
bowed to her one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee
had entered her apartments and had said to her you do not know me
mamemoiselle no i am your mother then the old woman opened the
sideboard and ate and drank had a mattress which she owned brought in
and installed herself this cross and pious old mother never spoke to
favourite remained hours without uttering a word breakfasted dined
and supped for four and went down to the porters quarters for company
it was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn dahlia to
listolier to others perhaps to idleness how could she make such nails
work she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands
as for zephine she had conquered fameuil by her roguish and caressing
the young men were comrades the young girls were friends such loves
goodness and philosophy are two distinct things the proof of this
is that after making all due allowances for these little irregular
households favourite zephine and dahlia were philosophical young
good some one will exclaim and tholomyes solomon would reply that
love forms a part of wisdom we will confine ourselves to saying that
the love of fantine was a first love a sole love a faithful love
she alone of all the four was not called thou by a single one of
fantine was one of those beings who blossom so to speak from the dregs
of the people though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths
of social shadow she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the
unknown she was born at m sur m of what parents who can say she had
never known father or mother she was called fantine why fantine she
had never borne any other name at the epoch of her birth the directory
still existed she had no family name she had no family no baptismal
name the church no longer existed she bore the name which pleased
the first random passer by who had encountered her when a very small
child running bare legged in the street she received the name as she
received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained she was
called little fantine no one knew more than that this human creature
had entered life in just this way at the age of ten fantine quitted
the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood at
fifteen she came to paris to seek her fortune fantine was beautiful
and remained pure as long as she could she was a lovely blonde with
fine teeth she had gold and pearls for her dowry but her gold was on
her head and her pearls were in her mouth
she worked for her living then still for the sake of her living for
the heart also has its hunger she loved
an amour for him passion for her the streets of the latin quarter
filled with throngs of students and grisettes saw the beginning of
their dream fantine had long evaded tholomyes in the mazes of the hill
of the pantheon where so many adventurers twine and untwine but in
such a way as constantly to encounter him again there is a way of
avoiding which resembles seeking in short the eclogue took place
blachevelle listolier and fameuil formed a sort of group of which
tholomyes was the head it was he who possessed the wit
tholomyes was the antique old student he was rich he had an income of
four thousand francs four thousand francs a splendid scandal on
mount sainte genevieve tholomyes was a fast man of thirty and badly
preserved he was wrinkled and toothless and he had the beginning of a
bald spot of which he himself said with sadness the skull at thirty
the knee at forty his digestion was mediocre and he had been attacked
by a watering in one eye but in proportion as his youth disappeared
gayety was kindled he replaced his teeth with buffooneries his hair
with mirth his health with irony his weeping eye laughed incessantly
he was dilapidated but still in flower his youth which was packing
up for departure long before its time beat a retreat in good order
bursting with laughter and no one saw anything but fire he had had a
piece rejected at the vaudeville he made a few verses now and then in
addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree which is a
vast force in the eyes of the weak being thus ironical and bald he
was the leader iron is an english word is it possible that irony is
one day tholomyes took the three others aside with the gesture of an
fantine dahlia zephine and favourite have been teasing us for nearly
a year to give them a surprise we have promised them solemnly that we
would they are forever talking about it to us to me in particular
just as the old women in naples cry to saint januarius faccia
gialluta fa o miracolo yellow face perform thy miracle so our
beauties say to me incessantly tholomyes when will you bring forth
your surprise at the same time our parents keep writing to us
pressure on both sides the moment has arrived it seems to me let us
thereupon tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so
mirthful that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four
mouths simultaneously and blachevelle exclaimed that is an idea
a smoky tap room presented itself they entered and the remainder of
the result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took
place on the following sunday the four young men inviting the four
it is hard nowadays to picture to ones self what a pleasure trip of
students and grisettes to the country was like forty five years ago
the suburbs of paris are no longer the same the physiognomy of what
may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last
half century where there was the cuckoo there is the railway car
where there was a tender boat there is now the steamboat people speak
of fecamp nowadays as they spoke of saint cloud in those days the paris
of 1862 is a city which has france for its outskirts
the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country
follies possible at that time the vacation was beginning and it was a
warm bright summer day on the preceding day favourite the only one
who knew how to write had written the following to tholomyes in the
name of the four it is a good hour to emerge from happiness that
is why they rose at five oclock in the morning then they went to
saint cloud by the coach looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed this
must be very beautiful when there is water they breakfasted at the
tete noir where castaing had not yet been they treated themselves to a
game of ring throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain
they ascended diogenes lantern they gambled for macaroons at the
roulette establishment of the pont de sevres picked bouquets at
pateaux bought reed pipes at neuilly ate apple tarts everywhere and
the young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their
cage it was a perfect delirium from time to time they bestowed little
taps on the young men matutinal intoxication of life adorable years
the wings of the dragonfly quiver oh whoever you may be do you not
remember have you rambled through the brushwood holding aside the
branches on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you
have you slid laughing down a slope all wet with rain with a beloved
woman holding your hand and crying ah my new boots what a state
let us say at once that that merry obstacle a shower was lacking in
the case of this good humored party although favourite had said as they
set out with a magisterial and maternal tone the slugs are crawling
in the paths a sign of rain children
all four were madly pretty a good old classic poet then famous a good
fellow who had an eleonore m le chevalier de labouisse as he strolled
that day beneath the chestnut trees of saint cloud saw them pass about
ten oclock in the morning and exclaimed there is one too many of
them as he thought of the graces favourite blachevelles friend the
one aged three and twenty the old one ran on in front under the great
green boughs jumped the ditches stalked distractedly over bushes and
presided over this merry making with the spirit of a young female faun
zephine and dahlia whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that
they set each off when they were together and completed each other
never left each other more from an instinct of coquetry than from
friendship and clinging to each other they assumed english poses the
first keepsakes had just made their appearance melancholy was dawning
for women as later on byronism dawned for men and the hair of the
tender sex began to droop dolefully zephine and dahlia had their hair
dressed in rolls listolier and fameuil who were engaged in discussing
their professors explained to fantine the difference that existed
blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry favourites
single bordered imitation india shawl of ternauxs manufacture on his
tholomyes followed dominating the group he was very gay but one felt
the force of government in him there was dictation in his joviality
his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant leg pattern of
nankeen with straps of braided copper wire he carried a stout rattan
worth two hundred francs in his hand and as he treated himself to
everything a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth nothing was
that tholomyes is astounding said the others with veneration what
as for fantine she was a joy to behold her splendid teeth had
evidently received an office from god laughter she preferred to carry
her little hat of sewed straw with its long white strings in her hand
rather than on her head her thick blond hair which was inclined to
wave and which easily uncoiled and which it was necessary to fasten
up incessantly seemed made for the flight of galatea under the
willows her rosy lips babbled enchantingly the corners of her mouth
voluptuously turned up as in the antique masks of erigone had an
air of encouraging the audacious but her long shadowy lashes drooped
discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to
call a halt there was something indescribably harmonious and striking
about her entire dress she wore a gown of mauve barege little reddish
brown buskins whose ribbons traced an x on her fine white open worked
stockings and that sort of muslin spencer a marseilles invention
whose name canezou a corruption of the words quinze aout pronounced
after the fashion of the canebiere signifies fine weather heat and
midday the three others less timid as we have already said
wore low necked dresses without disguise which in summer beneath
flower adorned hats are very graceful and enticing but by the side
of these audacious outfits blond fantines canezou with its
transparencies its indiscretion and its reticence concealing and
displaying at one and the same time seemed an alluring godsend of
decency and the famous court of love presided over by the vicomtesse
de cette with the sea green eyes would perhaps have awarded the
prize for coquetry to this canezou in the contest for the prize of
modesty the most ingenious is at times the wisest this does happen
brilliant of face delicate of profile with eyes of a deep blue heavy
lids feet arched and small wrists and ankles admirably formed a white
skin which here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to
be seen joy a cheek that was young and fresh the robust throat of the
juno of aegina a strong and supple nape of the neck shoulders modelled
as though by coustou with a voluptuous dimple in the middle visible
through the muslin a gayety cooled by dreaminess sculptural and
exquisite such was fantine and beneath these feminine adornments and
these ribbons one could divine a statue and in that statue a soul
fantine was beautiful without being too conscious of it those rare
dreamers mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront
everything with perfection would have caught a glimpse in this little
working woman through the transparency of her parisian grace of the
ancient sacred euphony this daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred
she was beautiful in the two ways style and rhythm style is the form
we have said that fantine was joy she was also modesty
to an observer who studied her attentively that which breathed from
her athwart all the intoxication of her age the season and her
love affair was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty she
remained a little astonished this chaste astonishment is the shade
of difference which separates psyche from venus fantine had the long
white fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the
sacred fire with a golden pin although she would have refused nothing
to tholomyes as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see her
face in repose was supremely virginal a sort of serious and almost
austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times and there
was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so
suddenly extinct there and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without
any transition state this sudden and sometimes severely accentuated
gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess her brow her nose her
chin presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct
from equilibrium of proportion and from which harmony of countenance
results in the very characteristic interval which separates the base
of the nose from the upper lip she had that imperceptible and charming
fold a mysterious sign of chastity which makes barberousse fall in
love with a diana found in the treasures of iconia
love is a fault so be it fantine was innocence floating high over
chapter iv tholomyes is so merry that he sings a spanish ditty
that day was composed of dawn from one end to the other all nature
seemed to be having a holiday and to be laughing the flower beds of
saint cloud perfumed the air the breath of the seine rustled the
leaves vaguely the branches gesticulated in the wind bees pillaged the
jasmines a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow
the clover and the sterile oats in the august park of the king of
france there was a pack of vagabonds the birds
the four merry couples mingled with the sun the fields the flowers
and in this community of paradise talking singing running dancing
chasing butterflies plucking convolvulus wetting their pink open work
stockings in the tall grass fresh wild without malice all received
to some extent the kisses of all with the exception of fantine
who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of
dreaminess and wildness and who was in love you always have a queer
such things are joys these passages of happy couples are a profound
appeal to life and nature and make a caress and light spring forth from
everything there was once a fairy who created the fields and forests
expressly for those in love in that eternal hedge school of lovers
which is forever beginning anew and which will last as long as there
are hedges and scholars hence the popularity of spring among thinkers
the patrician and the knife grinder the duke and the peer the limb
of the law the courtiers and townspeople as they used to say in olden
times all are subjects of this fairy they laugh and hunt and there
is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis what a transfiguration
effected by love notaries clerks are gods and the little cries
the pursuits through the grass the waists embraced on the fly those
jargons which are melodies those adorations which burst forth in the
manner of pronouncing a syllable those cherries torn from one mouth by
another all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial
glories beautiful women waste themselves sweetly they think that this
will never come to an end philosophers poets painters observe these
ecstasies and know not what to make of it so greatly are they dazzled
by it the departure for cythera exclaims watteau lancret the painter
of plebeians contemplates his bourgeois who have flitted away into the
azure sky diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls and
after breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the kings
square to see a newly arrived plant from india whose name escapes our
memory at this moment and which at that epoch was attracting all
paris to saint cloud it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem
whose numerous branches bristling and leafless and as fine as threads
were covered with a million tiny white rosettes this gave the shrub the
air of a head of hair studded with flowers there was always an admiring
after viewing the shrub tholomyes exclaimed i offer you asses and
having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses they returned
by way of vanvres and issy at issy an incident occurred the truly
national park at that time owned by bourguin the contractor happened
to be wide open they passed the gates visited the manikin anchorite in
his grotto tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet
of mirrors the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of
turcaret metamorphosed into a priapus they had stoutly shaken the swing
attached to the two chestnut trees celebrated by the abbe de bernis
as he swung these beauties one after the other producing folds in the
fluttering skirts which greuze would have found to his taste amid peals
of laughter the toulousan tholomyes who was somewhat of a spaniard
toulouse being the cousin of tolosa sang to a melancholy chant the
old ballad gallega probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in
full flight upon a rope between two trees
amor me llama and love is my name
toda mi alma to my eyes in flame
es en mi ojos all my soul doth come
a tuas piernas i receive at thy feet
i dont like to have people put on airs like that muttered favourite
after leaving the asses there was a fresh delight they crossed the
seine in a boat and proceeding from passy on foot they reached the
barrier of letoile they had been up since five oclock that morning
as the reader will remember but bah there is no such thing as fatigue
on sunday said favourite on sunday fatigue does not work
about three oclock the four couples frightened at their happiness
were sliding down the russian mountains a singular edifice which then
occupied the heights of beaujon and whose undulating line was visible
the russian mountains having been exhausted they began to think about
dinner and the radiant party of eight somewhat weary at last became
stranded in bombardas public house a branch establishment which had
been set up in the champs elysees by that famous restaurant keeper
bombarda whose sign could then be seen in the rue de rivoli near
a large but ugly room with an alcove and a bed at the end they had
been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the sunday
crowd two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms the quay
and the river a magnificent august sunlight lightly touching the panes
two tables upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets mingled
with the hats of men and women at the other the four couples seated
round a merry confusion of platters dishes glasses and bottles jugs
of beer mingled with flasks of wine very little order on the table
a noise a clatter of the feet that was abominable
this was the state which the shepherd idyl begun at five oclock in
the morning had reached at half past four in the afternoon the sun was
the champs elysees filled with sunshine and with people were nothing
but light and dust the two things of which glory is composed the
horses of marly those neighing marbles were prancing in a cloud
of gold carriages were going and coming a squadron of magnificent
body guards with their clarions at their head were descending the
avenue de neuilly the white flag showing faintly rosy in the setting
sun floated over the dome of the tuileries the place de la concorde
which had become the place louis xv once more was choked with happy
promenaders many wore the silver fleur de lys suspended from the
white watered ribbon which had not yet wholly disappeared from
button holes in the year 1817 here and there choruses of little girls
threw to the winds amid the passersby who formed into circles and
applauded the then celebrated bourbon air which was destined to strike
the hundred days with lightning and which had for its refrain
groups of dwellers in the suburbs in sunday array sometimes even
decorated with the fleur de lys like the bourgeois scattered over the
large square and the marigny square were playing at rings and revolving
on the wooden horses others were engaged in drinking some journeyman
printers had on paper caps their laughter was audible every thing
was radiant it was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist
security it was the epoch when a special and private report of chief
of police angeles to the king on the subject of the suburbs of paris
taking all things into consideration sire there is nothing to be
feared from these people they are as heedless and as indolent as cats
the populace is restless in the provinces it is not in paris these are
very pretty men sire it would take all of two of them to make one
of your grenadiers there is nothing to be feared on the part of the
populace of paris the capital it is remarkable that the stature of
this population should have diminished in the last fifty years and
the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the
revolution it is not dangerous in short it is an amiable rabble
prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform
itself into a lion that does happen however and in that lies the
miracle wrought by the populace of paris moreover the cat so despised
by count angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old in their
eyes it was liberty incarnate and as though to serve as pendant to
the minerva aptera of the piraeus there stood on the public square in
corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat the ingenuous police of the
restoration beheld the populace of paris in too rose colored a light
it is not so much of an amiable rabble as it is thought the parisian
is to the frenchman what the athenian was to the greek no one sleeps
more soundly than he no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than
he no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness let him not be
trusted nevertheless he is ready for any sort of cool deed but when
there is glory at the end of it he is worthy of admiration in every
sort of fury give him a pike he will produce the 10th of august give
him a gun you will have austerlitz he is napoleons stay and dantons
resource is it a question of country he enlists is it a question of
liberty he tears up the pavements beware his hair filled with wrath
is epic his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys take
care he will make of the first rue grenetat which comes to hand caudine
forks when the hour strikes this man of the faubourgs will grow in
stature this little man will arise and his gaze will be terrible and
his breath will become a tempest and there will issue forth from that
slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the alps it is
thanks to the suburban man of paris that the revolution mixed with
arms conquers europe he sings it is his delight proportion his song
to his nature and you will see as long as he has for refrain nothing
but la carmagnole he only overthrows louis xvi make him sing the
this note jotted down on the margin of angles report we will return to
our four couples the dinner as we have said was drawing to its close
chapter vi a chapter in which they adore each other
chat at table the chat of love it is as impossible to reproduce one as
the other the chat of love is a cloud the chat at table is smoke
fameuil and dahlia were humming tholomyes was drinking zephine was
laughing fantine smiling listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he
what would you do favourite if i were to cease to love you
i cried favourite ah do not say that even in jest if you were
to cease to love me i would spring after you i would scratch you
i should rend you i would throw you into the water i would have you
blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self conceit of a man who is
yes i would scream to the police ah i should not restrain myself
blachevelle threw himself back in his chair in an ecstasy and closed
dahlia as she ate said in a low voice to favourite amid the uproar
so you really idolize him deeply that blachevelle of yours
i i detest him replied favourite in the same tone seizing her fork
again he is avaricious i love the little fellow opposite me in my
house he is very nice that young man do you know him one can see
that he is an actor by profession i love actors as soon as he comes
in his mother says to him ah mon dieu my peace of mind is gone
there he goes with his shouting but my dear you are splitting my
head so he goes up to rat ridden garrets to black holes as high as
he can mount and there he sets to singing declaiming how do i know
what so that he can be heard down stairs he earns twenty sous a day at
an attorneys by penning quibbles he is the son of a former precentor
of saint jacques du haut pas ah he is very nice he idolizes me so
that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes he said to
me mamselle make your gloves into fritters and i will eat them it
is only artists who can say such things as that ah he is very nice
i am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow never
mind i tell blachevelle that i adore him how i lie hey how i do
i am sad you see dahlia it has done nothing but rain all summer the
wind irritates me the wind does not abate blachevelle is very stingy
there are hardly any green peas in the market one does not know what to
eat i have the spleen as the english say butter is so dear and then
you see it is horrible here we are dining in a room with a bed in it
in the meantime while some sang the rest talked together tumultuously
all at once it was no longer anything but noise tholomyes intervened
let us not talk at random nor too fast he exclaimed let us reflect
if we wish to be brilliant too much improvisation empties the mind in
a stupid way running beer gathers no froth no haste gentlemen let us
mingle majesty with the feast let us eat with meditation let us make
haste slowly let us not hurry consider the springtime if it makes
haste it is done for that is to say it gets frozen excess of zeal
ruins peach trees and apricot trees excess of zeal kills the grace and
the mirth of good dinners no zeal gentlemen grimod de la reyniere
a hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group
you are the marquis of that retorted tholomyes
this mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool
the marquis de montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist all the
friends cried tholomyes with the accent of a man who had recovered
his empire come to yourselves this pun which has fallen from the
skies must not be received with too much stupor everything which falls
in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect the pun
is the dung of the mind which soars the jest falls no matter where
and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure
depths a whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the
condor from soaring aloft far be it from me to insult the pun i honor
it in proportion to its merits nothing more all the most august the
most sublime the most charming of humanity and perhaps outside of
humanity have made puns jesus christ made a pun on st peter moses on
isaac aeschylus on polynices cleopatra on octavius and observe that
cleopatras pun preceded the battle of actium and that had it not been
for it no one would have remembered the city of toryne a greek name
which signifies a ladle that once conceded i return to my exhortation
i repeat brothers i repeat no zeal no hubbub no excess even in
witticisms gayety jollities or plays on words listen to me i have
the prudence of amphiaraus and the baldness of caesar there must be a
limit even to rebuses est modus in rebus
there must be a limit even to dinners you are fond of apple
turnovers ladies do not indulge in them to excess even in the matter
of turnovers good sense and art are requisite gluttony chastises the
glutton gula punit gulax indigestion is charged by the good god with
preaching morality to stomachs and remember this each one of our
passions even love has a stomach which must not be filled too full in
all things the word finis must be written in good season self control
must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent the bolt must be drawn
on appetite one must set ones own fantasy to the violin and carry
ones self to the post the sage is the man who knows how at a given
moment to effect his own arrest have some confidence in me for i
have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law according to
the verdict of my examinations for i know the difference between the
question put and the question pending for i have sustained a thesis in
latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at rome at the
epoch when munatius demens was quaestor of the parricide because i
am going to be a doctor apparently it does not follow that it is
absolutely necessary that i should be an imbecile i recommend you to
moderation in your desires it is true that my name is felix tholomyes
i speak well happy is he who when the hour strikes takes a heroic
felix said she what a pretty word i love that name it is latin
quirites gentlemen caballeros my friends do you wish never to feel
the prick to do without the nuptial bed and to brave love nothing
more simple here is the receipt lemonade excessive exercise hard
labor work yourself to death drag blocks sleep not hold vigil
gorge yourself with nitrous beverages and potions of nymphaeas drink
emulsions of poppies and agnus castus season this with a strict diet
starve yourself and add thereto cold baths girdles of herbs the
application of a plate of lead lotions made with the subacetate of
woman resumed tholomyes distrust her woe to him who yields himself
to the unstable heart of woman woman is perfidious and disingenuous
she detests the serpent from professional jealousy the serpent is the
glory to wine nunc te bacche canam pardon me ladies that is
spanish and the proof of it senoras is this like people like cask
the arrobe of castile contains sixteen litres the cantaro of alicante
twelve the almude of the canaries twenty five the cuartin of the
balearic isles twenty six the boot of tzar peter thirty long
live that tzar who was great and long live his boot which was still
greater ladies take the advice of a friend make a mistake in your
neighbor if you see fit the property of love is to err a love
affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an english
serving maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing it is not
made for that it errs gayly our gentle love it has been said error
is human i say error is love ladies i idolize you all o zephine o
josephine face more than irregular you would be charming were you not
all askew you have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has
sat down by mistake as for favourite o nymphs and muses one day
when blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue guerin boisseau
he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up which
displayed her legs this prologue pleased him and blachevelle fell
in love the one he loved was favourite o favourite thou hast ionian
lips there was a greek painter named euphorion who was surnamed the
painter of the lips that greek alone would have been worthy to paint
thy mouth listen before thee there was never a creature worthy of the
name thou wert made to receive the apple like venus or to eat it like
eve beauty begins with thee i have just referred to eve it is thou
who hast created her thou deservest the letters patent of the beautiful
woman o favourite i cease to address you as thou because i pass
from poetry to prose you were speaking of my name a little while ago
that touched me but let us whoever we may be distrust names they may
delude us i am called felix and i am not happy words are liars let
us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us it would be
a mistake to write to liege 2 for corks and to pau for gloves miss
dahlia were i in your place i would call myself rosa a flower should
smell sweet and woman should have wit i say nothing of fantine she
is a dreamer a musing thoughtful pensive person she is a phantom
possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun who has
strayed into the life of a grisette but who takes refuge in illusions
and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well
knowing what she sees or what she is doing and who with her eyes fixed
on heaven wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in
existence o fantine know this i tholomyes i am all illusion but
she does not even hear me that blond maid of chimeras as for the rest
everything about her is freshness suavity youth sweet morning light
o fantine maid worthy of being called marguerite or pearl you are a
woman from the beauteous orient ladies a second piece of advice do
not marry marriage is a graft it takes well or ill avoid that risk
but bah what am i saying i am wasting my words girls are incurable
on the subject of marriage and all that we wise men can say will not
prevent the waistcoat makers and the shoe stitchers from dreaming
of husbands studded with diamonds well so be it but my beauties
remember this you eat too much sugar you have but one fault o woman
and that is nibbling sugar o nibbling sex your pretty little white
teeth adore sugar now heed me well sugar is a salt all salts are
withering sugar is the most desiccating of all salts it sucks the
liquids of the blood through the veins hence the coagulation and then
the solidification of the blood hence tubercles in the lungs hence
death that is why diabetes borders on consumption then do not crunch
sugar and you will live i turn to the men gentlemen make conquest
rob each other of your well beloved without remorse chassez across
in love there are no friends everywhere where there is a pretty woman
hostility is open no quarter war to the death a pretty woman is a
casus belli a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor all the invasions
of history have been determined by petticoats woman is mans right
romulus carried off the sabines william carried off the saxon women
caesar carried off the roman women the man who is not loved soars like
a vulture over the mistresses of other men and for my own part to all
those unfortunate men who are widowers i throw the sublime proclamation
of bonaparte to the army of italy soldiers you are in need of
at the same moment blachevelle supported by listolier and fameuil
struck up to a plaintive air one of those studio songs composed of
the first words which come to hand rhymed richly and not at all as
destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind
which have their birth in the vapor of pipes and are dissipated and
take their flight with them this is the couplet by which the group
might be made pope on saint johns day fair
this was not calculated to calm tholomyes improvisation he emptied his
down with wisdom forget all that i have said let us be neither prudes
nor prudent men nor prudhommes i propose a toast to mirth be merry
let us complete our course of law by folly and eating indigestion and
the digest let justinian be the male and feasting the female joy in
the depths live o creation the world is a great diamond i am happy
the birds are astonishing what a festival everywhere the nightingale
is a gratuitous elleviou summer i salute thee o luxembourg o
georgics of the rue madame and of the allee de lobservatoire o
pensive infantry soldiers o all those charming nurses who while they
guard the children amuse themselves the pampas of america would please
me if i had not the arcades of the odeon my soul flits away into the
virgin forests and to the savannas all is beautiful the flies buzz in
the sun the sun has sneezed out the humming bird embrace me fantine
the dinners are better at edons than at bombardas exclaimed
i prefer bombarda to edon declared blachevelle there is more
luxury it is more asiatic look at the room downstairs there are
i prefer them glaces ices on my plate said favourite
look at the knives the handles are of silver at bombardas and of bone
at edons now silver is more valuable than bone
except for those who have a silver chin observed tholomyes
he was looking at the dome of the invalides which was visible from
tholomyes exclaimed fameuil listolier and i were having a
a discussion is a good thing replied tholomyes a quarrel is
this decree pronounced he took a drink and went on
i consent to live all is not at an end on earth since we can still
talk nonsense for that i return thanks to the immortal gods we lie
one lies but one laughs one affirms but one doubts the unexpected
bursts forth from the syllogism that is fine there are still human
beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the
paradox merrily this ladies which you are drinking with so tranquil
an air is madeira wine you must know from the vineyard of coural das
freiras which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of
the sea attention while you drink three hundred and seventeen fathoms
and monsieur bombarda the magnificent eating house keeper gives you
those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty
tholomyes your opinions fix the law who is your favorite author
honor to bombarda he would equal munophis of elephanta if he could but
get me an indian dancing girl and thygelion of chaeronea if he could
bring me a greek courtesan for oh ladies there were bombardas in
greece and in egypt apuleius tells us of them alas always the same
and nothing new nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation
nil sub sole novum says solomon amor omnibus idem says virgil and
carabine mounts with carabin into the bark at saint cloud as aspasia
embarked with pericles upon the fleet at samos one last word do you
know what aspasia was ladies although she lived at an epoch when women
had as yet no soul she was a soul a soul of a rosy and purple
hue more ardent hued than fire fresher than the dawn aspasia was
a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met she was the goddess
prostitute socrates plus manon lescaut aspasia was created in case a
tholomyes once started would have found some difficulty in stopping
had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment the
shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt it was a
beauceron mare old and thin and one fit for the knacker which was
dragging a very heavy cart on arriving in front of bombardas the
