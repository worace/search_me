promises to furnish the freedmen with land its successes were the
result of hard work supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the
eager striving of black men its failures were the result of bad local
agents the inherent difficulties of the work and national neglect
such an institution from its wide powers great responsibilities
large control of moneys and generally conspicuous position was
naturally open to repeated and bitter attack it sustained a searching
congressional investigation at the instance of fernando wood in 1870
its archives and few remaining functions were with blunt discourtesy
transferred from howards control in his absence to the supervision
of secretary of war belknap in 1872 on the secretarys recommendation
finally in consequence of grave intimations of wrong doing made by the
secretary and his subordinates general howard was court martialed in
1874 in both of these trials the commissioner of the freedmens
bureau was officially exonerated from any wilful misdoing and his work
commended nevertheless many unpleasant things were brought to
light the methods of transacting the business of the bureau were
faulty several cases of defalcation were proved and other frauds
strongly suspected there were some business transactions which savored
of dangerous speculation if not dishonesty and around it all lay the
morally and practically the freedmens bank was part of the freedmens
bureau although it had no legal connection with it with the prestige
of the government back of it and a directing board of unusual
respectability and national reputation this banking institution had
made a remarkable start in the development of that thrift among black
folk which slavery had kept them from knowing then in one sad day
came the crash all the hard earned dollars of the freedmen
disappeared but that was the least of the loss all the faith in
saving went too and much of the faith in men and that was a loss that
a nation which to day sneers at negro shiftlessness has never yet made
good not even ten additional years of slavery could have done so much
to throttle the thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and
bankruptcy of the series of savings banks chartered by the nation for
their especial aid where all the blame should rest it is hard to
say whether the bureau and the bank died chiefly by reason of the
blows of its selfish friends or the dark machinations of its foes
perhaps even time will never reveal for here lies unwritten history
of the foes without the bureau the bitterest were those who attacked
not so much its conduct or policy under the law as the necessity for
any such institution at all such attacks came primarily from the
border states and the south and they were summed up by senator davis
of kentucky when he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill to
promote strife and conflict between the white and black races    by
a grant of unconstitutional power the argument gathered tremendous
strength south and north but its very strength was its weakness for
argued the plain common sense of the nation if it is unconstitutional
unpractical and futile for the nation to stand guardian over its
helpless wards then there is left but one alternative to make those
wards their own guardians by arming them with the ballot moreover
the path of the practical politician pointed the same way for argued
this opportunist if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the south with
white votes we certainly can with black votes so justice and force
the alternative thus offered the nation was not between full and
restricted negro suffrage else every sensible man black and white
would easily have chosen the latter it was rather a choice between
suffrage and slavery after endless blood and gold had flowed to sweep
human bondage away not a single southern legislature stood ready to
admit a negro under any conditions to the polls not a single
southern legislature believed free negro labor was possible without a
system of restrictions that took all its freedom away there was
scarcely a white man in the south who did not honestly regard
emancipation as a crime and its practical nullification as a duty in
such a situation the granting of the ballot to the black man was a
necessity the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race
and the only method of compelling the south to accept the results of
the war thus negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race
feud and some felt gratitude toward the race thus sacrificed in its
swaddling clothes on the altar of national integrity and some felt and
had political exigencies been less pressing the opposition to
government guardianship of negroes less bitter and the attachment to
the slave system less strong the social seer can well imagine a far
better policy a permanent freedmens bureau with a national system
of negro schools a carefully supervised employment and labor office a
system of impartial protection before the regular courts and such
institutions for social betterment as savings banks land and building
associations and social settlements all this vast expenditure of
money and brains might have formed a great school of prospective
citizenship and solved in a way we have not yet solved the most
that such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to
certain acts of the freedmens bureau itself it came to regard its
work as merely temporary and negro suffrage as a final answer to all
present perplexities the political ambition of many of its agents and
proteges led it far afield into questionable activities until the
south nursing its own deep prejudices came easily to ignore all the
good deeds of the bureau and hate its very name with perfect hatred
so the freedmens bureau died and its child was the fifteenth
the passing of a great human institution before its work is done like
the untimely passing of a single soul but leaves a legacy of striving
for other men the legacy of the freedmens bureau is the heavy
heritage of this generation to day when new and vaster problems are
destined to strain every fibre of the national mind and soul would it
not be well to count this legacy honestly and carefully for this much
all men know despite compromise war and struggle the negro is not
free in the backwoods of the gulf states for miles and miles he may
not leave the plantation of his birth in well nigh the whole rural
south the black farmers are peons bound by law and custom to an
economic slavery from which the only escape is death or the
penitentiary in the most cultured sections and cities of the south
the negroes are a segregated servile caste with restricted rights and
privileges before the courts both in law and custom they stand on a
different and peculiar basis taxation without representation is the
rule of their political life and the result of all this is and in
nature must have been lawlessness and crime that is the large legacy
of the freedmens bureau the work it did not do because it could not
i have seen a land right merry with the sun where children sing and
rolling hills lie like passioned women wanton with harvest and there
in the kings highways sat and sits a figure veiled and bowed by which
the travellers footsteps hasten as they go on the tainted air broods
fear three centuries thought has been the raising and unveiling of
that bowed human heart and now behold a century new for the duty and
the deed the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the
from birth till death enslaved in word in deed unmanned
who would be free themselves must strike the blow
easily the most striking thing in the history of the american negro
since 1876 is the ascendancy of mr booker t washington it began at
the time when war memories and ideals were rapidly passing a day of
astonishing commercial development was dawning a sense of doubt and
hesitation overtook the freedmens sons then it was that his leading
began mr washington came with a simple definite programme at the
psychological moment when the nation was a little ashamed of having
bestowed so much sentiment on negroes and was concentrating its
energies on dollars his programme of industrial education
conciliation of the south and submission and silence as to civil and
political rights was not wholly original the free negroes from 1830
up to war time had striven to build industrial schools and the
american missionary association had from the first taught various
trades and price and others had sought a way of honorable alliance
with the best of the southerners but mr washington first
indissolubly linked these things he put enthusiasm unlimited energy
and perfect faith into his programme and changed it from a by path
into a veritable way of life and the tale of the methods by which he
did this is a fascinating study of human life
it startled the nation to hear a negro advocating such a programme
after many decades of bitter complaint it startled and won the
applause of the south it interested and won the admiration of the
north and after a confused murmur of protest it silenced if it did
to gain the sympathy and cooperation of the various elements comprising
the white south was mr washingtons first task and this at the time
tuskegee was founded seemed for a black man well nigh impossible
and yet ten years later it was done in the word spoken at atlanta in
all things purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers and
yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress this
atlanta compromise is by all odds the most notable thing in mr
washingtons career the south interpreted it in different ways the
radicals received it as a complete surrender of the demand for civil
and political equality the conservatives as a generously conceived
working basis for mutual understanding so both approved it and
to day its author is certainly the most distinguished southerner since
jefferson davis and the one with the largest personal following
next to this achievement comes mr washingtons work in gaining place
and consideration in the north others less shrewd and tactful had
formerly essayed to sit on these two stools and had fallen between
them but as mr washington knew the heart of the south from birth and
training so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of
the age which was dominating the north and so thoroughly did he learn
the speech and thought of triumphant commercialism and the ideals of
material prosperity that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a
french grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected home soon seemed
to him the acme of absurdities one wonders what socrates and st
and yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his
age is a mark of the successful man it is as though nature must needs
make men narrow in order to give them force so mr washingtons cult
has gained unquestioning followers his work has wonderfully prospered
his friends are legion and his enemies are confounded to day he
stands as the one recognized spokesman of his ten million fellows and
one of the most notable figures in a nation of seventy millions one
hesitates therefore to criticise a life which beginning with so
little has done so much and yet the time is come when one may speak
in all sincerity and utter courtesy of the mistakes and shortcomings of
mr washingtons career as well as of his triumphs without being
thought captious or envious and without forgetting that it is easier
to do ill than well in the world
the criticism that has hitherto met mr washington has not always been
of this broad character in the south especially has he had to walk
warily to avoid the harshest judgments and naturally so for he is
dealing with the one subject of deepest sensitiveness to that section
twice once when at the chicago celebration of the spanish american war
he alluded to the color prejudice that is eating away the vitals of
the south and once when he dined with president roosevelt has the
resulting southern criticism been violent enough to threaten seriously
his popularity in the north the feeling has several times forced
itself into words that mr washingtons counsels of submission
overlooked certain elements of true manhood and that his educational
programme was unnecessarily narrow usually however such criticism
has not found open expression although too the spiritual sons of the
abolitionists have not been prepared to acknowledge that the schools
founded before tuskegee by men of broad ideals and self sacrificing
spirit were wholly failures or worthy of ridicule while then
criticism has not failed to follow mr washington yet the prevailing
public opinion of the land has been but too willing to deliver the
solution of a wearisome problem into his hands and say if that is
all you and your race ask take it
among his own people however mr washington has encountered the
strongest and most lasting opposition amounting at times to
bitterness and even today continuing strong and insistent even though
largely silenced in outward expression by the public opinion of the
nation some of this opposition is of course mere envy the
disappointment of displaced demagogues and the spite of narrow minds
but aside from this there is among educated and thoughtful colored men
in all parts of the land a feeling of deep regret sorrow and
apprehension at the wide currency and ascendancy which some of mr
washingtons theories have gained these same men admire his sincerity
of purpose and are willing to forgive much to honest endeavor which is
doing something worth the doing they cooperate with mr washington as
far as they conscientiously can and indeed it is no ordinary tribute
to this mans tact and power that steering as he must between so many
diverse interests and opinions he so largely retains the respect of
but the hushing of the criticism of honest opponents is a dangerous
thing it leads some of the best of the critics to unfortunate silence
and paralysis of effort and others to burst into speech so
passionately and intemperately as to lose listeners honest and
earnest criticism from those whose interests are most nearly
touched criticism of writers by readers this is the soul of
democracy and the safeguard of modern society if the best of the
american negroes receive by outer pressure a leader whom they had not
recognized before manifestly there is here a certain palpable gain
yet there is also irreparable loss a loss of that peculiarly valuable
education which a group receives when by search and criticism it finds
and commissions its own leaders the way in which this is done is at
once the most elementary and the nicest problem of social growth
history is but the record of such group leadership and yet how
infinitely changeful is its type and character and of all types and
kinds what can be more instructive than the leadership of a group
within a group that curious double movement where real progress may
be negative and actual advance be relative retrogression all this is
now in the past the american negro has had instructive experience in
the choosing of group leaders founding thus a peculiar dynasty which
in the light of present conditions is worth while studying when
sticks and stones and beasts form the sole environment of a people
their attitude is largely one of determined opposition to and conquest
of natural forces but when to earth and brute is added an environment
of men and ideas then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take
three main forms a feeling of revolt and revenge an attempt to
adjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group or
finally a determined effort at self realization and self development
despite environing opinion the influence of all of these attitudes at
various times can be traced in the history of the american negro and
before 1750 while the fire of african freedom still burned in the
veins of the slaves there was in all leadership or attempted
leadership but the one motive of revolt and revenge typified in the
terrible maroons the danish blacks and cato of stono and veiling all
the americas in fear of insurrection the liberalizing tendencies of
the latter half of the eighteenth century brought along with kindlier
relations between black and white thoughts of ultimate adjustment and
assimilation such aspiration was especially voiced in the earnest
songs of phyllis in the martyrdom of attucks the fighting of salem
and poor the intellectual accomplishments of banneker and derham and
stern financial and social stress after the war cooled much of the
previous humanitarian ardor the disappointment and impatience of the
negroes at the persistence of slavery and serfdom voiced itself in two
movements the slaves in the south aroused undoubtedly by vague
rumors of the haytian revolt made three fierce attempts at
insurrection in 1800 under gabriel in virginia in 1822 under vesey
in carolina and in 1831 again in virginia under the terrible nat
turner in the free states on the other hand a new and curious
attempt at self development was made in philadelphia and new york
color prescription led to a withdrawal of negro communicants from white
churches and the formation of a peculiar socio religious institution
among the negroes known as the african church an organization still
living and controlling in its various branches over a million of men
walkers wild appeal against the trend of the times showed how the
world was changing after the coming of the cotton gin by 1830 slavery
seemed hopelessly fastened on the south and the slaves thoroughly
cowed into submission the free negroes of the north inspired by the
mulatto immigrants from the west indies began to change the basis of
their demands they recognized the slavery of slaves but insisted that
they themselves were freemen and sought assimilation and amalgamation
with the nation on the same terms with other men thus forten and
purvis of philadelphia shad of wilmington du bois of new haven
barbadoes of boston and others strove singly and together as men
they said not as slaves as people of color not as negroes the
trend of the times however refused them recognition save in
individual and exceptional cases considered them as one with all the
despised blacks and they soon found themselves striving to keep even
the rights they formerly had of voting and working and moving as
freemen schemes of migration and colonization arose among them but
these they refused to entertain and they eventually turned to the
here led by remond nell wells brown and douglass a new period of
self assertion and self development dawned to be sure ultimate
freedom and assimilation was the ideal before the leaders but the
assertion of the manhood rights of the negro by himself was the main
reliance and john browns raid was the extreme of its logic after
the war and emancipation the great form of frederick douglass the
greatest of american negro leaders still led the host
self assertion especially in political lines was the main programme
and behind douglass came elliot bruce and langston and the
reconstruction politicians and less conspicuous but of greater social
then came the revolution of 1876 the suppression of the negro votes
the changing and shifting of ideals and the seeking of new lights in
the great night douglass in his old age still bravely stood for the
ideals of his early manhood ultimate assimilation through
self assertion and on no other terms for a time price arose as a new
leader destined it seemed not to give up but to re state the old
ideals in a form less repugnant to the white south but he passed away
in his prime then came the new leader nearly all the former ones
had become leaders by the silent suffrage of their fellows had sought
to lead their own people alone and were usually save douglass little
known outside their race but booker t washington arose as
essentially the leader not of one race but of two a compromiser
between the south the north and the negro naturally the negroes
resented at first bitterly signs of compromise which surrendered
their civil and political rights even though this was to be exchanged
for larger chances of economic development the rich and dominating
north however was not only weary of the race problem but was
investing largely in southern enterprises and welcomed any method of
peaceful cooperation thus by national opinion the negroes began to
recognize mr washingtons leadership and the voice of criticism was
mr washington represents in negro thought the old attitude of
adjustment and submission but adjustment at such a peculiar time as to
make his programme unique this is an age of unusual economic
development and mr washingtons programme naturally takes an economic
cast becoming a gospel of work and money to such an extent as
apparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of life
moreover this is an age when the more advanced races are coming in
closer contact with the less developed races and the race feeling is
accepts the alleged inferiority of the negro races again in our own
land the reaction from the sentiment of war time has given impetus to
race prejudice against negroes and mr washington withdraws many of
the high demands of negroes as men and american citizens in other
periods of intensified prejudice all the negros tendency to
self assertion has been called forth at this period a policy of
submission is advocated in the history of nearly all other races and
peoples the doctrine preached at such crises has been that manly
self respect is worth more than lands and houses and that a people who
voluntarily surrender such respect or cease striving for it are not
in answer to this it has been claimed that the negro can survive only
through submission mr washington distinctly asks that black people
give up at least for the present three things
third higher education of negro youth and concentrate all their
energies on industrial education and accumulation of wealth and the
conciliation of the south this policy has been courageously and
insistently advocated for over fifteen years and has been triumphant
for perhaps ten years as a result of this tender of the palm branch
what has been the return in these years there have occurred
2 the legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for
3 the steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher
these movements are not to be sure direct results of mr washingtons
teachings but his propaganda has without a shadow of doubt helped
their speedier accomplishment the question then comes is it
possible and probable that nine millions of men can make effective
progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights
made a servile caste and allowed only the most meagre chance for
developing their exceptional men if history and reason give any
distinct answer to these questions it is an emphatic no and mr
washington thus faces the triple paradox of his career
1 he is striving nobly to make negro artisans business men and
property owners but it is utterly impossible under modern competitive
methods for workingmen and property owners to defend their rights and
2 he insists on thrift and self respect but at the same time
counsels a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to
sap the manhood of any race in the long run
3 he advocates common school and industrial training and depreciates
institutions of higher learning but neither the negro common schools
nor tuskegee itself could remain open a day were it not for teachers
trained in negro colleges or trained by their graduates
this triple paradox in mr washingtons position is the object of
criticism by two classes of colored americans one class is
spiritually descended from toussaint the savior through gabriel
vesey and turner and they represent the attitude of revolt and
revenge they hate the white south blindly and distrust the white race
generally and so far as they agree on definite action think that the
negros only hope lies in emigration beyond the borders of the united
states and yet by the irony of fate nothing has more effectually
made this programme seem hopeless than the recent course of the united
states toward weaker and darker peoples in the west indies hawaii and
the philippines for where in the world may we go and be safe from
the other class of negroes who cannot agree with mr washington has
hitherto said little aloud they deprecate the sight of scattered
counsels of internal disagreement and especially they dislike making
their just criticism of a useful and earnest man an excuse for a
general discharge of venom from small minded opponents nevertheless
the questions involved are so fundamental and serious that it is
difficult to see how men like the grimkes kelly miller j w e
bowen and other representatives of this group can much longer be
silent such men feel in conscience bound to ask of this nation three
3 the education of youth according to ability they acknowledge mr
washingtons invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy in
such demands they do not ask that ignorant black men vote when
ignorant whites are debarred or that any reasonable restrictions in
the suffrage should not be applied they know that the low social level
of the mass of the race is responsible for much discrimination against
it but they also know and the nation knows that relentless
color prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the negros
degradation they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism and
not its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies of
social power from the associated press to the church of christ they
advocate with mr washington a broad system of negro common schools
supplemented by thorough industrial training but they are surprised
that a man of mr washingtons insight cannot see that no such
educational system ever has rested or can rest on any other basis than
that of the well equipped college and university and they insist that
there is a demand for a few such institutions throughout the south to
train the best of the negro youth as teachers professional men and
this group of men honor mr washington for his attitude of conciliation
toward the white south they accept the atlanta compromise in its
broadest interpretation they recognize with him many signs of
promise many men of high purpose and fair judgment in this section
they know that no easy task has been laid upon a region already
tottering under heavy burdens but nevertheless they insist that the
way to truth and right lies in straightforward honesty not in
indiscriminate flattery in praising those of the south who do well and
criticising uncompromisingly those who do ill in taking advantage of
the opportunities at hand and urging their fellows to do the same but
at the same time in remembering that only a firm adherence to their
higher ideals and aspirations will ever keep those ideals within the
realm of possibility they do not expect that the free right to vote
to enjoy civic rights and to be educated will come in a moment they
do not expect to see the bias and prejudices of years disappear at the
blast of a trumpet but they are absolutely certain that the way for a
people to gain their reasonable rights is not by voluntarily throwing
them away and insisting that they do not want them that the way for a
people to gain respect is not by continually belittling and ridiculing
themselves that on the contrary negroes must insist continually in
season and out of season that voting is necessary to modern manhood
that color discrimination is barbarism and that black boys need
in failing thus to state plainly and unequivocally the legitimate
demands of their people even at the cost of opposing an honored
leader the thinking classes of american negroes would shirk a heavy
responsibility a responsibility to themselves a responsibility to
the struggling masses a responsibility to the darker races of men
whose future depends so largely on this american experiment but
especially a responsibility to this nation this common fatherland
it is wrong to encourage a man or a people in evil doing it is wrong
to aid and abet a national crime simply because it is unpopular not to
do so the growing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the
north and south after the frightful difference of a generation ago
ought to be a source of deep congratulation to all and especially to
those whose mistreatment caused the war but if that reconciliation is
to be marked by the industrial slavery and civic death of those same
black men with permanent legislation into a position of inferiority
then those black men if they are really men are called upon by every
consideration of patriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all
civilized methods even though such opposition involves disagreement
with mr booker t washington we have no right to sit silently by
while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our
first it is the duty of black men to judge the south discriminatingly
the present generation of southerners are not responsible for the past
and they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it furthermore to
no class is the indiscriminate endorsement of the recent course of the
south toward negroes more nauseating than to the best thought of the
south the south is not solid it is a land in the ferment of social
change wherein forces of all kinds are fighting for supremacy and to
praise the ill the south is today perpetrating is just as wrong as to
condemn the good discriminating and broad minded criticism is what
the south needs needs it for the sake of her own white sons and
daughters and for the insurance of robust healthy mental and moral
today even the attitude of the southern whites toward the blacks is
not as so many assume in all cases the same the ignorant southerner
hates the negro the workingmen fear his competition the money makers
wish to use him as a laborer some of the educated see a menace in his
upward development while others usually the sons of the masters wish
to help him to rise national opinion has enabled this last class to
maintain the negro common schools and to protect the negro partially
in property life and limb through the pressure of the money makers
the negro is in danger of being reduced to semi slavery especially in
the country districts the workingmen and those of the educated who
fear the negro have united to disfranchise him and some have urged
his deportation while the passions of the ignorant are easily aroused
to lynch and abuse any black man to praise this intricate whirl of
thought and prejudice is nonsense to inveigh indiscriminately against
the south is unjust but to use the same breath in praising governor
aycock exposing senator morgan arguing with mr thomas nelson page
and denouncing senator ben tillman is not only sane but the
it would be unjust to mr washington not to acknowledge that in several
instances he has opposed movements in the south which were unjust to
the negro he sent memorials to the louisiana and alabama
constitutional conventions he has spoken against lynching and in
other ways has openly or silently set his influence against sinister
schemes and unfortunate happenings notwithstanding this it is
equally true to assert that on the whole the distinct impression left
by mr washingtons propaganda is first that the south is justified
in its present attitude toward the negro because of the negros
degradation secondly that the prime cause of the negros failure to
rise more quickly is his wrong education in the past and thirdly
that his future rise depends primarily on his own efforts each of
these propositions is a dangerous half truth the supplementary truths
must never be lost sight of first slavery and race prejudice are
potent if not sufficient causes of the negros position second
industrial and common school training were necessarily slow in planting
because they had to await the black teachers trained by higher
institutions it being extremely doubtful if any essentially different
development was possible and certainly a tuskegee was unthinkable
before 1880 and third while it is a great truth to say that the
negro must strive and strive mightily to help himself it is equally
true that unless his striving be not simply seconded but rather
aroused and encouraged by the initiative of the richer and wiser
environing group he cannot hope for great success
in his failure to realize and impress this last point mr washington
is especially to be criticised his doctrine has tended to make the
whites north and south shift the burden of the negro problem to the
negros shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic
spectators when in fact the burden belongs to the nation and the
hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting
the south ought to be led by candid and honest criticism to assert
her better self and do her full duty to the race she has cruelly
wronged and is still wronging the north her co partner in
guilt cannot salve her conscience by plastering it with gold we
cannot settle this problem by diplomacy and suaveness by policy
alone if worse come to worst can the moral fibre of this country
survive the slow throttling and murder of nine millions of men
the black men of america have a duty to perform a duty stern and
delicate a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their
greatest leader so far as mr washington preaches thrift patience
and industrial training for the masses we must hold up his hands and
strive with him rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength
of this joshua called of god and of man to lead the headless host but
so far as mr washington apologizes for injustice north or south does
not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting belittles the
emasculating effects of caste distinctions and opposes the higher
training and ambition of our brighter minds so far as he the south
or the nation does this we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them
by every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights
which the world accords to men clinging unwaveringly to those great
words which the sons of the fathers would fain forget we hold these
truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they
are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that
among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
once upon a time i taught school in the hills of tennessee where the
broad dark vale of the mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet
the alleghanies i was a fisk student then and all fisk men thought
that tennessee beyond the veil was theirs alone and in vacation time
they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county
school commissioners young and happy i too went and i shall not
first there was a teachers institute at the county seat and there
distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers
fractions and spelling and other mysteries white teachers in the
morning negroes at night a picnic now and then and a supper and
the rough world was softened by laughter and song i remember how
there came a day when all the teachers left the institute and began the
hunt for schools i learn from hearsay for my mother was mortally
afraid of firearms that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is
wonderfully interesting but i am sure that the man who has never
hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the
chase i see now the white hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind
before me under the burning july sun i feel the deep weariness of
heart and limb as ten eight six miles stretch relentlessly ahead i
feel my heart sink heavily as i hear again and again got a teacher
yes so i walked on and on horses were too expensive until i had
wandered beyond railways beyond stage lines to a land of varmints
and rattlesnakes where the coming of a stranger was an event and men
lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill
sprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses shut out from
the world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east there
i found at last a little school josie told me of it she was a thin
homely girl of twenty with a dark brown face and thick hard hair i
had crossed the stream at watertown and rested under the great
willows then i had gone to the little cabin in the lot where josie was
resting on her way to town the gaunt farmer made me welcome and
josie hearing my errand told me anxiously that they wanted a school
over the hill that but once since the war had a teacher been there
that she herself longed to learn and thus she ran on talking fast
next morning i crossed the tall round hill lingered to look at the
blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the carolinas then plunged
into the wood and came out at josies home it was a dull frame
cottage with four rooms perched just below the brow of the hill amid
peach trees the father was a quiet simple soul calmly ignorant
with no touch of vulgarity the mother was different strong
bustling and energetic with a quick restless tongue and an ambition
to live like folks there was a crowd of children two boys had gone
away there remained two growing girls a shy midget of eight john
tall awkward and eighteen jim younger quicker and better looking
and two babies of indefinite age then there was josie herself she
seemed to be the centre of the family always busy at service or at
home or berry picking a little nervous and inclined to scold like
her mother yet faithful too like her father she had about her a
certain fineness the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would
willingly give all of life to make life broader deeper and fuller for
her and hers i saw much of this family afterwards and grew to love
them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable and for
their knowledge of their own ignorance there was with them no
affectation the mother would scold the father for being so easy
josie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness and all knew that
it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side hill
i secured the school i remember the day i rode horseback out to the
commissioners house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the
white school the road ran down the bed of a stream the sun laughed
and the water jingled and we rode on come in said the
commissioner come in have a seat yes that certificate will do
stay to dinner what do you want a month oh thought i this is
lucky but even then fell the awful shadow of the veil for they ate
the schoolhouse was a log hut where colonel wheeler used to shelter
his corn it sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes near
the sweetest of springs there was an entrance where a door once was
and within a massive rickety fireplace great chinks between the logs
served as windows furniture was scarce a pale blackboard crouched
in the corner my desk was made of three boards reinforced at
critical points and my chair borrowed from the landlady had to be
returned every night seats for the children these puzzled me much
i was haunted by a new england vision of neat little desks and chairs
but alas the reality was rough plank benches without backs and at
times without legs they had the one virtue of making naps
dangerous possibly fatal for the floor was not to be trusted
it was a hot morning late in july when the school opened i trembled
when i heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road and saw the
growing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me
first came josie and her brothers and sisters the longing to know to
be a student in the great school at nashville hovered like a star
above this child woman amid her work and worry and she studied
doggedly there were the dowells from their farm over toward
alexandria fanny with her smooth black face and wondering eyes
martha brown and dull the pretty girl wife of a brother and the
there were the burkes two brown and yellow lads and a tiny
haughty eyed girl fat reubens little chubby girl came with golden
face and old gold hair faithful and solemn thenie was on hand
early a jolly ugly good hearted girl who slyly dipped snuff and
looked after her little bow legged brother when her mother could
spare her tildy came a midnight beauty with starry eyes and
tapering limbs and her brother correspondingly homely and then the
big boys the hulking lawrences the lazy neills unfathered sons of
mother and daughter hickman with a stoop in his shoulders and the
there they sat nearly thirty of them on the rough benches their
faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown the little feet bare
and swinging the eyes full of expectation with here and there a
twinkle of mischief and the hands grasping websters blue black
spelling book i loved my school and the fine faith the children had
in the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvellous we read and
spelled together wrote a little picked flowers sang and listened to
stories of the world beyond the hill at times the school would
dwindle away and i would start out i would visit mun eddings who
lived in two very dirty rooms and ask why little lugene whose flaming
face seemed ever ablaze with the dark red hair uncombed was absent all
last week or why i missed so often the inimitable rags of mack and ed
then the father who worked colonel wheelers farm on shares would
tell me how the crops needed the boys and the thin slovenly mother
whose face was pretty when washed assured me that lugene must mind the
baby but well start them again next week when the lawrences
stopped i knew that the doubts of the old folks about book learning
had conquered again and so toiling up the hill and getting as far
into the cabin as possible i put cicero pro archia poeta into the
simplest english with local applications and usually convinced
on friday nights i often went home with some of the
children sometimes to doc burkes farm he was a great loud thin
black ever working and trying to buy the seventy five acres of hill
and dale where he lived but people said that he would surely fail and
the white folks would get it all his wife was a magnificent amazon
with saffron face and shining hair uncorseted and barefooted and the
children were strong and beautiful they lived in a
one and a half room cabin in the hollow of the farm near the spring
the front room was full of great fat white beds scrupulously neat and
there were bad chromos on the walls and a tired centre table in the
tiny back kitchen i was often invited to take out and help myself to
fried chicken and wheat biscuit meat and corn pone string beans and
berries at first i used to be a little alarmed at the approach of
bedtime in the one lone bedroom but embarrassment was very deftly
avoided first all the children nodded and slept and were stowed
away in one great pile of goose feathers next the mother and the
father discreetly slipped away to the kitchen while i went to bed
then blowing out the dim light they retired in the dark in the
morning all were up and away before i thought of awaking across the
road where fat reuben lived they all went outdoors while the teacher
retired because they did not boast the luxury of a kitchen
i liked to stay with the dowells for they had four rooms and plenty of
good country fare uncle bird had a small rough farm all woods and
hills miles from the big road but he was full of tales he preached
now and then and with his children berries horses and wheat he was
happy and prosperous often to keep the peace i must go where life
was less lovely for instance tildys mother was incorrigibly dirty
reubens larder was limited seriously and herds of untamed insects
wandered over the eddingses beds best of all i loved to go to
josies and sit on the porch eating peaches while the mother bustled
and talked how josie had bought the sewing machine how josie worked
at service in winter but that four dollars a month was mighty little
wages how josie longed to go away to school but that it looked like
they never could get far enough ahead to let her how the crops failed
and the well was yet unfinished and finally how mean some of the
for two summers i lived in this little world it was dull and humdrum
the girls looked at the hill in wistful longing and the boys fretted
and haunted alexandria alexandria was town a straggling lazy
village of houses churches and shops and an aristocracy of toms
dicks and captains cuddled on the hill to the north was the village
of the colored folks who lived in three or four room unpainted
cottages some neat and homelike and some dirty the dwellings were
scattered rather aimlessly but they centred about the twin temples of
the hamlet the methodist and the hard shell baptist churches these
in turn leaned gingerly on a sad colored schoolhouse hither my
little world wended its crooked way on sunday to meet other worlds and
gossip and wonder and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest
at the altar of the old time religion then the soft melody and
mighty cadences of negro song fluttered and thundered
i have called my tiny community a world and so its isolation made it
and yet there was among us but a half awakened common consciousness
sprung from common joy and grief at burial birth or wedding from a
common hardship in poverty poor land and low wages and above all
from the sight of the veil that hung between us and opportunity all
this caused us to think some thoughts together but these when ripe
for speech were spoken in various languages those whose eyes
twenty five and more years before had seen the glory of the coming of
the lord saw in every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound
to bring all things right in his own good time the mass of those to
whom slavery was a dim recollection of childhood found the world a
puzzling thing it asked little of them and they answered with little
and yet it ridiculed their offering such a paradox they could not
understand and therefore sank into listless indifference or
shiftlessness or reckless bravado there were however some such as
josie jim and ben to whom war hell and slavery were but childhood
tales whose young appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and
story and half awakened thought ill could they be content born
without and beyond the world and their weak wings beat against their
barriers barriers of caste of youth of life at last in dangerous
moments against everything that opposed even a whim
the ten years that follow youth the years when first the realization
comes that life is leading somewhere these were the years that passed
after i left my little school when they were past i came by chance
once more to the walls of fisk university to the halls of the chapel
of melody as i lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old
school friends there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again
beyond the blue hill and to see the homes and the school of other
days and to learn how life had gone with my school children and i
josie was dead and the gray haired mother said simply weve had a
heap of trouble since youve been away i had feared for jim with a
cultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him he might have made
a venturesome merchant or a west point cadet but here he was angry
with life and reckless and when fanner durham charged him with
stealing wheat the old man had to ride fast to escape the stones which
the furious fool hurled after him they told jim to run away but he
would not run and the constable came that afternoon it grieved
josie and great awkward john walked nine miles every day to see his
little brother through the bars of lebanon jail at last the two came
back together in the dark night the mother cooked supper and josie
emptied her purse and the boys stole away josie grew thin and
silent yet worked the more the hill became steep for the quiet old
father and with the boys away there was little to do in the valley
josie helped them to sell the old farm and they moved nearer town
brother dennis the carpenter built a new house with six rooms josie
toiled a year in nashville and brought back ninety dollars to furnish
the house and change it to a home
when the spring came and the birds twittered and the stream ran proud
and full little sister lizzie bold and thoughtless flushed with the
passion of youth bestowed herself on the tempter and brought home a
nameless child josie shivered and worked on with the vision of
schooldays all fled with a face wan and tired worked until on a
summers day some one married another then josie crept to her mother
like a hurt child and slept and sleeps
i paused to scent the breeze as i entered the valley the lawrences
have gone father and son forever and the other son lazily digs in
the earth to live a new young widow rents out their cabin to fat
reuben reuben is a baptist preacher now but i fear as lazy as ever
though his cabin has three rooms and little ella has grown into a
bouncing woman and is ploughing corn on the hot hillside there are
babies a plenty and one half witted girl across the valley is a
house i did not know before and there i found rocking one baby and
expecting another one of my schoolgirls a daughter of uncle bird
dowell she looked somewhat worried with her new duties but soon
bristled into pride over her neat cabin and the tale of her thrifty
husband and the horse and cow and the farm they were planning to buy
my log schoolhouse was gone in its place stood progress and
progress i understand is necessarily ugly the crazy foundation
stones still marked the former site of my poor little cabin and not
far away on six weary boulders perched a jaunty board house perhaps
twenty by thirty feet with three windows and a door that locked some
of the window glass was broken and part of an old iron stove lay
mournfully under the house i peeped through the window half
reverently and found things that were more familiar the blackboard
had grown by about two feet and the seats were still without backs
the county owns the lot now i hear and every year there is a session
of school as i sat by the spring and looked on the old and the new i
after two long drinks i started on there was the great double
log house on the corner i remembered the broken blighted family that
used to live there the strong hard face of the mother with its
wilderness of hair rose before me she had driven her husband away
and while i taught school a strange man lived there big and jovial
and people talked i felt sure that ben and tildy would come to
naught from such a home but this is an odd world for ben is a busy
farmer in smith county doing well too they say and he had cared
for little tildy until last spring when a lover married her a hard
life the lad had led toiling for meat and laughed at because he was
homely and crooked there was sam carlon an impudent old skinflint
who had definite notions about niggers and hired ben a summer and
would not pay him then the hungry boy gathered his sacks together
and in broad daylight went into carlons corn and when the hard fisted
farmer set upon him the angry boy flew at him like a beast doc burke
saved a murder and a lynching that day
the story reminded me again of the burkes and an impatience seized me
to know who won in the battle doc or the seventy five acres for it
is a hard thing to make a farm out of nothing even in fifteen years
so i hurried on thinking of the burkes they used to have a certain
magnificent barbarism about them that i liked they were never vulgar
never immoral but rather rough and primitive with an
unconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws slaps on the back
and naps in the corner i hurried by the cottage of the misborn neill
boys it was empty and they were grown into fat lazy farm hands i
saw the home of the hickmans but albert with his stooping shoulders
had passed from the world then i came to the burkes gate and peered
through the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed and yet there were
the same fences around the old farm save to the left where lay
twenty five other acres and lo the cabin in the hollow had climbed
the hill and swollen to a half finished six room cottage
the burkes held a hundred acres but they were still in debt indeed
the gaunt father who toiled night and day would scarcely be happy out
of debt being so used to it some day he must stop for his massive
frame is showing decline the mother wore shoes but the lion like
physique of other days was broken the children had grown up rob
the image of his father was loud and rough with laughter birdie my
school baby of six had grown to a picture of maiden beauty tall and
tawny edgar is gone said the mother with head half bowed gone
to work in nashville he and his father couldnt agree
little doc the boy born since the time of my school took me horseback
down the creek next morning toward farmer dowells the road and the
stream were battling for mastery and the stream had the better of it
we splashed and waded and the merry boy perched behind me chattered
and laughed he showed me where simon thompson had bought a bit of
ground and a home but his daughter lana a plump brown slow girl
was not there she had married a man and a farm twenty miles away we
wound on down the stream till we came to a gate that i did not
recognize but the boy insisted that it was uncle birds the farm
was fat with the growing crop in that little valley was a strange
stillness as i rode up for death and marriage had stolen youth and
left age and childhood there we sat and talked that night after the
chores were done uncle bird was grayer and his eyes did not see so
well but he was still jovial we talked of the acres bought one
hundred and twenty five of the new guest chamber added of marthas
marrying then we talked of death fanny and fred were gone a shadow
hung over the other daughter and when it lifted she was to go to
nashville to school at last we spoke of the neighbors and as night
fell uncle bird told me how on a night like that thenie came
wandering back to her home over yonder to escape the blows of her
husband and next morning she died in the home that her little
bow legged brother working and saving had bought for their widowed
my journey was done and behind me lay hill and dale and life and
death how shall man measure progress there where the dark faced josie
lies how many heartfuls of sorrow shall balance a bushel of wheat
how hard a thing is life to the lowly and yet how human and real and
all this life and love and strife and failure is it the twilight of
nightfall or the flush of some faint dawning day
thus sadly musing i rode to nashville in the jim crow car
south of the north yet north of the south lies the city of a hundred
hills peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the
future i have seen her in the morning when the first flush of day
had half roused her she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of
georgia then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys the
tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence the rattle and
