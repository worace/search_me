m gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking
thats right one and twenty years of age no profession twelve
hundred livres a year madame la baronne de pontmercy will go and
purchase a couple of sous worth of parsley from the fruiterer
sir repeated marius in the despair at the last hope which was
vanishing i entreat you i conjure you in the name of heaven with
clasped hands sir i throw myself at your feet permit me to marry
the old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter
ah ah ah you said to yourself pardine ill go hunt up that old
blockhead that absurd numskull what a shame that im not twenty five
how id treat him to a nice respectful summons how nicely id get along
without him its nothing to me id say to him youre only too happy
to see me you old idiot i want to marry i desire to wed mamselle
no matter whom daughter of monsieur no matter what i have no shoes
she has no chemise that just suits i want to throw my career my
future my youth my life to the dogs i wish to take a plunge into
wretchedness with a woman around my neck thats an idea and you must
consent to it and the old fossil will consent go my lad do as
you like attach your paving stone marry your pousselevent your
at the tone in which that never was uttered marius lost all hope he
traversed the chamber with slow steps with bowed head tottering and
more like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure m
gillenormand followed him with his eyes and at the moment when the
door opened and marius was on the point of going out he advanced four
paces with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen
seized marius by the collar brought him back energetically into the
room flung him into an armchair and said to him
it was that single word father which had effected this revolution
marius stared at him in bewilderment m gillenormands mobile face was
no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good nature
the grandsire had given way before the grandfather
come see here speak tell me about your love affairs jabber tell me
the old mans entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance
yes thats right call me father and youll see
there was now something so kind so gentle so openhearted and so
paternal in this brusqueness that marius in the sudden transition from
discouragement to hope was stunned and intoxicated by it as it were
he was seated near the table the light from the candles brought out
the dilapidation of his costume which father gillenormand regarded with
ah by the way interrupted m gillenormand you really have not a
penny then you are dressed like a pickpocket
he rummaged in a drawer drew forth a purse which he laid on the table
here are a hundred louis buy yourself a hat
father pursued marius my good father if you only knew i love her
you cannot imagine it the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg
she came there in the beginning i did not pay much heed to her and
then i dont know how it came about i fell in love with her oh how
unhappy that made me now at last i see her every day at her own
home her father does not know it just fancy they are going away it
is in the garden that we meet in the evening her father means to take
her to england then i said to myself ill go and see my grandfather
and tell him all about the affair i should go mad first i should die
i should fall ill i should throw myself into the water i absolutely
must marry her since i should go mad otherwise this is the whole
truth and i do not think that i have omitted anything she lives in a
garden with an iron fence in the rue plumet it is in the neighborhood
father gillenormand had seated himself with a beaming countenance
beside marius as he listened to him and drank in the sound of his
voice he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff at
the words rue plumet he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the
remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees
the rue plumet the rue plumet did you say let us see are there
not barracks in that vicinity why yes thats it your cousin
theodule has spoken to me about it the lancer the officer a gay girl
my good friend a gay girl pardieu yes the rue plumet it is what
used to be called the rue blomet it all comes back to me now i have
heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet in a
garden a pamela your taste is not bad she is said to be a very tidy
creature between ourselves i think that simpleton of a lancer has been
courting her a bit i dont know where he did it however thats not
to the purpose besides he is not to be believed he brags marius i
think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love its
the right thing at your age i like you better as a lover than as a
jacobin i like you better in love with a petticoat sapristi with
twenty petticoats than with m de robespierre for my part i will do
myself the justice to say that in the line of sans culottes i have
never loved any one but women pretty girls are pretty girls the deuce
theres no objection to that as for the little one she receives you
without her fathers knowledge thats in the established order of
things i have had adventures of that same sort myself more than one
do you know what is done then one does not take the matter ferociously
one does not precipitate himself into the tragic one does not make
ones mind to marriage and m le maire with his scarf one simply
behaves like a fellow of spirit one shows good sense slip along
mortals dont marry you come and look up your grandfather who is a
good natured fellow at bottom and who always has a few rolls of louis
in an old drawer you say to him see here grandfather and the
grandfather says thats a simple matter youth must amuse itself and
old age must wear out i have been young you will be old come my boy
you shall pass it on to your grandson here are two hundred pistoles
amuse yourself deuce take it nothing better thats the way the
affair should be treated you dont marry but that does no harm you
marius petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable made a sign with
the old man burst out laughing winked his aged eye gave him a slap on
the knee stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air
and said to him with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder
marius turned pale he had understood nothing of what his grandfather
had just said this twaddle about the rue blomet pamela the barracks
the lancer had passed before marius like a dissolving view nothing of
all that could bear any reference to cosette who was a lily the good
man was wandering in his mind but this wandering terminated in words
which marius did understand and which were a mortal insult to cosette
those words make her your mistress entered the heart of the strict
he rose picked up his hat which lay on the floor and walked to the
door with a firm assured step there he turned round bowed deeply to
his grandfather raised his head erect again and said
five years ago you insulted my father to day you have insulted my
wife i ask nothing more of you sir farewell
father gillenormand utterly confounded opened his mouth extended his
arms tried to rise and before he could utter a word the door closed
the old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though
struck by lightning without the power to speak or breathe as though
a clenched fist grasped his throat at last he tore himself from his
arm chair ran so far as a man can run at ninety one to the door
his daughter made her appearance then the domestics he began again
with a pitiful rattle run after him bring him back what have i done
to him he is mad he is going away ah my god ah my god this time
he went to the window which looked out on the street threw it open with
his aged and palsied hands leaned out more than half way while basque
but marius could no longer hear him for at that moment he was turning
the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times
with an expression of anguish recoiled tottering and fell back into an
arm chair pulseless voiceless tearless with quivering head and lips
which moved with a stupid air with nothing in his eyes and nothing
any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which
that same day towards four oclock in the afternoon jean valjean was
sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the
champ de mars either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or
simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which
gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one he now
rarely went out with cosette he had on his workmans waistcoat
and trousers of gray linen and his long visored cap concealed his
he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time
alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last week or
two anxieties of another nature had come up one day while walking
on the boulevard he had caught sight of thenardier thanks to his
disguise thenardier had not recognized him but since that day jean
valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that thenardier
this had been sufficient to make him come to a decision
moreover paris was not tranquil political troubles presented this
inconvenient feature for any one who had anything to conceal in his
life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and
that while seeking to ferret out a man like pepin or morey they might
very readily discover a man like jean valjean
jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go
he had warned cosette he wished to set out before the end of the week
he had seated himself on the slope in the champ de mars turning over
all sorts of thoughts in his mind thenardier the police the journey
he was troubled from all these points of view
last of all an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his
attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his
on the morning of that very day when he alone of the household was
stirring while strolling in the garden before cosettes shutters
were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall the following line
this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were
white a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the
this had probably been written on the preceding night
what was this a signal for others a warning for himself
in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that
he recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household
his mind was now filling in this canvas
he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the
in the midst of his preoccupations he perceived from a shadow cast by
the sun that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately
he was on the point of turning round when a paper folded in four fell
upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head
he took the paper unfolded it and read these words written in large
jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope
he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a
child not so large as a man clad in a gray blouse and trousers of
dust colored cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who
slipped into the moat of the champde mars
jean valjean returned home at once in a very thoughtful mood
marius had left m gillenormand in despair he had entered the house
with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair
however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will
understand this the officer the lancer the ninny cousin theodule
had left no trace in his mind not the slightest the dramatic poet
might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made
point blank by the grandfather to the grandson but what the drama would
gain thereby truth would lose marius was at an age when one believes
nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes
everything suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles early youth
has none of them that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over
candide suspect cosette there are hosts of crimes which marius could
he began to wander about the streets the resource of those who suffer
he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember at two
oclock in the morning he returned to courfeyracs quarters and flung
himself without undressing on his mattress the sun was shining
brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits
ideas to go and come in the brain when he awoke he saw courfeyrac
enjolras feuilly and combeferre standing in the room with their hats
it seemed to him that courfeyrac was speaking chinese
he went out some time after them he put in his pocket the pistols which
javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of february
and which had remained in his hands these pistols were still loaded it
would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he
all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going it
rained at times he did not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a
penny roll at a bakers put it in his pocket and forgot it it appears
that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it there are
moments when a man has a furnace within his skull marius was passing
through one of those moments he no longer hoped for anything this
step he had taken since the preceding evening he waited for night with
feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his mind this
was that at nine oclock he should see cosette this last happiness
now constituted his whole future after that gloom at intervals as
he roamed through the most deserted boulevards it seemed to him that he
heard strange noises in paris he thrust his head out of his revery and
at nightfall at nine oclock precisely as he had promised cosette
he was in the rue plumet when he approached the grating he forgot
everything it was forty eight hours since he had seen cosette he was
about to behold her once more every other thought was effaced and
he felt only a profound and unheard of joy those minutes in which one
lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that
at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely
marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden cosette
was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him he traversed
the thicket and approached the recess near the flight of steps she
is waiting for me there said he cosette was not there he raised his
eyes and saw that the shutters of the house were closed he made the
tour of the garden the garden was deserted then he returned to
the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified
exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at
an evil hour he tapped on the shutters he knocked and knocked again
at the risk of seeing the window open and her fathers gloomy face
make its appearance and demand what do you want this was nothing in
comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of when he had rapped
he lifted up his voice and called cosette cosette he cried
cosette he repeated imperiously there was no reply all was over no
one in the garden no one in the house
marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house which was as
black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty he gazed at the stone
seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with cosette then he
seated himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness
and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and
he said to himself that since cosette was gone all that there was left
all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street
and which was calling to him through the trees
mr marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you at
the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie
this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him it resembled the hoarse
rough voice of eponine marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the
movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw some one who
appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom
jean valjeans purse was of no use to m mabeuf m mabeuf in his
venerable infantile austerity had not accepted the gift of the stars
he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis dor he
had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from gavroche
he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter as
a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants the
purse was actually lost it is unnecessary to say that no one claimed
it and that it did not succor m mabeuf
moreover m mabeuf had continued his downward course
his experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the jardin des
plantes than in his garden at austerlitz the year before he had owed
his housekeepers wages now as we have seen he owed three quarters
of his rent the pawnshop had sold the plates of his flora after the
expiration of thirteen months some coppersmith had made stewpans of
them his copper plates gone and being unable to complete even the
incomplete copies of his flora which were in his possession he had
disposed of the text at a miserable price as waste paper to a
second hand bookseller nothing now remained to him of his lifes work
he set to work to eat up the money for these copies when he saw that
this wretched resource was becoming exhausted he gave up his garden
and allowed it to run to waste before this a long time before he had
given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time
to time he dined on bread and potatoes he had sold the last of his
furniture then all duplicates of his bedding his clothing and his
blankets then his herbariums and prints but he still retained his most
precious books many of which were of the greatest rarity among others
les quadrins historiques de la bible edition of 1560 la concordance
des bibles by pierre de besse les marguerites de la marguerite of
jean de la haye with a dedication to the queen of navarre the book de
la charge et dignite de lambassadeur by the sieur de villiers
hotman a florilegium rabbinicum of 1644 a tibullus of 1567 with this
magnificent inscription venetiis in aedibus manutianis and lastly a
diogenes laertius printed at lyons in 1644 which contained the famous
variant of the manuscript 411 thirteenth century of the vatican and
those of the two manuscripts of venice 393 and 394 consulted with
such fruitful results by henri estienne and all the passages in doric
dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth
century belonging to the naples library m mabeuf never had any fire
in his chamber and went to bed at sundown in order not to consume
any candles it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors people
avoided him when he went out he perceived the fact the wretchedness of
a child interests a mother the wretchedness of a young man interests a
young girl the wretchedness of an old man interests no one it is of
all distresses the coldest still father mabeuf had not entirely lost
his childlike serenity his eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested
on his books and he smiled when he gazed at the diogenes laertius
which was a unique copy his bookcase with glass doors was the
only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly
i have no money to buy any dinner
what she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes
m mabeuf opened his bookcase took a long look at all his books one
after another as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze
upon them before making a choice then seized one hastily put it
in under his arm and went out he returned two hours later without
anything under his arm laid thirty sous on the table and said
from that moment forth mother plutarque saw a sombre veil which was
never more lifted descend over the old mans candid face
on the following day on the day after and on the day after that it
m mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin as the
second hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell they purchased
of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs
sometimes at those very shops volume by volume the whole library
went the same road he said at times but i am eighty as though he
cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days
before reaching the end of his books his melancholy increased once
however he had a pleasure he had gone out with a robert estienne
which he had sold for thirty five sous under the quai malaquais and he
returned with an aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the rue des
gres i owe five sous he said beaming on mother plutarque that day
he belonged to the horticultural society his destitution became known
there the president of the society came to see him promised to
speak to the minister of agriculture and commerce about him and did
so why what exclaimed the minister i should think so an old
savant a botanist an inoffensive man something must be done for him
on the following day m mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the
minister trembling with joy he showed the letter to mother plutarque
we are saved said he on the day appointed he went to the ministers
house he perceived that his ragged cravat his long square coat and
his waxed shoes astonished the ushers no one spoke to him not even the
minister about ten oclock in the evening while he was still waiting
for a word he heard the ministers wife a beautiful woman in a
low necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach inquire who is
that old gentleman he returned home on foot at midnight in a driving
rain storm he had sold an elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go
he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes
laertius every night before he went to bed he knew enough greek to
enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned he had now no other
enjoyment several weeks passed all at once mother plutarque fell ill
there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread
at the bakers and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the
apothecarys one evening the doctor had ordered a very expensive
potion and the malady was growing worse a nurse was required m
mabeuf opened his bookcase there was nothing there the last volume had
taken its departure all that was left to him was diogenes laertius
he put this unique copy under his arm and went out it was the 4th of
june 1832 he went to the porte saint jacques to royals successor
and returned with one hundred francs he laid the pile of five franc
pieces on the old serving womans nightstand and returned to his
on the following morning at dawn he seated himself on the overturned
post in his garden and he could be seen over the top of the hedge
sitting the whole morning motionless with drooping head his eyes
vaguely fixed on the withered flower beds it rained at intervals the
old man did not seem to perceive the fact
in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris they
resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude
father mabeuf raised his head he saw a gardener passing and
the gardener spade on back replied in the most unconcerned tone
father mabeuf went to his room took his hat mechanically sought for a
book to place under his arm found none said ah truly and went off
of what is revolt composed of nothing and of everything of an
electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting
forth of a wandering force of a passing breath this breath encounters
heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions
which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away
at random athwart the state the laws athwart prosperity and the
instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has
been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change
the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to
take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love
the prompters whistle at the theatre the vague hatreds rancors
disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted
it discomfort empty dreams ambitious that are hedged about whoever
hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the
rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt
that which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl
outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants
vagabonds of the cross roads those who sleep at night in a desert of
houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who
each day demand their bread from chance and not from toil the unknown
of poverty and nothingness the bare armed the bare footed belong to
revolt whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed
whatever on the part of the state of life or of fate is ripe for riot
and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to
revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms
suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as it eddies
about mounts descends thunders tears razes crushes demolishes
uproots bearing with it great natures and small the strong man and the
feeble mind the tree trunk and the stalk of straw woe to him whom it
bears away as well as to him whom it strikes it breaks the one against
it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and
extraordinary power it fills the first comer with the force of events
it converts everything into projectiles it makes a cannon ball of a
rough stone and a general of a porter
if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views a little
revolt is desirable from the point of view of power system revolt
strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow it puts
the army to the test it consecrates the bourgeoisie it draws out
the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force of the social
framework it is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene power
is in better health after a revolt as a man is after a good rubbing
revolt thirty years ago was regarded from still other points of view
there is for everything a theory which proclaims itself good sense
philintus against alcestis mediation offered between the false and the
true explanation admonition rather haughty extenuation which because
it is mingled with blame and excuse thinks itself wisdom and is often
only pedantry a whole political school called the golden mean has
been the outcome of this as between cold water and hot water it is
the lukewarm water party this school with its false depth all on the
surface which dissects effects without going back to first causes
chides from its height of a demi science the agitation of the public
if we listen to this school the riots which complicated the affair
of 1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity the
revolution of july had been a fine popular gale abruptly followed
by blue sky they made the cloudy sky reappear they caused that
revolution at first so remarkable for its unanimity to degenerate into
a quarrel in the revolution of july as in all progress accomplished by
fits and starts there had been secret fractures these riots rendered
them perceptible it might have been said ah this is broken after
the revolution of july one was sensible only of deliverance after the
all revolt closes the shops depresses the funds throws the exchange
failures no more money private fortunes rendered uneasy public credit
shaken industry disconcerted capital withdrawing work at a discount
fear everywhere counter shocks in every town hence gulfs it has been
calculated that the first day of a riot costs france twenty millions
the second day forty the third sixty a three days uprising costs
one hundred and twenty millions that is to say if only the financial
result be taken into consideration it is equivalent to a disaster a
shipwreck or a lost battle which should annihilate a fleet of sixty
no doubt historically uprisings have their beauty the war of the
pavements is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of
thickets in the one there is the soul of forests in the other the
heart of cities the one has jean chouan the other has a jeanne
revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points
of the parisian character generosity devotion stormy gayety students
proving that bravery forms part of intelligence the national guard
invincible bivouacs of shopkeepers fortresses of street urchins
contempt of death on the part of passers by schools and legions clashed
together after all between the combatants there was only a difference
of age the race is the same it is the same stoical men who died at the
age of twenty for their ideas at forty for their families the
army always a sad thing in civil wars opposed prudence to audacity
uprisings while proving popular intrepidity also educated the courage
this is well but is all this worth the bloodshed and to the bloodshed
add the future darkness progress compromised uneasiness among the
best men honest liberals in despair foreign absolutism happy in these
wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand the vanquished of 1830
triumphing and saying we told you so add paris enlarged possibly
but france most assuredly diminished add for all must needs be told
the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown
ferocious over liberty gone mad to sum up all uprisings have been
thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie
that approximation to the people so willingly contents itself
for our parts we reject this word uprisings as too large and
consequently as too convenient we make a distinction between one
popular movement and another popular movement we do not inquire whether
an uprising costs as much as a battle why a battle in the first place
here the question of war comes up is war less of a scourge than an
uprising is of a calamity and then are all uprisings calamities and
what if the revolt of july did cost a hundred and twenty millions the
establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards even at
the same price we should prefer the 14th of july however we reject
these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words an
uprising being given we examine it by itself in all that is said by
the doctrinarian objection above presented there is no question of
there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as
insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the
wrong the other is in the right in democratic states the only ones
which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction
usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may
proceed as far as resort to arms in all questions which result from
collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the fraction is
insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt
according as the tuileries contain a king or the convention they
are justly or unjustly attacked the same cannon pointed against the
populace is wrong on the 10th of august and right on the 14th of
vendemiaire alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality
the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true that which
universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty
cannot be undone by the street it is the same in things pertaining
purely to civilization the instinct of the masses clear sighted
to day may be troubled to morrow the same fury legitimate when
directed against terray and absurd when directed against turgot the
destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of
rails the demolition of docks the false routes of multitudes the
refusal by the people of justice to progress ramus assassinated by
students rousseau driven out of switzerland and stoned that is
revolt israel against moses athens against phocian rome against
cicero that is an uprising paris against the bastille that is
insurrection the soldiers against alexander the sailors against
christopher columbus this is the same revolt impious revolt
why because alexander is doing for asia with the sword that which
christopher columbus is doing for america with the compass alexander
like columbus is finding a world these gifts of a world to
civilization are such augmentations of light that all resistance in
that case is culpable sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to
itself the masses are traitors to the people is there for example
anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in
contraband salt a legitimate chronic revolt which at the decisive
moment on the day of salvation at the very hour of popular victory
espouses the throne turns into chouannerie and from having been an
insurrection against becomes an uprising for sombre masterpieces of
ignorance the contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets and
with a ropes end round his neck mounts the white cockade death to
the salt duties brings forth long live the king the assassins of
saint barthelemy the cut throats of september the manslaughterers of
avignon the assassins of coligny the assassins of madam lamballe the
assassins of brune miquelets verdets cadenettes the companions of
jehu the chevaliers of brassard behold an uprising la vendee is
a grand catholic uprising the sound of right in movement is
recognizable it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited
masses there are mad rages there are cracked bells all tocsins do not
give out the sound of bronze the brawl of passions and ignorances
is quite another thing from the shock of progress show me in what
direction you are going rise if you will but let it be that you may
grow great there is no insurrection except in a forward direction any
other sort of rising is bad every violent step towards the rear is a
revolt to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human
race insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth the pavements
which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right these
pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud danton against louis
xiv is insurrection hebert against danton is revolt
hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be as
lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most
there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is
often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw
revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power
polignac is a rioter camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers
the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely
modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space
of four thousand years filled with violated right and the suffering of
peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it
is capable under the caesars there was no insurrection but there was
under the caesars there is the exile to syene there is also the man of
the annales we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his
part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the
ideal world who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on
rome nineveh on rome babylon on rome sodom the flaming reflection of
the apocalypse john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may
understand him he is a jew and it is hebrew but the man who writes
the annales is of the latin race let us rather say he is a roman
as the neros reign in a black way they should be painted to match the
work of the graving tool alone would be too pale there must be poured
into the channel a concentrated prose which bites
despots count for something in the question of philosophers a word that
is chained is a terrible word the writer doubles and trebles his style
when silence is imposed on a nation by its master from this silence
there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought
and there congeals into bronze the compression of history produces
conciseness in the historian the granite solidity of such and such a
celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant
tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are
augmentations of force the ciceronian period which hardly sufficed
for verres would be blunted on caligula the less spread of sail in
the phrase the more intensity in the blow tacitus thinks with all his
the honesty of a great heart condensed in justice and truth overwhelms
be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed
upon caesar the tiberii were reserved for him caesar and tacitus
are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be
mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the
stage regulates the entrances and the exits caesar is great tacitus
is great god spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash
with one another the guardian of justice in striking caesar might
strike too hard and be unjust god does not will it the great wars
of africa and spain the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization
introduced into gaul into britanny into germany all this glory
covers the rubicon there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine
justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the
formidable historian sparing caesar tacitus and according extenuating
certainly despotism remains despotism even under the despot of genius
there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is
still more hideous under infamous tyrants in such reigns nothing veils
the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal
slap this ignominy which cannot reply in the face more usefully in the
rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla under claudius and
under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the
repulsiveness of the tyrant the villainy of slaves is a direct product
of the despot a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein
the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small
consciences are dull souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla
thus it is under commodus thus it is under heliogabalus while from
the roman senate under caesar there comes nothing but the odor of the
dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles
hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacituses and the juvenals
it is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his
but juvenal and tacitus like isaiah in biblical times like dante in
the middle ages is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which
in the majority of cases riot proceeds from a material fact
insurrection is always a moral phenomenon riot is masaniello
insurrection spartacus insurrection borders on mind riot on the
stomach gaster grows irritated but gaster assuredly is not always in
the wrong in questions of famine riot buzancais for example holds a
true pathetic and just point of departure nevertheless it remains
a riot why it is because right at bottom it was wrong in form shy
although in the right violent although strong it struck at random it
walked like a blind elephant it left behind it the corpses of old
men of women and of children it wished the blood of inoffensive and
innocent persons without knowing why the nourishment of the people is a
good object to massacre them is a bad means
all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the 10th of
august even that of july 14th begin with the same troubles before
the right gets set free there is foam and tumult in the beginning the
insurrection is a riot just as a river is a torrent ordinarily it ends
in that ocean revolution sometimes however coming from those lofty
mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason
right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from
rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and
increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph
insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire as the rhine is in a
all this is of the past the future is another thing universal suffrage
has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception
and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms
the disappearance of wars of street wars as well as of wars on the
frontiers such is the inevitable progression whatever to day may be
however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former
and the latter the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such
shades in his mind all is sedition rebellion pure and simple the
revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be
punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day
as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the
then the bourgeois shouts long live the people
this explanation given what does the movement of june 1832 signify
so far as history is concerned is it a revolt is it an insurrection
it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to
say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts
and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and
this movement of 1832 had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy
extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an
uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it
is like a relic of 1830 excited imaginations say they are not to be
calmed in a day a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs
undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a
mountain sinking into the plain there are no alps without their jura
this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of
parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic
hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter
the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and
living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time
and space there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation
human tremor petty details as we think we have already said are so
to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of
history the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of
this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not
sounded the depths for another reason than history we shall therefore
bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things
which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed
the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the
actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the
very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we
shall be able to say we have seen this we alter a few names for
history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall
paint will be genuine in accordance with the conditions of the book
which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode
and certainly the least known at that of the two days the 5th and the
6th of june 1832 but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may
catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of
the real form of this frightful public adventure
chapter iii a burial an occasion to be born again
in the spring of 1832 although the cholera had been chilling all
minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an
indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe
for commotion as we have said the great city resembles a piece of
artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the
shot is discharged in june 1832 the spark was the death of general
lamarque was a man of renown and of action he had had in succession
under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery
requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the battle field and the
bravery of the tribune he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a
sword was discernible in his speech like foy his predecessor after
upholding the command he upheld liberty he sat between the left and
the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances
of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the
emperor well he was in company with comtes gerard and drouet one
of napoleons marshals in petto the treaties of 1815 removed him as
a personal offence he hated wellington with a downright hatred which
pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically
preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to
intervening events in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to
his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of
the hundred days napoleon had died uttering the word army lamarque
his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and
by the government as an occasion this death was an affliction like
everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt this is what
on the preceding evening and on the morning of the 5th of june the day
appointed for lamarques burial the faubourg saint antoine which the
procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect this tumultuous
network of streets was filled with rumors they armed themselves as best
they might joiners carried off door weights of their establishment
