not under shelter but in the open air a target for the intolerable rays
of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter thus are we gods
ministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein and
as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be
conducted without exceeding great sweat toil and exertion it follows
that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than
those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to god to
help the weak i do not mean to say nor does it enter into my thoughts
that the knight errants calling is as good as that of the monk in his
cell i would merely infer from what i endure myself that it is beyond a
doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one a hungrier and
thirstier a wretcheder raggeder and lousier for there is no reason to
doubt that the knights errant of yore endured much hardship in the course
of their lives and if some of them by the might of their arms did rise
to be emperors in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and
sweat and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and
sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their
that is my own opinion replied the traveller but one thing among
many others seems to me very wrong in knights errant and that is that
when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous
adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives they
never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to
god as is the duty of every good christian in like peril instead of
which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if
these were their gods a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of
sir answered don quixote that cannot be on any account omitted and
the knight errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise for it is usual
and customary in knight errantry that the knight errant who on engaging
in any great feat of arms has his lady before him should turn his eyes
towards her softly and lovingly as though with them entreating her to
favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake
and even though no one hear him he is bound to say certain words between
his teeth commending himself to her with all his heart and of this we
have innumerable instances in the histories nor is it to be supposed
from this that they are to omit commending themselves to god for there
will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their
for all that answered the traveller i feel some doubt still because
often i have read how words will arise between two knights errant and
from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and
they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field and then
without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge
and in mid career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies
and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the
haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonists
lance and as for the other it is only by holding on to the mane of his
horse that he can help falling to the ground but i know not how the dead
man had time to commend himself to god in the course of such rapid work
as this it would have been better if those words which he spent in
commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been
devoted to his duty and obligation as a christian moreover it is my
belief that all knights errant have not ladies to commend themselves to
that is impossible said don quixote i say it is impossible that
there could be a knight errant without a lady because to such it is as
natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars most
certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a
knight errant without an amour and for the simple reason that without
one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard and one who had
gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood not by the
door but over the wall like a thief and a robber
nevertheless said the traveller if i remember rightly i think i
have read that don galaor the brother of the valiant amadis of gaul
never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself and yet he
was not the less esteemed and was a very stout and famous knight
to which our don quixote made answer sir one solitary swallow does not
make summer moreover i know that knight was in secret very deeply in
love besides which that way of falling in love with all that took his
fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control but in short
it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his
will to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly for
he prided himself on being a reticent knight
then if it be essential that every knight errant should be in love
said the traveller it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so
as you are of the order and if you do not pride yourself on being as
reticent as don galaor i entreat you as earnestly as i can in the name
of all this company and in my own to inform us of the name country
rank and beauty of your lady for she will esteem herself fortunate if
all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your
at this don quixote heaved a deep sigh and said i cannot say positively
whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know i
serve her i can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked
of me that her name is dulcinea her country el toboso a village of la
mancha her rank must be at least that of a princess since she is my
queen and lady and her beauty superhuman since all the impossible and
fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are
verified in her for her hairs are gold her forehead elysian fields her
eyebrows rainbows her eyes suns her cheeks roses her lips coral her
teeth pearls her neck alabaster her bosom marble her hands ivory her
fairness snow and what modesty conceals from sight such i think and
imagine as rational reflection can only extol not compare
we should like to know her lineage race and ancestry said vivaldo
to which don quixote replied she is not of the ancient roman curtii
caii or scipios nor of the modern colonnas or orsini nor of the
moncadas or requesenes of catalonia nor yet of the rebellas or
villanovas of valencia palafoxes nuzas rocabertis corellas lunas
alagones urreas foces or gurreas of aragon cerdas manriques
mendozas or guzmans of castile alencastros pallas or meneses of
portugal but she is of those of el toboso of la mancha a lineage that
though modern may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most
illustrious families of the ages that are to come and this let none
dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino placed at the foot of
these let none move who dareth not his might with roland prove
although mine is of the cachopins of laredo said the traveller i
will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha
though to tell the truth no such surname has until now ever reached my
what said don quixote has that never reached them
the rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the
conversation of the pair and even the very goatherds and shepherds
perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our don quixote was sancho
panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth knowing who
he was and having known him from his birth and all that he felt any
difficulty in believing was that about the fair dulcinea del toboso
because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his
knowledge though he lived so close to el toboso they were going along
conversing in this way when they saw descending a gap between two high
mountains some twenty shepherds all clad in sheepskins of black wool
and crowned with garlands which as afterwards appeared were some of
them of yew some of cypress six of the number were carrying a bier
covered with a great variety of flowers and branches on seeing which one
of the goatherds said those who come there are the bearers of
chrysostoms body and the foot of that mountain is the place where he
ordered them to bury him they therefore made haste to reach the spot
and did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground
and four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of
a hard rock they greeted each other courteously and then don quixote
and those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier and on it
covered with flowers they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd to
all appearance of one thirty years of age and showing even in death that
in life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing around him on
the bier itself were laid some books and several papers open and folded
and those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave
and all the others who were there preserved a strange silence until one
of those who had borne the body said to another observe carefully
ambrosia if this is the place chrysostom spoke of since you are anxious
that what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with
this is the place answered ambrosia for in it many a time did my poor
friend tell me the story of his hard fortune here it was he told me
that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race and
here too for the first time he declared to her his passion as
honourable as it was devoted and here it was that at last marcela ended
by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched
life to a close here in memory of misfortunes so great he desired to
be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion then turning to don quixote
and the travellers he went on to say that body sirs on which you are
looking with compassionate eyes was the abode of a soul on which heaven
bestowed a vast share of its riches that is the body of chrysostom who
was unrivalled in wit unequalled in courtesy unapproached in gentle
bearing a phoenix in friendship generous without limit grave without
arrogance gay without vulgarity and in short first in all that
constitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune
he loved deeply he was hated he adored he was scorned he wooed a wild
beast he pleaded with marble he pursued the wind he cried to the
wilderness he served ingratitude and for reward was made the prey of
death in the mid course of life cut short by a shepherdess whom he
sought to immortalise in the memory of man as these papers which you see
could fully prove had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire
after having consigned his body to the earth
you would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner
himself said vivaldo for it is neither right nor proper to do the
will of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable it would not have
been reasonable in augustus caesar had he permitted the directions left
by the divine mantuan in his will to be carried into effect so that
senor ambrosia while you consign your friends body to the earth you
should not consign his writings to oblivion for if he gave the order in
bitterness of heart it is not right that you should irrationally obey
it on the contrary by granting life to those papers let the cruelty of
marcela live for ever to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men
to shun and avoid falling into like danger or i and all of us who have
come here know already the story of this your love stricken and
heart broken friend and we know too your friendship and the cause of
his death and the directions he gave at the close of his life from
which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of marcela the
love of chrysostom and the loyalty of your friendship together with the
end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens
to their eyes last night we learned the death of chrysostom and that he
was to be buried here and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct
road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of
had so moved our compassion and in consideration of that compassion and
our desire to prove it if we might by condolence we beg of you
excellent ambrosia or at least i on my own account entreat you that
instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them
and without waiting for the shepherds answer he stretched out his hand
and took up some of those that were nearest to him seeing which ambrosio
said out of courtesy senor i will grant your request as to those you
have taken but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the
vivaldo who was eager to see what the papers contained opened one of
them at once and saw that its title was lay of despair
ambrosio hearing it said that is the last paper the unhappy man wrote
and that you may see senor to what an end his misfortunes brought him
read it so that you may be heard for you will have time enough for that
while we are waiting for the grave to be dug
i will do so very willingly said vivaldo and as all the bystanders
were equally eager they gathered round him and he reading in a loud
wherein are inserted the despairing verses of the dead shepherd together
from tongue to tongue from land to land proclaimed
the very hell will i constrain to lend
this stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe
and as i strive to body forth the tale
of all i suffer all that thou hast done
forth shall the dread voice roll and bear along
shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain
but to a discord wrung by mad despair
to ease my heart and plant a sting in thine
the lions roar the fierce wolfs savage howl
the crows ill boding croak the hollow moan
of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea
the envied owls sad note the wail of woe
that rises from the dreary choir of hell
let all these come to aid my souls complaint
for pain like mine demands new modes of song
no echoes of that discord shall be heard
where father tagus rolls or on the banks
or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told
and by a lifeless tongue in living words
or in dark valleys or on lonely shores
where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls
the hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound
shall carry them to all the spacious world
disdain hath power to kill and patience dies
slain by suspicion be it false or true
long absence makes of life a dreary void
to him that ever fears to be forgot
but i by some strange miracle live on
and while i suffer thus there comes no ray
of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom
nor do i look for it in my despair
can there be hope where fear is were it well
when far more certain are the grounds of fear
ought i to shut mine eyes to jealousy
if through a thousand heart wounds it appears
who would not give free access to distrust
and the fair truth transformed into a lie
oh thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love
and bind me with thy strongest cord disdain
and now i die and since there is no hope
of happiness for me in life or death
ill say that he is wise who loveth well
and that the soul most free is that most bound
ill say that she who is mine enemy
in that fair body hath as fair a mind
and that her coldness is but my desert
and that by virtue of the pain he sends
love rules his kingdom with a gentle sway
and wearing out the wretched shred of life
to which i am reduced by her disdain
ill give this soul and body to the winds
all hopeless of a crown of bliss in store
that makes me quit the weary life i loathe
as by this wounded bosom thou canst see
let not my death if haply worth a tear
cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes
i would not have thee expiate in aught
the crime of having made my heart thy prey
and prove my death to be thy festival
fool that i am to bid thee well i know
and now it is the time from hells abyss
and come the sisters of the ceaseless toil
and all into this breast transfer their pains
and if such tribute to despair be due
chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge
let the three headed guardian of the gate
lay of despair grieve not when thou art gone
brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth
the lay of chrysostom met with the approbation of the listeners though
the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of
marcelas reserve and propriety for chrysostom complained in it of
jealousy suspicion and absence all to the prejudice of the good name
and fame of marcela to which ambrosio replied as one who knew well his
friends most secret thoughts senor to remove that doubt i should tell
you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from marcela
from whom he had voluntarily separated himself to try if absence would
act with him as it is wont and as everything distresses and every fear
haunts the banished lover so imaginary jealousies and suspicions
dreaded as if they were true tormented chrysostom and thus the truth of
what report declares of the virtue of marcela remains unshaken and with
her envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being
that is true said vivaldo and as he was about to read another paper
of those he had preserved from the fire he was stopped by a marvellous
vision for such it seemed that unexpectedly presented itself to their
eyes for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave
there appeared the shepherdess marcela so beautiful that her beauty
exceeded its reputation those who had never till then beheld her gazed
upon her in wonder and silence and those who were accustomed to see her
were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before but the
instant ambrosio saw her he addressed her with manifest indignation
art thou come by chance cruel basilisk of these mountains to see if
in thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being
thy cruelty has robbed of life or is it to exult over the cruel work of
thy humours that thou art come or like another pitiless nero to look
down from that height upon the ruin of his rome in embers or in thy
arrogance to trample on this ill fated corpse as the ungrateful daughter
trampled on her father tarquins tell us quickly for what thou art come
or what it is thou wouldst have for as i know the thoughts of
chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life i will make all these who
call themselves his friends obey thee though he be dead
i come not ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named replied
marcela but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all
those who blame me for their sorrow and for chrysostoms death and
therefore i ask all of you that are here to give me your attention for
will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons
of sense heaven has made me so you say beautiful and so much so that
in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me and for the love
you show me you say and even urge that i am bound to love you by that
natural understanding which god has given me i know that everything
beautiful attracts love but i cannot see how by reason of being loved
that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it
besides it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be
ugly and ugliness being detestable it is very absurd to say i love
thee because thou art beautiful thou must love me though i be ugly but
supposing the beauty equal on both sides it does not follow that the
inclinations must be therefore alike for it is not every beauty that
excites love some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection
and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart the will
would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any for as
there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of
inclinations and true love i have heard it said is indivisible and
must be voluntary and not compelled if this be so as i believe it to
be why do you desire me to bend my will by force for no other reason
but that you say you love me nay tell me had heaven made me ugly as it
has made me beautiful could i with justice complain of you for not
loving me moreover you must remember that the beauty i possess was no
choice of mine for be it what it may heaven of its bounty gave it me
without my asking or choosing it and as the viper though it kills with
it does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries as it is a
gift of nature neither do i deserve reproach for being beautiful for
beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword the
one does not burn the other does not cut those who do not come too
near honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind without which the
body though it be so has no right to pass for beautiful but if modesty
is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and
body why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify
one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to
rob her of it i was born free and that i might live in freedom i chose
the solitude of the fields in the trees of the mountains i find society
the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors and to the trees and
waters i make known my thoughts and charms i am a fire afar off a sword
laid aside those whom i have inspired with love by letting them see me
i have by words undeceived and if their longings live on hope and i
have given none to chrysostom or to any other it cannot justly be said
that the death of any is my doing for it was rather his own obstinacy
than my cruelty that killed him and if it be made a charge against me
that his wishes were honourable and that therefore i was bound to yield
to them i answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made
he declared to me his purity of purpose i told him that mine was to live
in perpetual solitude and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits
of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty and if after this open
avowal he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind what
wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation if i
had encouraged him i should be false if i had gratified him i should
have acted against my own better resolution and purpose he was
persistent in spite of warning he despaired without being hated bethink
you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my
charge let him who has been deceived complain let him give way to
despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain let him flatter himself
whom i shall entice let him boast whom i shall receive but let not him
call me cruel or homicide to whom i make no promise upon whom i practise
no deception whom i neither entice nor receive it has not been so far
the will of heaven that i should love by fate and to expect me to love
by choice is idle let this general declaration serve for each of my
suitors on his own account and let it be understood from this time forth
that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he dies for
she who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any and candour
is not to be confounded with scorn let him who calls me wild beast and
basilisk leave me alone as something noxious and evil let him who calls
me ungrateful withhold his service who calls me wayward seek not my
acquaintance who calls me cruel pursue me not for this wild beast
this basilisk this ungrateful cruel wayward being has no kind of
desire to seek serve know or follow them if chrysostoms impatience
and violent passion killed him why should my modest behaviour and
circumspection be blamed if i preserve my purity in the society of the
trees why should he who would have me preserve it among men seek to rob
me of it i have as you know wealth of my own and i covet not that of
others my taste is for freedom and i have no relish for constraint i
neither love nor hate anyone i do not deceive this one or court that or
trifle with one or play with another the modest converse of the shepherd
girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations my
desires are bounded by these mountains and if they ever wander hence it
is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens steps by which the soul
with these words and not waiting to hear a reply she turned and passed
into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by leaving all who were
there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty
some those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright
eyes made as though they would follow her heedless of the frank
declaration they had heard seeing which and deeming this a fitting
occasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels
don quixote laying his hand on the hilt of his sword exclaimed in a
let no one whatever his rank or condition dare to follow the beautiful
marcela under pain of incurring my fierce indignation she has shown by
clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found
with her for the death of chrysostom and also how far she is from
yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers for which reason instead of
being followed and persecuted she should in justice be honoured and
esteemed by all the good people of the world for she shows that she is
the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution
whether it was because of the threats of don quixote or because ambrosio
told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend none of the
shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until having finished the grave
and burned chrysostoms papers they laid his body in it not without
many tears from those who stood by they closed the grave with a heavy
stone until a slab was ready which ambrosio said he meant to have
prepared with an epitaph which was to be to this effect
they then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches and
all expressing their condolence with his friend ambrosio took their
vivaldo and his companion did the same and don quixote bade farewell to
his hosts and to the travellers who pressed him to come with them to
seville as being such a convenient place for finding adventures for
they presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener
than anywhere else don quixote thanked them for their advice and for the
disposition they showed to do him a favour and said that for the present
he would not and must not go to seville until he had cleared all these
mountains of highwaymen and robbers of whom report said they were full
seeing his good intention the travellers were unwilling to press him
further and once more bidding him farewell they left him and pursued
their journey in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the
story of marcela and chrysostom as well as the madness of don quixote
he on his part resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess marcela and
make offer to her of all the service he could render her but things did
not fall out with him as he expected according to what is related in the
course of this veracious history of which the second part ends here
in which is related the unfortunate adventure that don quixote fell in
with when he fell out with certain heartless yanguesans
the sage cide hamete benengeli relates that as soon as don quixote took
leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of
chrysostom he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
seen the shepherdess marcela enter and after having wandered for more
than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her
they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass beside which
ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there
the hours of the noontide heat which by this time was beginning to come
on oppressively don quixote and sancho dismounted and turning rocinante
and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance they
ransacked the alforjas and without any ceremony very peacefully and
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them
sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble rocinante feeling sure
from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence that
all the mares in the cordova pastures would not lead him into an
impropriety chance however and the devil who is not always asleep so
ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of galician
ponies belonging to certain yanguesan carriers whose way it is to take
their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and
water abound and that where don quixote chanced to be suited the
yanguesans purpose very well it so happened then that rocinante took
a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies and
abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them he without
asking leave of his master got up a briskish little trot and hastened to
make known his wishes to them they however it seemed preferred their
pasture to him and received him with their heels and teeth to such
effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a
saddle to cover him but what must have been worse to him was that the
carriers seeing the violence he was offering to their mares came
running up armed with stakes and so belaboured him that they brought him
by this time don quixote and sancho who had witnessed the drubbing of
rocinante came up panting and said don quixote to sancho
so far as i can see friend sancho these are not knights but base folk
of low birth i mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking
due vengeance for the insult offered to rocinante before our eyes
what the devil vengeance can we take answered sancho if they are
more than twenty and we no more than two or indeed perhaps not more
i count for a hundred replied don quixote and without more words he
drew his sword and attacked the yanguesans and excited and impelled by
the example of his master sancho did the same and to begin with don
quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather
jerkin he wore together with a great portion of his shoulder the
yanguesans seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were
so many betook themselves to their stakes and driving the two into the
middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy in fact at the
second blow they brought sancho to the ground and don quixote fared the
same way all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing and fate
willed it that he should fall at the feet of rocinante who had not yet
risen whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry
then seeing the mischief they had done the yanguesans with all the
haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey leaving the
two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood
sancho was the first to come to and finding himself close to his master
he called to him in a weak and doleful voice senor don quixote ah
what wouldst thou brother sancho answered don quixote in the same
i would like if it were possible answered sancho panza your worship
to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery blas if it be
that you have any to hand there perhaps it will serve for broken bones
if i only had it here wretch that i am what more should we want said
don quixote but i swear to thee sancho panza on the faith of a
knight errant ere two days are over unless fortune orders otherwise i
mean to have it in my possession or my hand will have lost its cunning
but in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our
for myself i must say i cannot guess how many said the battered knight
don quixote but i take all the blame upon myself for i had no business
to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like
myself and so i believe that in punishment for having transgressed the
laws of chivalry the god of battles has permitted this chastisement to be
administered to me for which reason brother sancho it is well thou
shouldst receive a hint on the matter which i am now about to mention to
thee for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us it is at
when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not
to wait till i draw sword against them for i shall not do so at all but
do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy hearts content and if any
knights come to their aid and defence i will take care to defend thee and
assail them with all my might and thou hast already seen by a thousand
signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal
to so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over
but sancho did not so fully approve of his masters admonition as to let
it pass without saying in reply senor i am a man of peace meek and
quiet and i can put up with any affront because i have a wife and
children to support and bring up so let it be likewise a hint to your
worship as it cannot be a mandate that on no account will i draw sword
either against clown or against knight and that here before god i
forgive the insults that have been offered me whether they have been
are or shall be offered me by high or low rich or poor noble or
commoner not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever
to all which his master said in reply i wish i had breath enough to
speak somewhat easily and that the pain i feel on this side would abate
so as to let me explain to thee panza the mistake thou makest come
now sinner suppose the wind of fortune hitherto so adverse should
turn in our favour filling the sails of our desires so that safely and
without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands i have
promised thee how would it be with thee if on winning it i made thee
lord of it why thou wilt make it well nigh impossible through not being
a knight nor having any desire to be one nor possessing the courage nor
the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship for thou must know
that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the
inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that
there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more
and try as they say what chance may do for them so it is essential
that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern
and valour to attack and defend himself whatever may befall him
in what has now befallen us answered sancho id have been well
pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of
but i swear on the faith of a poor man i am more fit for plasters than
for arguments see if your worship can get up and let us help rocinante
though he does not deserve it for he was the main cause of all this
thrashing i never thought it of rocinante for i took him to be a
virtuous person and as quiet as myself after all they say right that it
takes a long time to come to know people and that there is nothing sure
in this life who would have said that after such mighty slashes as your
worship gave that unlucky knight errant there was coming travelling
post and at the very heels of them such a great storm of sticks as has
and yet thine sancho replied don quixote ought to be used to such
squalls but mine reared in soft cloth and fine linen it is plain they
must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap and if it were not that i
imagine why do i say imagine know of a certainty that all these
annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms i
would lay me down here to die of pure vexation
to this the squire replied senor as these mishaps are what one reaps
of chivalry tell me if they happen very often or if they have their own
fixed times for coming to pass because it seems to me that after two
harvests we shall be no good for the third unless god in his infinite
know friend sancho answered don quixote that the life of
knights errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses and neither
more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights errant to
become kings and emperors as experience has shown in the case of many
different knights with whose histories i am thoroughly acquainted and i
could tell thee now if the pain would let me of some who simply by
might of arm have risen to the high stations i have mentioned and those
same both before and after experienced divers misfortunes and miseries
for the valiant amadis of gaul found himself in the power of his mortal
enemy arcalaus the magician who it is positively asserted holding him
captive gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his
horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court and moreover there is
a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the knight
of phoebus being caught in a certain pitfall which opened under his
feet in a certain castle on falling found himself bound hand and foot in
a deep pit underground where they administered to him one of those
things they call clysters of sand and snow water that well nigh
finished him and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by
a sage a great friend of his it would have gone very hard with the poor
knight so i may well suffer in company with such worthy folk for
greater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we
suffer for i would have thee know sancho that wounds caused by any
instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity
and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words if for
instance the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his
hand though it be in fact a piece of wood it cannot be said for that
reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled i say this lest
thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we
have therefore suffered any indignity for the arms those men carried
with which they pounded us were nothing more than their stakes and not
one of them so far as i remember carried rapier sword or dagger
they gave me no time to see that much answered sancho for hardly had
i laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with
their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and
the strength out of my feet stretching me where i now lie and where
thinking of whether all those stake strokes were an indignity or not
gives me no uneasiness which the pain of the blows does for they will
remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders
for all that let me tell thee brother panza said don quixote that
there is no recollection which time does not put an end to and no pain
and what greater misfortune can there be replied panza than the one
that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it if our
mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters it
would not be so bad but i am beginning to think that all the plasters in
a hospital almost wont be enough to put us right
no more of that pluck strength out of weakness sancho as i mean to
do returned don quixote and let us see how rocinante is for it seems
to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of
there is nothing wonderful in that replied sancho since he is a
knight errant too what i wonder at is that my beast should have come off
fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief
to it said don quixote i say so because this little beast may now
supply the want of rocinante carrying me hence to some castle where i
may be cured of my wounds and moreover i shall not hold it any dishonour
to be so mounted for i remember having read how the good old silenus
the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter when he entered the
city of the hundred gates went very contentedly mounted on a handsome
it may be true that he went mounted as your worship says answered
sancho but there is a great difference between going mounted and going
to which don quixote replied wounds received in battle confer honour
instead of taking it away and so friend panza say no more but as i
told thee before get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best and let us go hence ere
night come on and surprise us in these wilds
and yet i have heard your worship say observed panza that it is very
meet for knights errant to sleep in wastes and deserts and that they
that is said don quixote when they cannot help it or when they are
in love and so true is this that there have been knights who have
remained two years on rocks in sunshine and shade and all the
inclemencies of heaven without their ladies knowing anything of it and
one of these was amadis when under the name of beltenebros he took up
his abode on the pena pobre for i know not if it was eight years or
eight months for i am not very sure of the reckoning at any rate he
stayed there doing penance for i know not what pique the princess oriana
had against him but no more of this now sancho and make haste before a
the very devil would be in it in that case said sancho and letting
off thirty ohs and sixty sighs and a hundred and twenty maledictions
and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there he
raised himself stopping half way bent like a turkish bow without power
to bring himself upright but with all his pains he saddled his ass who
too had gone astray somewhat yielding to the excessive licence of the
day he next raised up rocinante and as for him had he possessed a
tongue to complain with most assuredly neither sancho nor his master
to be brief sancho fixed don quixote on the ass and secured rocinante
with a leading rein and taking the ass by the halter he proceeded more
or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might
be and as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to
better he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight and
on it he perceived an inn which to his annoyance and to the delight of
don quixote must needs be a castle sancho insisted that it was an inn
and his master that it was not one but a castle and the dispute lasted
so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it and
into it sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy
of what happened to the ingenious gentleman in the inn which he took to
the innkeeper seeing don quixote slung across the ass asked sancho what
was amiss with him sancho answered that it was nothing only that he had
fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised the innkeeper
had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling
commonly have for she was by nature kind hearted and felt for the
sufferings of her neighbours so she at once set about tending don
quixote and made her young daughter a very comely girl help her in
taking care of her guest there was besides in the inn as servant an
asturian lass with a broad face flat poll and snub nose blind of one
eye and not very sound in the other the elegance of her shape to be
sure made up for all her defects she did not measure seven palms from
head to foot and her shoulders which overweighted her somewhat made
her contemplate the ground more than she liked this graceful lass then
helped the young girl and the two made up a very bad bed for don quixote
in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many
years as a straw loft in which there was also quartered a carrier whose
bed was placed a little beyond our don quixotes and though only made
of the pack saddles and cloths of his mules had much the advantage of
it as don quixotes consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles a mattress that for thinness might have passed for a
quilt full of pellets which were they not seen through the rents to be
wool would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness two sheets made
of buckler leather and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose
might have counted without missing one in the reckoning
on this accursed bed don quixote stretched himself and the hostess and
her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe while
maritornes for that was the name of the asturian held the light for
them and while plastering him the hostess observing how full of wheals
don quixote was in some places remarked that this had more the look of
it was not blows sancho said but that the rock had many points and
projections and that each of them had left its mark pray senora he
added manage to save some tow as there will be no want of some one to
use it for my loins too are rather sore
then you must have fallen too said the hostess
i did not fall said sancho panza but from the shock i got at seeing
my master fall my body aches so that i feel as if i had had a thousand
that may well be said the young girl for it has many a time happened
to me to dream that i was falling down from a tower and never coming to
the ground and when i awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and
there is the point senora replied sancho panza that i without
dreaming at all but being more awake than i am now find myself with
scarcely less wheals than my master don quixote
how is the gentleman called asked maritornes the asturian
don quixote of la mancha answered sancho panza and he is a
knight adventurer and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen
what is a knight adventurer said the lass
are you so new in the world as not to know answered sancho panza
well then you must know sister that a knight adventurer is a thing
that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor that is to day the most
miserable and needy being in the world and to morrow will have two or
three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire
then how is it said the hostess that belonging to so good a master
as this you have not to judge by appearances even so much as a
it is too soon yet answered sancho for we have only been a month
going in quest of adventures and so far we have met with nothing that
can be called one for it will happen that when one thing is looked for
another thing is found however if my master don quixote gets well of
this wound or fall and i am left none the worse of it i would not
change my hopes for the best title in spain
to all this conversation don quixote was listening very attentively and
sitting up in bed as well as he could and taking the hostess by the hand
he said to her believe me fair lady you may call yourself fortunate
in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person which is such that
if i do not myself praise it it is because of what is commonly said
that self praise debaseth but my squire will inform you who i am i only
tell you that i shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the
service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while
life shall last me and would to heaven love held me not so enthralled
and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom i name
between my teeth but that those of this lovely damsel might be the
the hostess her daughter and the worthy maritornes listened in
bewilderment to the words of the knight errant for they understood about
as much of them as if he had been talking greek though they could
perceive they were all meant for expressions of good will and
blandishments and not being accustomed to this kind of language they
stared at him and wondered to themselves for he seemed to them a man of
a different sort from those they were used to and thanking him in
pothouse phrase for his civility they left him while the asturian gave
her attention to sancho who needed it no less than his master
the carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night
and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the
family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes
unreservedly and it is said of this good lass that she never made
promises of the kind without fulfilling them even though she made them
in a forest and without any witness present for she plumed herself
greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an
employment as servant in an inn because she said misfortunes and
ill luck had brought her to that position the hard narrow wretched
rickety bed of don quixote stood first in the middle of this star lit
stable and close beside it sancho made his which merely consisted of a
rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas
rather than of wool next to these two beds was that of the carrier made
up as has been said of the pack saddles and all the trappings of the
two best mules he had though there were twelve of them sleek plump
and in prime condition for he was one of the rich carriers of arevalo
according to the author of this history who particularly mentions this
carrier because he knew him very well and they even say was in some
degree a relation of his besides which cide hamete benengeli was a
historian of great research and accuracy in all things as is very
evident since he would not pass over in silence those that have been
already mentioned however trifling and insignificant they might be an
example that might be followed by those grave historians who relate
transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them
all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from
carelessness perverseness or ignorance a thousand blessings on the
author of tablante de ricamonte and that of the other book in which the
deeds of the conde tomillas are recounted with what minuteness they
to proceed then after having paid a visit to his team and given them
their second feed the carrier stretched himself on his pack saddles and
lay waiting for his conscientious maritornes sancho was by this time
plastered and had lain down and though he strove to sleep the pain of
his ribs would not let him while don quixote with the pain of his had
his eyes as wide open as a hares
the inn was all in silence and in the whole of it there was no light
except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the
gateway this strange stillness and the thoughts always present to our
knights mind of the incidents described at every turn in the books that
were the cause of his misfortune conjured up to his imagination as
extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived which was that he
fancied himself to have reached a famous castle for as has been said
all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes and that the
daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle and
that she won by his high bred bearing had fallen in love with him and
had promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the
knowledge of her parents and holding all this fantasy that he had
constructed as solid fact he began to feel uneasy and to consider the
perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter and he resolved in
his heart to commit no treason to his lady dulcinea del toboso even
though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present
while he was taken up with these vagaries then the time and the
hour an unlucky one for him arrived for the asturian to come who in
her smock with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif with
noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were
quartered in quest of the carrier but scarcely had she gained the door
when don quixote perceived her and sitting up in his bed in spite of his
plasters and the pain of his ribs he stretched out his arms to receive
his beauteous damsel the asturian who went all doubled up and in
silence with her hands before her feeling for her lover encountered the
arms of don quixote who grasped her tightly by the wrist and drawing
her towards him while she dared not utter a word made her sit down on
the bed he then felt her smock and although it was of sackcloth it
appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk on her wrists she
wore some glass beads but to him they had the sheen of precious orient
pearls her hair which in some measure resembled a horses mane he
rated as threads of the brightest gold of araby whose refulgence dimmed
the sun himself her breath which no doubt smelt of yesterdays stale
salad seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her
mouth and in short he drew her portrait in his imagination with the
same features and in the same style as that which he had seen in his
books of the other princesses who smitten by love came with all the
adornments that are here set down to see the sorely wounded knight and
so great was the poor gentlemans blindness that neither touch nor
smell nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any but
a carrier vomit were enough to undeceive him on the contrary he was
persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms and holding her
firmly in his grasp he went on to say in low tender voice
would that found myself lovely and exalted lady in a position to repay
