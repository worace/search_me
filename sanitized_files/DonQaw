house and explain my intentions to your teresa and if she likes and you
like to be on reward with me bene quidem if not we remain friends for
if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and
bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and
a good grievance better than a bad compensation i speak in this way
sancho to show you that i can shower down proverbs just as well as
yourself and in short i mean to say and i do say that if you dont
like to come on reward with me and run the same chance that i run god
be with you and make a saint of you for i shall find plenty of squires
more obedient and painstaking and not so thickheaded or talkative as you
when sancho heard his masters firm resolute language a cloud came over
the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped for he had made sure
that his master would not go without him for all the wealth of the world
and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody samson carrasco came in
with the housekeeper and niece who were anxious to hear by what
arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seek
adventures the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had
done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o
shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation may god
almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons who
would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the
labyrinth of their schemes nor ever accomplish what they most desire
and then turning to the housekeeper he said mistress housekeeper may
just as well give over saying the prayer of santa apollonia for i know
it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote
shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i
should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade
this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his
valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is
defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs of the protection of
orphans of the honour of virgins of the aid of widows and of the
support of wives and other matters of this kind appertaining belonging
proper and peculiar to the order of knight errantry on then my lord
don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out
to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution
of your purpose here am i ready in person and purse to supply the want
and were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire i should
at this don quixote turning to sancho said did i not tell thee
sancho there would be squires enough and to spare for me see now who
offers to become one no less than the illustrious bachelor samson
carrasco the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the salamancan
schools sound in body discreet patient under heat or cold hunger or
thirst with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errants
squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should
shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences and
cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts let this new
samson remain in his own country and bringing honour to it bring
honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents for i
will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not
i do deign said sancho deeply moved and with tears in his eyes it
shall not be said of me master mine he continued the bread eaten
and the company dispersed nay i come of no ungrateful stock for all
the world knows but particularly my own town who the panzas from whom i
am descended were and what is more i know and have learned by many
good words and deeds your worships desire to show me favour and if i
have been bargaining more or less about my wages it was only to please
my wife who when she sets herself to press a point no hammer drives
the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after
all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow
which i cant deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take
it amiss and so theres nothing more to do but for your worship to make
your will with its codicil in such a way that it cant be provoked and
let us set out at once to save senor samsons soul from suffering as he
says his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out
upon the world a third time so i offer again to serve your worship
faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that
served knights errant in times past or present
the bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard sanchos phraseology
and style of talk for though he had read the first part of his masters
history he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there
described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could
not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be
revoked he believed all he had read of him and set him down as one of
the greatest simpletons of modern times and he said to himself that two
such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen in fine don
quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the
advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now their
oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days
thence by which time they could have all that was requisite for the
journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he
must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of
his who had it would not refuse it to him though it was more dingy with
rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel
the curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor
were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in
the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion they raised a
lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle as if it had
been his death samsons intention in persuading him to sally forth once
more was to do what the history relates farther on all by the advice of
the curate and barber with whom he had previously discussed the subject
finally then during those three days don quixote and sancho provided
themselves with what they considered necessary and sancho having
pacified his wife and don quixote his niece and housekeeper at
nightfall unseen by anyone except the bachelor who thought fit to
accompany them half a league out of the village they set out for el
toboso don quixote on his good rocinante and sancho on his old dapple
his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and
his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies
samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or
evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with
him over the latter as the laws of friendship required don quixote
promised him he would do so and samson returned to the village and the
other two took the road for the great city of el toboso
wherein is related what befell don quixote on his way to see his lady
blessed be allah the all powerful says hamete benengeli on beginning
this eighth chapter blessed be allah he repeats three times and he
says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has now got don
quixote and sancho fairly afield and that the readers of his delightful
history may reckon that the achievements and humours of don quixote and
his squire are now about to begin and he urges them to forget the former
chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on those that
are to come which now begin on the road to el toboso as the others
began on the plains of montiel nor is it much that he asks in
consideration of all he promises and so he goes on to say
don quixote and sancho were left alone and the moment samson took his
departure rocinante began to neigh and dapple to sigh which by both
knight and squire was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen
though if the truth is to be told the sighs and brays of dapple were
louder than the neighings of the hack from which sancho inferred that
his good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master building
perhaps upon some judicial astrology that he may have known though the
history says nothing about it all that can be said is that when he
stumbled or fell he was heard to say he wished he had not come out for
by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or
a broken rib and fool as he was he was not much astray in this
said don quixote sancho my friend night is drawing on upon us as we
go and more darkly than will allow us to reach el toboso by daylight
for there i am resolved to go before i engage in another adventure and
there i shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless
dulcinea with which permission i expect and feel assured that i shall
conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure for
nothing in life makes knights errant more valorous than finding
so i believe replied sancho but i think it will be difficult for
your worship to speak with her or see her at any rate where you will be
able to receive her blessing unless indeed she throws it over the wall
of the yard where i saw her the time before when i took her the letter
that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing in the
didst thou take that for a yard wall sancho said don quixote where
or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and
beauty it must have been the gallery corridor or portico of some rich
it might have been all that returned sancho but to me it looked like
a wall unless i am short of memory
at all events let us go there sancho said don quixote for so that
i see her it is the same to me whether it be over a wall or at a
window or through the chink of a door or the grate of a garden for any
beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my
reason and strength to my heart so that i shall be unmatched and
well to tell the truth senor said sancho when i saw that sun of
the lady dulcinea del toboso it was not bright enough to throw out beams
at all it must have been that as her grace was sifting that wheat i
told you of the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud
what dost thou still persist sancho said don quixote in saying
thinking believing and maintaining that my lady dulcinea was sifting
wheat that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what
is and should be the employment of persons of distinction who are
constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show
their rank a bowshot off thou hast forgotten o sancho those lines of
our poet wherein he paints for us how in their crystal abodes those
four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved tagus and
seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which
the ingenious poet there describes to us how they were worked and woven
with gold and silk and pearls and something of this sort must have been
the employment of my lady when thou sawest her only that the spite which
some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes
all those things that give me pleasure and turns them into shapes unlike
their own and so i fear that in that history of my achievements which
they say is now in print if haply its author was some sage who is an
enemy of mine he will have put one thing for another mingling a
thousand lies with one truth and amusing himself by relating
transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true
history o envy root of all countless evils and cankerworm of the
virtues all the vices sancho bring some kind of pleasure with them
but envy brings nothing but irritation bitterness and rage
so i say too replied sancho and i suspect in that legend or history
of us that the bachelor samson carrasco told us he saw my honour goes
dragged in the dirt knocked about up and down sweeping the streets as
they say and yet on the faith of an honest man i never spoke ill of
any enchanter and i am not so well off that i am to be envied to be
sure i am rather sly and i have a certain spice of the rogue in me but
all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity always natural and
never acted and if i had no other merit save that i believe as i always
do firmly and truly in god and all the holy roman catholic church holds
and believes and that i am a mortal enemy of the jews the historians
ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings but let
them say what they like naked was i born naked i find myself i neither
lose nor gain nay while i see myself put into a book and passed on from
hand to hand over the world i dont care a fig let them say what they
that sancho returned don quixote reminds me of what happened to a
famous poet of our own day who having written a bitter satire against
all the courtesan ladies did not insert or name in it a certain lady of
whom it was questionable whether she was one or not she seeing she was
not in the list of the poet asked him what he had seen in her that he
did not include her in the number of the others telling him he must add
to his satire and put her in the new part or else look out for the
consequences the poet did as she bade him and left her without a shred
of reputation and she was satisfied by getting fame though it was
infamy in keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set
fire to the famous temple of diana by repute one of the seven wonders of
the world and burned it with the sole object of making his name live in
after ages and though it was forbidden to name him or mention his name
by word of mouth or in writing lest the object of his ambition should be
attained nevertheless it became known that he was called erostratus and
something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great
emperor charles v and a gentleman in rome the emperor was anxious to see
that famous temple of the rotunda called in ancient times the temple of
all the gods but now a days by a better nomenclature of all the
saints which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan
construction in rome and the one which best sustains the reputation of
mighty works and magnificence of its founders it is in the form of a
half orange of enormous dimensions and well lighted though no light
penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window or rather round
skylight at the top and it was from this that the emperor examined the
building a roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the
skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful
architecture and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor
a thousand times your sacred majesty the impulse came upon me to seize
your majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight so as
to leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever i am
thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect said
the emperor and i shall give you no opportunity in future of again
putting your loyalty to the test and i therefore forbid you ever to
speak to me or to be where i am and he followed up these words by
bestowing a liberal bounty upon him my meaning is sancho that the
desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive what thinkest thou
was it that flung horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the
depths of the tiber what burned the hand and arm of mutius what
impelled curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened in the
midst of rome what in opposition to all the omens that declared against
him made julius caesar cross the rubicon and to come to more modern
examples what scuttled the ships and left stranded and cut off the
gallant spaniards under the command of the most courteous cortes in the
new world all these and a variety of other great exploits are were and
will be the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion
of the immortality their famous deeds deserve though we catholic
christians and knights errant look more to that future glory that is
everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to the vanity of the
fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life a fame that
however long it may last must after all end with the world itself which
has its own appointed end so that o sancho in what we do we must not
overpass the bounds which the christian religion we profess has assigned
to us we have to slay pride in giants envy by generosity and nobleness
of heart anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity gluttony and
sloth by the spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils lust and
lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the
mistresses of our thoughts indolence by traversing the world in all
directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves besides christians
famous knights such sancho are the means by which we reach those
extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it
all that your worship has said so far said sancho i have understood
quite well but still i would be glad if your worship would dissolve a
doubt for me which has just this minute come into my mind
solve thou meanest sancho said don quixote say on in gods name
and i will answer as well as i can
tell me senor sancho went on to say those julys or augusts and all
those venturous knights that you say are now dead where are they now
the heathens replied don quixote are no doubt in hell the
christians if they were good christians are either in purgatory or in
very good said sancho but now i want to know the tombs where the
bodies of those great lords are have they silver lamps before them or
are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches winding sheets
tresses of hair legs and eyes in wax or what are they ornamented with
to which don quixote made answer the tombs of the heathens were
generally sumptuous temples the ashes of julius caesars body were
placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size which they now call in
rome saint peters needle the emperor hadrian had for a tomb a castle as
large as a good sized village which they called the moles adriani and
is now the castle of st angelo in rome the queen artemisia buried her
husband mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of
the world but none of these tombs or of the many others of the
heathens were ornamented with winding sheets or any of those other
offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are
thats the point im coming to said sancho and now tell me which is
the greater work to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant
the answer is easy replied don quixote it is a greater work to bring
now i have got you said sancho in that case the fame of them who
bring the dead to life who give sight to the blind cure cripples
restore health to the sick and before whose tombs there are lamps
burning and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees
adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other than
that which all the heathen emperors and knights errant that have ever
been in the world have left or may leave behind them
then this fame these favours these privileges or whatever you call
it said sancho belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who
with the approbation and permission of our holy mother church have
lamps tapers winding sheets crutches pictures eyes and legs by
means of which they increase devotion and add to their own christian
reputation kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their
shoulders and kiss bits of their bones and enrich and adorn their
what wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said sancho asked
my meaning is said sancho let us set about becoming saints and we
shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after for you
know senor yesterday or the day before yesterday for it is so lately
one may say so they canonised and beatified two little barefoot friars
and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch the iron
chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies and they are held
in greater veneration so it is said than the sword of roland in the
armoury of our lord the king whom god preserve so that senor it is
better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order than a
valiant knight errant with god a couple of dozen of penance lashings are
of more avail than two thousand lance thrusts be they given to giants
all that is true returned don quixote but we cannot all be friars
and many are the ways by which god takes his own to heaven chivalry is a
yes said sancho but i have heard say that there are more friars in
that said don quixote is because those in religious orders are more
many replied don quixote but few they who deserve the name of
with these and other discussions of the same sort they passed that
night and the following day without anything worth mention happening to
them whereat don quixote was not a little dejected but at length the
next day at daybreak they descried the great city of el toboso at the
sight of which don quixotes spirits rose and sanchos fell for he did
not know dulcineas house nor in all his life had he ever seen her any
more than his master so that they were both uneasy the one to see her
the other at not having seen her and sancho was at a loss to know what
he was to do when his master sent him to el toboso in the end don
quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall and they waited
until the time came among some oak trees that were near el toboso and
when the moment they had agreed upon arrived they made their entrance
into the city where something happened them that may fairly be called
wherein is related what will be seen there
twas at the very midnight hour more or less when don quixote and
sancho quitted the wood and entered el toboso the town was in deep
silence for all the inhabitants were asleep and stretched on the broad
of their backs as the saying is the night was darkish though sancho
would have been glad had it been quite dark so as to find in the
darkness an excuse for his blundering all over the place nothing was to
be heard except the barking of dogs which deafened the ears of don
quixote and troubled the heart of sancho now and then an ass brayed
pigs grunted cats mewed and the various noises they made seemed louder
in the silence of the night all which the enamoured knight took to be of
evil omen nevertheless he said to sancho sancho my son lead on to
the palace of dulcinea it may be that we shall find her awake
body of the sun what palace am i to lead to said sancho when what i
saw her highness in was only a very little house
most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her
palace said don quixote to amuse herself with damsels as great
senor said sancho if your worship will have it in spite of me that
the house of my lady dulcinea is a palace is this an hour think you to
find the door open and will it be right for us to go knocking till they
hear us and open the door making a disturbance and confusion all through
the household are we going do you fancy to the house of our wenches
like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour however late it
let us first of all find out the palace for certain replied don
quixote and then i will tell thee sancho what we had best do but
look sancho for either i see badly or that dark mass that one sees
then let your worship lead the way said sancho perhaps it may be so
though i see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands ill believe it
as much as i believe it is daylight now
don quixote took the lead and having gone a matter of two hundred paces
he came upon the mass that produced the shade and found it was a great
tower and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace
but the chief church of the town and said he its the church we have
so i see said sancho and god grant we may not light upon our graves
it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time
of night and that after my telling your worship if i dont mistake
that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet
the curse of god on thee for a blockhead said don quixote where hast
thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys
senor replied sancho every country has a way of its own perhaps
here in el toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in
alleys so i entreat your worship to let me search about among these
streets or alleys before me and perhaps in some corner or other i may
stumble on this palace and i wish i saw the dogs eating it for leading
speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady sancho said don
quixote let us keep the feast in peace and not throw the rope after
ill hold my tongue said sancho but how am i to take it patiently
when your worship wants me with only once seeing the house of our
mistress to know always and find it in the middle of the night when
your worship cant find it who must have seen it thousands of times
thou wilt drive me to desperation sancho said don quixote look
here heretic have i not told thee a thousand times that i have never
once in my life seen the peerless dulcinea or crossed the threshold of
her palace and that i am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great
i hear it now returned sancho and i may tell you that if you have
that cannot be said don quixote for at any rate thou saidst on
bringing back the answer to the letter i sent by thee that thou sawest
dont mind that senor said sancho i must tell you that my seeing
her and the answer i brought you back were by hearsay too for i can no
more tell who the lady dulcinea is than i can hit the sky
sancho sancho said don quixote there are times for jests and times
when jests are out of place if i tell thee that i have neither seen nor
spoken to the lady of my heart it is no reason why thou shouldst say
thou hast not spoken to her or seen her when the contrary is the case
while the two were engaged in this conversation they perceived some one
with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood and from the
noise the plough made as it dragged along the ground they guessed him
to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work and
so it proved to be he came along singing the ballad that says
ill did ye fare ye men of france in roncesvalles chase
may i die sancho said don quixote when he heard him if any good
will come to us tonight dost thou not hear what that clown is singing
i do said sancho but what has roncesvalles chase to do with what we
have in hand he might just as well be singing the ballad of calainos
for any good or ill that can come to us in our business
by this time the labourer had come up and don quixote asked him can
you tell me worthy friend and god speed you whereabouts here is the
palace of the peerless princess dona dulcinea del toboso
senor replied the lad i am a stranger and i have been only a few
days in the town doing farm work for a rich farmer in that house
opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan and both
or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this
lady princess for they have a list of all the people of el toboso
though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it
many ladies there are of quality and in her own house each of them may
well then she i am inquiring for will be one of these my friend
may be so replied the lad god be with you for here comes the
daylight and without waiting for any more of his questions he whipped
sancho seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied said to
him senor daylight will be here before long and it will not do for us
to let the sun find us in the street it will be better for us to quit
the city and for your worship to hide in some forest in the
neighbourhood and i will come back in the daytime and i wont leave a
nook or corner of the whole village that i wont search for the house
castle or palace of my lady and it will be hard luck for me if i dont
find it and as soon as i have found it i will speak to her grace and
tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some
plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation
sancho said don quixote thou hast delivered a thousand sentences
condensed in the compass of a few words i thank thee for the advice thou
hast given me and take it most gladly come my son let us go look for
some place where i may hide while thou dost return as thou sayest to
seek and speak with my lady from whose discretion and courtesy i look
sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town lest he should
discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the sierra
morena on behalf of dulcinea so he hastened their departure which they
took at once and two miles out of the village they found a forest or
thicket wherein don quixote ensconced himself while sancho returned to
the city to speak to dulcinea in which embassy things befell him which
wherein is related the crafty device sancho adopted to enchant the lady
dulcinea and other incidents as ludicrous as they are true
when the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down in
this chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in silence
fearing it would not be believed because here don quixotes madness
reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived and even goes
a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest but after all though still
under the same fear and apprehension he has recorded it without adding
to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth and entirely
disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him
and he was right for the truth may run fine but will not break and
always rises above falsehood as oil above water and so going on with
his story he says that as soon as don quixote had ensconced himself in
the forest oak grove or wood near el toboso he bade sancho return to
the city and not come into his presence again without having first
spoken on his behalf to his lady and begged of her that it might be her
good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight and
deign to bestow her blessing upon him so that he might thereby hope for
a happy issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises sancho
undertook to execute the task according to the instructions and to bring
back an answer as good as the one he brought back before
go my son said don quixote and be not dazed when thou findest
thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to
seek happy thou above all the squires in the world bear in mind and
let it not escape thy memory how she receives thee if she changes
colour while thou art giving her my message if she is agitated and
disturbed at hearing my name if she cannot rest upon her cushion
shouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper
to her rank and should she be standing observe if she poises herself
now on one foot now on the other if she repeats two or three times the
reply she gives thee if she passes from gentleness to austerity from
asperity to tenderness if she raises her hand to smooth her hair though
it be not disarranged in short my son observe all her actions and
motions for if thou wilt report them to me as they were i will gather
what she hides in the recesses of her heart as regards my love for i
would have thee know sancho if thou knowest it not that with lovers
the outward actions and motions they give way to when their loves are in
question are the faithful messengers that carry the news of what is going
on in the depths of their hearts go my friend may better fortune than
mine attend thee and bring thee a happier issue than that which i await
i will go and return quickly said sancho cheer up that little heart
of yours master mine for at the present moment you seem to have got one
no bigger than a hazel nut remember what they say that a stout heart
breaks bad luck and that where there are no fletches there are no pegs
and moreover they say the hare jumps up where its not looked for i say
this because if we could not find my ladys palaces or castles to night
now that it is daylight i count upon finding them when i least expect it
and once found leave it to me to manage her
verily sancho said don quixote thou dost always bring in thy
proverbs happily whatever we deal with may god give me better luck in
with this sancho wheeled about and gave dapple the stick and don
quixote remained behind seated on his horse resting in his stirrups and
leaning on the end of his lance filled with sad and troubled
forebodings and there we will leave him and accompany sancho who went
off no less serious and troubled than he left his master so much so
that as soon as he had got out of the thicket and looking round saw that
don quixote was not within sight he dismounted from his ass and seating
himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with himself saying
now brother sancho let us know where your worship is going are you
going to look for some ass that has been lost not at all then what are
you going to look for i am going to look for a princess thats all and
in her for the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once and where do
you expect to find all this sancho where why in the great city of el
toboso well and for whom are you going to look for her for the famous
knight don quixote of la mancha who rights wrongs gives food to those
who thirst and drink to the hungry thats all very well but do you know
her house sancho my master says it will be some royal palace or grand
castle and have you ever seen her by any chance neither i nor my master
ever saw her and does it strike you that it would be just and right if
the el toboso people finding out that you were here with the intention
of going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies were
to come and cudgel your ribs and not leave a whole bone in you they
would indeed have very good reason if they did not see that i am under
orders and that you are a messenger my friend no blame belongs to
you dont you trust to that sancho for the manchegan folk are as
hot tempered as they are honest and wont put up with liberties from
anybody by the lord if they get scent of you it will be worse for you
i promise you be off you scoundrel let the bolt fall why should i go
looking for three feet on a cat to please another man and what is more
when looking for dulcinea will be looking for marica in ravena or the
bachelor in salamanca the devil the devil and nobody else has mixed me
such was the soliloquy sancho held with himself and all the conclusion
he could come to was to say to himself again well theres remedy for
everything except death under whose yoke we have all to pass whether we
like it or not when lifes finished i have seen by a thousand signs
that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied and for that matter
i too am not behind him for im a greater fool than he is when i follow
him and serve him if theres any truth in the proverb that says tell
me what company thou keepest and ill tell thee what thou art or in
that other not with whom thou art bred but with whom thou art fed
well then if he be mad as he is and with a madness that mostly takes
one thing for another and white for black and black for white as was
seen when he said the windmills were giants and the monks mules
dromedaries flocks of sheep armies of enemies and much more to the same
tune it will not be very hard to make him believe that some country
girl the first i come across here is the lady dulcinea and if he does
not believe it ill swear it and if he should swear ill swear again
and if he persists ill persist still more so as come what may to have
my quoit always over the peg maybe by holding out in this way i may
put a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time or
maybe he will think as i suspect he will that one of those wicked
enchanters who he says have a spite against him has changed her form
for the sake of doing him an ill turn and injuring him
with this reflection sancho made his mind easy counting the business as
good as settled and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make don
quixote think he had time enough to go to el toboso and return and
things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount dapple
he spied coming from el toboso towards the spot where he stood three
peasant girls on three colts or fillies for the author does not make
the point clear though it is more likely they were she asses the usual
mount with village girls but as it is of no great consequence we need
to be brief the instant sancho saw the peasant girls he returned full
speed to seek his master and found him sighing and uttering a thousand
passionate lamentations when don quixote saw him he exclaimed what
news sancho my friend am i to mark this day with a white stone or a
your worship replied sancho had better mark it with ruddle like the
inscriptions on the walls of class rooms that those who see it may see
then thou bringest good news said don quixote
so good replied sancho that your worship has only to spur rocinante
and get out into the open field to see the lady dulcinea del toboso who
with two others damsels of hers is coming to see your worship
holy god what art thou saying sancho my friend exclaimed don
quixote take care thou art not deceiving me or seeking by false joy to
what could i get by deceiving your worship returned sancho
especially when it will so soon be shown whether i tell the truth or
not come senor push on and you will see the princess our mistress
coming robed and adorned in fact like what she is her damsels and she
are all one glow of gold all bunches of pearls all diamonds all
rubies all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders with their hair
loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind and
moreover they come mounted on three piebald cackneys the finest sight
there is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys said
sancho but no matter what they come on there they are the finest
ladies one could wish for especially my lady the princess dulcinea who
let us go sancho my son said don quixote and in guerdon of this
news as unexpected as it is good i bestow upon thee the best spoil i
shall win in the first adventure i may have or if that does not satisfy
thee i promise thee the foals i shall have this year from my three mares
that thou knowest are in foal on our village common
ill take the foals said sancho for it is not quite certain that the
spoils of the first adventure will be good ones
by this time they had cleared the wood and saw the three village lasses
close at hand don quixote looked all along the road to el toboso and as
he could see nobody except the three peasant girls he was completely
puzzled and asked sancho if it was outside the city he had left them
how outside the city returned sancho are your worships eyes in the
back of your head that you cant see that they are these who are coming
here shining like the very sun at noonday
i see nothing sancho said don quixote but three country girls on
now may god deliver me from the devil said sancho and can it be
that your worship takes three hackneys or whatever theyre called as
white as the driven snow for jackasses by the lord i could tear my
well i can only say sancho my friend said don quixote that it is
as plain they are jackasses or jennyasses as that i am don quixote and
thou sancho panza at any rate they seem to me to be so
hush senor said sancho dont talk that way but open your eyes and
come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts who is close
upon us now and with these words he advanced to receive the three
village lasses and dismounting from dapple caught hold of one of the
asses of the three country girls by the halter and dropping on both
knees on the ground he said queen and princess and duchess of beauty
may it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into your favour
and good will your captive knight who stands there turned into marble
stone and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself in your
magnificent presence i am sancho panza his squire and he the vagabond
knight don quixote of la mancha otherwise called the knight of the
don quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside sancho
and with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze was regarding
her whom sancho called queen and lady and as he could see nothing in her
except a village lass and not a very well favoured one for she was
platter faced and snub nosed he was perplexed and bewildered and did
not venture to open his lips the country girls at the same time were
astonished to see these two men so different in appearance on their
knees preventing their companion from going on she however who had
been stopped breaking silence said angrily and testily get out of the
way bad luck to you and let us pass for we are in a hurry
to which sancho returned oh princess and universal lady of el toboso
is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop of
knight errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence
on hearing this one of the others exclaimed woa then why im rubbing
thee down she ass of my father in law see how the lordlings come to
make game of the village girls now as if we here could not chaff as well
as themselves go your own way and let us go ours and it will be better
get up sancho said don quixote at this i see that fortune with
evil done to me unsated still has taken possession of all the roads by
which any comfort may reach this wretched soul that i carry in my
flesh and thou highest perfection of excellence that can be desired
utmost limit of grace in human shape sole relief of this afflicted heart
that adores thee though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has
brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes and to them and them only
transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of
a poor peasant girl if so be he has not at the same time changed mine
into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight refuse
not to look upon me with tenderness and love seeing in this submission
that i make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the humility with which
hey day my grandfather cried the girl much i care for your
love making get out of the way and let us pass and well thank you
sancho stood aside and let her go very well pleased to have got so well
out of the hobble he was in the instant the village lass who had done
duty for dulcinea found herself free prodding her cackney with a spike
she had at the end of a stick she set off at full speed across the
field the she ass however feeling the point more acutely than usual
began cutting such capers that it flung the lady dulcinea to the ground
seeing which don quixote ran to raise her up and sancho to fix and
girth the pack saddle which also had slipped under the asss belly the
pack saddle being secured as don quixote was about to lift up his
enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast the lady
getting up from the ground saved him the trouble for going back a
little she took a short run and putting both hands on the croup of the
ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon and sat
astride like a man whereat sancho said rogue but our lady is lighter
than a lanner and might teach the cleverest cordovan or mexican how to
mount she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump and without spurs
she is making the hackney go like a zebra and her damsels are no way
behind her for they all fly like the wind which was the truth for as
soon as they saw dulcinea mounted they pushed on after her and sped
away without looking back for more than half a league
don quixote followed them with his eyes and when they were no longer in
sight he turned to sancho and said how now sancho thou seest how i
am hated by enchanters and see to what a length the malice and spite
they bear me go when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it would
give me to see my lady in her own proper form the fact is i was born to
be an example of misfortune and the target and mark at which the arrows
of adversity are aimed and directed observe too sancho that these
traitors were not content with changing and transforming my dulcinea but
they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and ill favoured as
that of the village girl yonder and at the same time they robbed her of
that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of distinction that is
to say the sweet fragrance that comes of being always among perfumes and
flowers for i must tell thee sancho that when i approached to put
dulcinea upon her hackney as thou sayest it was though to me it
appeared a she ass she gave me a whiff of raw garlic that made my head
o scum of the earth cried sancho at this o miserable spiteful
enchanters o that i could see you all strung by the gills like sardines
on a twig ye know a great deal ye can do a great deal and ye do a
great deal more it ought to have been enough for you ye scoundrels to
have changed the pearls of my ladys eyes into oak galls and her hair of
purest gold into the bristles of a red oxs tail and in short all her
features from fair to foul without meddling with her smell for by that
we might somehow have found out what was hidden underneath that ugly
rind though to tell the truth i never perceived her ugliness but only
her beauty which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole
she had on her right lip like a moustache with seven or eight red hairs
like threads of gold and more than a palm long
from the correspondence which exists between those of the face and those
of the body said don quixote dulcinea must have another mole
resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she has
the one on her ace but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are very
well all i can say is there they were as plain as could be replied
i believe it my friend returned don quixote for nature bestowed
nothing on dulcinea that was not perfect and well finished and so if
she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described in her they
would not be moles but moons and shining stars but tell me sancho
that which seemed to me to be a pack saddle as thou wert fixing it was
it a flat saddle or a side saddle
it was neither replied sancho but a jineta saddle with a field
covering worth half a kingdom so rich is it
and that i could not see all this sancho said don quixote once more
i say and will say a thousand times i am the most unfortunate of men
sancho the rogue had enough to do to hide his laughter at hearing the
simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled at length after a
good deal more conversation had passed between them they remounted their
beasts and followed the road to saragossa which they expected to reach
in time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year
in that illustrious city but before they got there things happened to
them so many so important and so strange that they deserve to be
recorded and read as will be seen farther on
of the strange adventure which the valiant don quixote had with the car
dejected beyond measure did don quixote pursue his journey turning over
in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his
lady dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass nor could he think
of any way of restoring her to her original form and these reflections
so absorbed him that without being aware of it he let go rocinantes
bridle and he perceiving the liberty that was granted him stopped at
every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded
sancho recalled him from his reverie melancholy senor said he was
made not for beasts but for men but if men give way to it overmuch
they turn to beasts control yourself your worship be yourself again
gather up rocinantes reins cheer up rouse yourself and show that
gallant spirit that knights errant ought to have what the devil is this
what weakness is this are we here or in france the devil fly away with
all the dulcineas in the world for the well being of a single
knight errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and
hush sancho said don quixote in a weak and faint voice hush and
utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady for i alone am to blame
for her misfortune and hard fate her calamity has come of the hatred the
so say i returned sancho his heart rend in twain i trow who saw
thou mayest well say that sancho replied don quixote as thou sawest
her in the full perfection of her beauty for the enchantment does not go
so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee against
me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed
nevertheless there is one thing which has occurred to me and that is
that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me for as well as i
recollect thou saidst that her eyes were pearls but eyes that are like
pearls are rather the eyes of a sea bream than of a lady and i am
persuaded that dulcineas must be green emeralds full and soft with two
rainbows for eyebrows take away those pearls from her eyes and transfer
them to her teeth for beyond a doubt sancho thou hast taken the one
for the other the eyes for the teeth
very likely said sancho for her beauty bewildered me as much as her
ugliness did your worship but let us leave it all to god who alone
knows what is to happen in this vale of tears in this evil world of
ours where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture of
wickedness roguery and rascality but one thing senor troubles me
more than all the rest and that is thinking what is to be done when your
worship conquers some giant or some other knight and orders him to go
and present himself before the beauty of the lady dulcinea where is this
poor giant or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight to find her i
think i can see them wandering all over el toboso looking like noddies
and asking for my lady dulcinea and even if they meet her in the middle
of the street they wont know her any more than they would my father
perhaps sancho returned don quixote the enchantment does not go so
far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power
of recognising dulcinea we will try by experiment with one or two of the
first i vanquish and send to her whether they see her or not by
commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them
i declare i think what your worship has proposed is excellent said
sancho and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know
and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden the
misfortune will be more yours than hers but so long as the lady dulcinea
is well and happy we on our part will make the best of it and get on as
well as we can seeking our adventures and leaving time to take his own
course for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments
don quixote was about to reply to sancho panza but he was prevented by a
cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages
and figures that could be imagined he who led the mules and acted as
carter was a hideous demon the cart was open to the sky without a tilt
or cane roof and the first figure that presented itself to don quixotes
eyes was that of death itself with a human face next to it was an angel
with large painted wings and at one side an emperor with a crown to
all appearance of gold on his head at the feet of death was the god
called cupid without his bandage but with his bow quiver and arrows
there was also a knight in full armour except that he had no morion or
helmet but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours and along
with these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces all
this unexpectedly encountered took don quixote somewhat aback and
struck terror into the heart of sancho but the next instant don quixote
was glad of it believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting
itself to him and under this impression and with a spirit prepared to
face any danger he planted himself in front of the cart and in a loud
and menacing tone exclaimed carter or coachman or devil or whatever
thou art tell me at once who thou art whither thou art going and who
these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon which looks more like charons
to which the devil stopping the cart answered quietly senor we are
players of angulo el malos company we have been acting the play of the
cortes of death this morning which is the octave of corpus christi in
a village behind that hill and we have to act it this afternoon in that
village which you can see from this and as it is so near and to save
the trouble of undressing and dressing again we go in the costumes in
which we perform that lad there appears as death that other as an
angel that woman the managers wife plays the queen this one the
soldier that the emperor and i the devil and i am one of the principal
characters of the play for in this company i take the leading parts if
you want to know anything more about us ask me and i will answer with
the utmost exactitude for as i am a devil i am up to everything
by the faith of a knight errant replied don quixote when i saw this
cart i fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me but i
declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye if
illusions are to be avoided god speed you good people keep your
festival and remember if you demand of me ought wherein i can render
you a service i will do it gladly and willingly for from a child i was
fond of the play and in my youth a keen lover of the actors art
while they were talking fate so willed it that one of the company in a
mummers dress with a great number of bells and armed with three blown
ox bladders at the end of a stick joined them and this merry andrew
approaching don quixote began flourishing his stick and banging the
ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the
bells which untoward apparition so startled rocinante that in spite of
don quixotes efforts to hold him in taking the bit between his teeth he
set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy
