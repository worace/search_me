into the hurrying carriages then leaning back with a sigh he said
this is the world the notion suddenly seized him to see where the
world was going since many of the richer and brighter seemed hurrying
all one way so when a tall light haired young man and a little
talkative lady came by he rose half hesitatingly and followed them
up the street they went past stores and gay shops across a broad
square until with a hundred others they entered the high portal of a
he was pushed toward the ticket office with the others and felt in his
pocket for the new five dollar bill he had hoarded there seemed
really no time for hesitation so he drew it bravely out passed it to
the busy clerk and received simply a ticket but no change when at
last he realized that he had paid five dollars to enter he knew not
what he stood stockstill amazed be careful said a low voice
behind him you must not lynch the colored gentleman simply because
hes in your way and a girl looked up roguishly into the eyes of her
fair haired escort a shade of annoyance passed over the escorts
face you will not understand us at the south he said half
impatiently as if continuing an argument with all your professions
one never sees in the north so cordial and intimate relations between
white and black as are everyday occurrences with us why i remember
my closest playfellow in boyhood was a little negro named after me and
surely no two well the man stopped short and flushed to the roots
of his hair for there directly beside his reserved orchestra chairs
sat the negro he had stumbled over in the hallway he hesitated and
grew pale with anger called the usher and gave him his card with a
few peremptory words and slowly sat down the lady deftly changed the
all this john did not see for he sat in a half daze minding the scene
about him the delicate beauty of the hall the faint perfume the
moving myriad of men the rich clothing and low hum of talking seemed
all a part of a world so different from his so strangely more
beautiful than anything he had known that he sat in dreamland and
started when after a hush rose high and clear the music of
lohengrins swan the infinite beauty of the wail lingered and swept
through every muscle of his frame and put it all a tune he closed
his eyes and grasped the elbows of the chair touching unwittingly the
ladys arm and the lady drew away a deep longing swelled in all his
heart to rise with that clear music out of the dirt and dust of that
low life that held him prisoned and befouled if he could only live up
in the free air where birds sang and setting suns had no touch of
blood who had called him to be the slave and butt of all and if he
had called what right had he to call when a world like this lay open
then the movement changed and fuller mightier harmony swelled away
he looked thoughtfully across the hall and wondered why the beautiful
gray haired woman looked so listless and what the little man could be
whispering about he would not like to be listless and idle he
thought for he felt with the music the movement of power within him
if he but had some master work some life service hard aye bitter
hard but without the cringing and sickening servility without the
cruel hurt that hardened his heart and soul when at last a soft
sorrow crept across the violins there came to him the vision of a
far off home the great eyes of his sister and the dark drawn face of
his mother and his heart sank below the waters even as the sea sand
sinks by the shores of altamaha only to be lifted aloft again with
that last ethereal wail of the swan that quivered and faded away into
it left john sitting so silent and rapt that he did not for some time
notice the usher tapping him lightly on the shoulder and saying
politely will you step this way please sir a little surprised
he arose quickly at the last tap and turning to leave his seat
looked full into the face of the fair haired young man for the first
time the young man recognized his dark boyhood playmate and john knew
that it was the judges son the white john started lifted his hand
and then froze into his chair the black john smiled lightly then
grimly and followed the usher down the aisle the manager was sorry
very very sorry but he explained that some mistake had been made in
selling the gentleman a seat already disposed of he would refund the
money of course and indeed felt the matter keenly and so forth
and before he had finished john was gone walking hurriedly across the
square and down the broad streets and as he passed the park he
buttoned his coat and said john jones youre a natural born fool
then he went to his lodgings and wrote a letter and tore it up he
wrote another and threw it in the fire then he seized a scrap of
paper and wrote dear mother and sister i am coming john
perhaps said john as he settled himself on the train perhaps i am
to blame myself in struggling against my manifest destiny simply
because it looks hard and unpleasant here is my duty to altamaha
plain before me perhaps theyll let me help settle the negro problems
there perhaps they wont i will go in to the king which is not
according to the law and if i perish i perish and then he mused
and dreamed and planned a life work and the train flew south
down in altamaha after seven long years all the world knew john was
coming the homes were scrubbed and scoured above all one the
gardens and yards had an unwonted trimness and jennie bought a new
gingham with some finesse and negotiation all the dark methodists
and presbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the
baptist church and as the day drew near warm discussions arose on
every corner as to the exact extent and nature of johns
accomplishments it was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he
came the black town flocked to the depot with a little of the white
at the edges a happy throng with good mawnings and howdys and
laughing and joking and jostling mother sat yonder in the window
watching but sister jennie stood on the platform nervously fingering
her dress tall and lithe with soft brown skin and loving eyes peering
from out a tangled wilderness of hair john rose gloomily as the train
stopped for he was thinking of the jim crow car he stepped to the
platform and paused a little dingy station a black crowd gaudy and
dirty a half mile of dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of
mud an overwhelming sense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all
seized him he looked in vain for his mother kissed coldly the tall
strange girl who called him brother spoke a short dry word here and
there then lingering neither for handshaking nor gossip started
silently up the street raising his hat merely to the last eager old
aunty to her open mouthed astonishment the people were distinctly
bewildered this silent cold man was this john where was his
smile and hearty hand grasp peared kind o down in the mouf said
the methodist preacher thoughtfully seemed monstus stuck up
complained a baptist sister but the white postmaster from the edge of
the crowd expressed the opinion of his folks plainly that damn
nigger said he as he shouldered the mail and arranged his tobacco
has gone north and got plum full o fool notions but they wont work
the meeting of welcome at the baptist church was a failure rain
spoiled the barbecue and thunder turned the milk in the ice cream
when the speaking came at night the house was crowded to overflowing
the three preachers had especially prepared themselves but somehow
johns manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything he seemed so
cold and preoccupied and had so strange an air of restraint that the
methodist brother could not warm up to his theme and elicited not a
single amen the presbyterian prayer was but feebly responded to and
even the baptist preacher though he wakened faint enthusiasm got so
mixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to close it by stopping
fully fifteen minutes sooner than he meant the people moved uneasily
in their seats as john rose to reply he spoke slowly and
methodically the age he said demanded new ideas we were far
different from those men of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries with broader ideas of human brotherhood and destiny then
he spoke of the rise of charity and popular education and particularly
of the spread of wealth and work the question was then he added
reflectively looking at the low discolored ceiling what part the
negroes of this land would take in the striving of the new century he
sketched in vague outline the new industrial school that might rise
among these pines he spoke in detail of the charitable and
philanthropic work that might be organized of money that might be
saved for banks and business finally he urged unity and deprecated
especially religious and denominational bickering to day he said
with a smile the world cares little whether a man be baptist or
methodist or indeed a churchman at all so long as he is good and
true what difference does it make whether a man be baptized in river
or washbowl or not at all lets leave all that littleness and look
higher then thinking of nothing else he slowly sat down a
painful hush seized that crowded mass little had they understood of
what he said for he spoke an unknown tongue save the last word about
baptism that they knew and they sat very still while the clock
ticked then at last a low suppressed snarl came from the amen corner
and an old bent man arose walked over the seats and climbed straight
up into the pulpit he was wrinkled and black with scant gray and
tufted hair his voice and hands shook as with palsy but on his face
lay the intense rapt look of the religious fanatic he seized the
bible with his rough huge hands twice he raised it inarticulate and
then fairly burst into words with rude and awful eloquence he
quivered swayed and bent then rose aloft in perfect majesty till
the people moaned and wept wailed and shouted and a wild shrieking
arose from the corners where all the pent up feeling of the hour
gathered itself and rushed into the air john never knew clearly what
the old man said he only felt himself held up to scorn and scathing
denunciation for trampling on the true religion and he realized with
amazement that all unknowingly he had put rough rude hands on
something this little world held sacred he arose silently and passed
out into the night down toward the sea he went in the fitful
starlight half conscious of the girl who followed timidly after him
when at last he stood upon the bluff he turned to his little sister
and looked upon her sorrowfully remembering with sudden pain how
little thought he had given her he put his arm about her and let her
passion of tears spend itself on his shoulder
long they stood together peering over the gray unresting water
john she said does it make every one unhappy when they study and
he paused and smiled i am afraid it does he said
she watched the flickering lights upon the sea and said thoughtfully
i wish i was unhappy and and putting both arms about his neck i
it was several days later that john walked up to the judges house to
ask for the privilege of teaching the negro school the judge himself
met him at the front door stared a little hard at him and said
brusquely go round to the kitchen door john and wait sitting on
the kitchen steps john stared at the corn thoroughly perplexed what
on earth had come over him every step he made offended some one he
had come to save his people and before he left the depot he had hurt
them he sought to teach them at the church and had outraged their
deepest feelings he had schooled himself to be respectful to the
judge and then blundered into his front door and all the time he had
meant right and yet and yet somehow he found it so hard and strange
to fit his old surroundings again to find his place in the world about
him he could not remember that he used to have any difficulty in the
past when life was glad and gay the world seemed smooth and easy
then perhaps but his sister came to the kitchen door just then and
the judge sat in the dining room amid his mornings mail and he did
not ask john to sit down he plunged squarely into the business
youve come for the school i suppose well john i want to speak to
you plainly you know im a friend to your people ive helped you
and your family and would have done more if you hadnt got the notion
of going off now i like the colored people and sympathize with all
their reasonable aspirations but you and i both know john that in
this country the negro must remain subordinate and can never expect to
be the equal of white men in their place your people can be honest
and respectful and god knows ill do what i can to help them but
when they want to reverse nature and rule white men and marry white
women and sit in my parlor then by god well hold them under if we
have to lynch every nigger in the land now john the question is
are you with your education and northern notions going to accept the
situation and teach the darkies to be faithful servants and laborers as
your fathers were i knew your father john he belonged to my
brother and he was a good nigger well well are you going to be
like him or are you going to try to put fool ideas of rising and
equality into these folks heads and make them discontented and
i am going to accept the situation judge henderson answered john
with a brevity that did not escape the keen old man he hesitated a
moment and then said shortly very well well try you awhile
it was a full month after the opening of the negro school that the
other john came home tall gay and headstrong the mother wept the
sisters sang the whole white town was glad a proud man was the
judge and it was a goodly sight to see the two swinging down main
street together and yet all did not go smoothly between them for the
younger man could not and did not veil his contempt for the little
town and plainly had his heart set on new york now the one cherished
ambition of the judge was to see his son mayor of altamaha
representative to the legislature and who could say governor of
georgia so the argument often waxed hot between them good heavens
father the younger man would say after dinner as he lighted a cigar
and stood by the fireplace you surely dont expect a young fellow
like me to settle down permanently in this this god forgotten town
with nothing but mud and negroes i did the judge would answer
laconically and on this particular day it seemed from the gathering
scowl that he was about to add something more emphatic but neighbors
had already begun to drop in to admire his son and the conversation
heah that john is livenin things up at the darky school volunteered
oh nothin in particulah just his almighty air and uppish ways
blieve i did heah somethin about his givin talks on the french
revolution equality and such like hes what i call a dangerous
have you heard him say anything out of the way
why no but sally our girl told my wife a lot of rot then too
i dont need to heah a nigger what wont say sir to a white man
why its little black john peggys son your old playfellow
the young mans face flushed angrily and then he laughed
oh said he its the darky that tried to force himself into a seat
but judge henderson waited to hear no more he had been nettled all
day and now at this he rose with a half smothered oath took his hat
and cane and walked straight to the schoolhouse
for john it had been a long hard pull to get things started in the
rickety old shanty that sheltered his school the negroes were rent
into factions for and against him the parents were careless the
children irregular and dirty and books pencils and slates largely
missing nevertheless he struggled hopefully on and seemed to see at
last some glimmering of dawn the attendance was larger and the
children were a shade cleaner this week even the booby class in
reading showed a little comforting progress so john settled himself
now mandy he said cheerfully thats better but you mustnt chop
your words up so if the man goes why your little brother even
wouldnt tell a story that way now would he
all right now lets try again if the man 
the whole school started in surprise and the teacher half arose as
the red angry face of the judge appeared in the open doorway
john this school is closed you children can go home and get to
work the white people of altamaha are not spending their money on
black folks to have their heads crammed with impudence and lies clear
up at the great pillared house the tall young son wandered aimlessly
about after his fathers abrupt departure in the house there was
little to interest him the books were old and stale the local
newspaper flat and the women had retired with headaches and sewing
he tried a nap but it was too warm so he sauntered out into the
fields complaining disconsolately good lord how long will this
imprisonment last he was not a bad fellow just a little spoiled
and self indulgent and as headstrong as his proud father he seemed a
young man pleasant to look upon as he sat on the great black stump at
the edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking why there
isnt even a girl worth getting up a respectable flirtation with he
growled just then his eye caught a tall willowy figure hurrying
toward him on the narrow path he looked with interest at first and
then burst into a laugh as he said well i declare if it isnt
jennie the little brown kitchen maid why i never noticed before
what a trim little body she is hello jennie why you havent
kissed me since i came home he said gaily the young girl stared at
him in surprise and confusion faltered something inarticulate and
attempted to pass but a wilful mood had seized the young idler and
he caught at her arm frightened she slipped by and half
mischievously he turned and ran after her through the tall pines
yonder toward the sea at the end of the path came john slowly with
his head down he had turned wearily homeward from the schoolhouse
then thinking to shield his mother from the blow started to meet his
sister as she came from work and break the news of his dismissal to
her ill go away he said slowly ill go away and find work and
send for them i cannot live here longer and then the fierce
buried anger surged up into his throat he waved his arms and hurried
the great brown sea lay silent the air scarce breathed the dying
day bathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold there
came from the wind no warning not a whisper from the cloudless sky
there was only a black man hurrying on with an ache in his heart
seeing neither sun nor sea but starting as from a dream at the
frightened cry that woke the pines to see his dark sister struggling
in the arms of a tall and fair haired man
he said not a word but seizing a fallen limb struck him with all the
pent up hatred of his great black arm and the body lay white and still
beneath the pines all bathed in sunshine and in blood john looked at
it dreamily then walked back to the house briskly and said in a soft
voice mammy im going away im going to be free
she gazed at him dimly and faltered noth honey is yo gwine noth
he looked out where the north star glistened pale above the waters and
then without another word he went out into the narrow lane up by the
straight pines to the same winding path and seated himself on the
great black stump looking at the blood where the body had lain
yonder in the gray past he had played with that dead boy romping
together under the solemn trees the night deepened he thought of the
boys at johnstown he wondered how brown had turned out and carey
and jones jones why he was jones and he wondered what they would
all say when they knew when they knew in that great long dining room
with its hundreds of merry eyes then as the sheen of the starlight
stole over him he thought of the gilded ceiling of that vast concert
hall heard stealing toward him the faint sweet music of the swan
hark was it music or the hurry and shouting of men yes surely
clear and high the faint sweet melody rose and fluttered like a living
thing so that the very earth trembled as with the tramp of horses and
he leaned back and smiled toward the sea whence rose the strange
melody away from the dark shadows where lay the noise of horses
galloping galloping on with an effort he roused himself bent
forward and looked steadily down the pathway softly humming the song
amid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows
dancing and heard their horses thundering toward him until at last
they came sweeping like a storm and he saw in front that haggard
white haired man whose eyes flashed red with fury oh how he pitied
him pitied him and wondered if he had the coiling twisted rope
then as the storm burst round him he rose slowly to his feet and
i know moon rise i know star rise
i walk in the moonlight i walk in the starlight
ill lie in the grave and stretch out my arms
ill go to judgment in the evening of the day
and my soul and thy soul shall meet that day
they that walked in darkness sang songs in the olden days sorrow
songs for they were weary at heart and so before each thought that i
have written in this book i have set a phrase a haunting echo of these
weird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men
ever since i was a child these songs have stirred me strangely they
came out of the south unknown to me one by one and yet at once i knew
them as of me and of mine then in after years when i came to
nashville i saw the great temple builded of these songs towering over
the pale city to me jubilee hall seemed ever made of the songs
themselves and its bricks were red with the blood and dust of toil
out of them rose for me morning noon and night bursts of wonderful
melody full of the voices of my brothers and sisters full of the
little of beauty has america given the world save the rude grandeur god
himself stamped on her bosom the human spirit in this new world has
expressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in beauty and so
by fateful chance the negro folk song the rhythmic cry of the
slave stands to day not simply as the sole american music but as the
most beautiful expression of human experience born this side the seas
it has been neglected it has been and is half despised and above
all it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood but
notwithstanding it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of
the nation and the greatest gift of the negro people
away back in the thirties the melody of these slave songs stirred the
nation but the songs were soon half forgotten some like near the
lake where drooped the willow passed into current airs and their
source was forgotten others were caricatured on the minstrel stage
and their memory died away then in war time came the singular port
royal experiment after the capture of hilton head and perhaps for the
first time the north met the southern slave face to face and heart to
heart with no third witness the sea islands of the carolinas where
they met were filled with a black folk of primitive type touched and
moulded less by the world about them than any others outside the black
belt their appearance was uncouth their language funny but their
hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power
thomas wentworth higginson hastened to tell of these songs and miss
mckim and others urged upon the world their rare beauty but the world
listened only half credulously until the fisk jubilee singers sang the
slave songs so deeply into the worlds heart that it can never wholly
there was once a blacksmiths son born at cadiz new york who in the
changes of time taught school in ohio and helped defend cincinnati from
kirby smith then he fought at chancellorsville and gettysburg and
finally served in the freedmens bureau at nashville here he formed a
sunday school class of black children in 1866 and sang with them and
taught them to sing and then they taught him to sing and when once
the glory of the jubilee songs passed into the soul of george l white
he knew his life work was to let those negroes sing to the world as
they had sung to him so in 1871 the pilgrimage of the fisk jubilee
singers began north to cincinnati they rode four half clothed black
boys and five girl women led by a man with a cause and a purpose
they stopped at wilberforce the oldest of negro schools where a black
bishop blessed them then they went fighting cold and starvation
shut out of hotels and cheerfully sneered at ever northward and ever
the magic of their song kept thrilling hearts until a burst of
applause in the congregational council at oberlin revealed them to the
world they came to new york and henry ward beecher dared to welcome
them even though the metropolitan dailies sneered at his nigger
minstrels so their songs conquered till they sang across the land
and across the sea before queen and kaiser in scotland and ireland
holland and switzerland seven years they sang and brought back a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to found fisk university
since their day they have been imitated sometimes well by the singers
of hampton and atlanta sometimes ill by straggling quartettes
caricature has sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music
and has filled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears
scarce know from the real but the true negro folk song still lives in
the hearts of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts of
what are these songs and what do they mean i know little of music
and can say nothing in technical phrase but i know something of men
and knowing them i know that these songs are the articulate message of
the slave to the world they tell us in these eager days that life was
joyous to the black slave careless and happy i can easily believe
this of some of many but not all the past south though it rose from
the dead can gainsay the heart touching witness of these songs they
are the music of an unhappy people of the children of disappointment
they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer
the songs are indeed the siftings of centuries the music is far more
ancient than the words and in it we can trace here and there signs of
development my grandfathers grandmother was seized by an evil dutch
trader two centuries ago and coming to the valleys of the hudson and
housatonic black little and lithe she shivered and shrank in the
harsh north winds looked longingly at the hills and often crooned a
heathen melody to the child between her knees thus
do ba na co ba ge ne me ge ne me
do ba na co ba ge ne me ge ne me
ben d nu li nu li nu li ben d le
the child sang it to his children and they to their childrens
children and so two hundred years it has travelled down to us and we
sing it to our children knowing as little as our fathers what its
words may mean but knowing well the meaning of its music
this was primitive african music it may be seen in larger form in the
strange chant which heralds the coming of john
but ill hear the trumpet sound in that morning
ten master songs more or less one may pluck from the forest of
melody songs of undoubted negro origin and wide popular currency and
songs peculiarly characteristic of the slave one of these i have just
mentioned another whose strains begin this book is nobody knows the
trouble ive seen when struck with a sudden poverty the united
states refused to fulfill its promises of land to the freedmen a
brigadier general went down to the sea islands to carry the news an
old woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song all
the mass joined with her swaying and the soldier wept
the third song is the cradle song of death which all men know swing
low sweet chariot whose bars begin the life story of alexander
crummell then there is the song of many waters roll jordan
roll a mighty chorus with minor cadences there were many songs of
the fugitive like that which opens the wings of atalanta and the
more familiar been a listening the seventh is the song of the end
and the beginning my lord what a mourning when the stars begin to
fall a strain of this is placed before the dawn of freedom the
song of groping my ways cloudy begins the meaning of progress
the ninth is the song of this chapter wrestlin jacob the day is
a breaking a paean of hopeful strife the last master song is the
song of songs steal away sprung from the faith of the fathers
there are many others of the negro folk songs as striking and
characteristic as these as for instance the three strains in the
third eighth and ninth chapters and others i am sure could easily
make a selection on more scientific principles there are too songs
that seem to be a step removed from the more primitive types there is
the maze like medley bright sparkles one phrase of which heads the
black belt the easter carol dust dust and ashes the dirge my
mothers took her flight and gone home and that burst of melody
hovering over the passing of the first born i hope my mother will
be there in that beautiful world on high
these represent a third step in the development of the slave song of
which you may bury me in the east is the first and songs like march
on chapter six and steal away are the second the first is
african music the second afro american while the third is a blending
of negro music with the music heard in the foster land the result is
still distinctively negro and the method of blending original but the
elements are both negro and caucasian one might go further and find a
fourth step in this development where the songs of white america have
been distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated
whole phrases of negro melody as swanee river and old black joe
side by side too with the growth has gone the debasements and
imitations the negro minstrel songs many of the gospel hymns and
some of the contemporary coon songs a mass of music in which the
novice may easily lose himself and never find the real negro melodies
in these songs i have said the slave spoke to the world such a
message is naturally veiled and half articulate words and music have
lost each other and new and cant phrases of a dimly understood theology
have displaced the older sentiment once in a while we catch a strange
word of an unknown tongue as the mighty myo which figures as a
river of death more often slight words or mere doggerel are joined to
music of singular sweetness purely secular songs are few in number
partly because many of them were turned into hymns by a change of
words partly because the frolics were seldom heard by the stranger
and the music less often caught of nearly all the songs however the
music is distinctly sorrowful the ten master songs i have mentioned
tell in word and music of trouble and exile of strife and hiding they
grope toward some unseen power and sigh for rest in the end
the words that are left to us are not without interest and cleared of
evident dross they conceal much of real poetry and meaning beneath
conventional theology and unmeaning rhapsody like all primitive folk
the slave stood near to natures heart life was a rough and rolling
sea like the brown atlantic of the sea islands the wilderness was
the home of god and the lonesome valley led to the way of life
winterll soon be over was the picture of life and death to a
tropical imagination the sudden wild thunderstorms of the south awed
and impressed the negroes at times the rumbling seemed to them
the monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words one sees
the ploughmen in the hot moist furrow singing
the bowed and bent old man cries with thrice repeated wail
and he rebukes the devil of doubt who can whisper
yet the soul hunger is there the restlessness of the savage the wail
of the wanderer and the plaint is put in one little phrase
my soul wants something thats new thats new
over the inner thoughts of the slaves and their relations one with
another the shadow of fear ever hung so that we get but glimpses here
and there and also with them eloquent omissions and silences mother
and child are sung but seldom father fugitive and weary wanderer call
for pity and affection but there is little of wooing and wedding the
rocks and the mountains are well known but home is unknown strange
blending of love and helplessness sings through the refrain
elsewhere comes the cry of the motherless and the farewell
love songs are scarce and fall into two categories the frivolous and
light and the sad of deep successful love there is ominous silence
and in one of the oldest of these songs there is a depth of history and
poor ro sy poor gal poor ro sy
poor gal ro sy break my poor heart
a black woman said of the song it cant be sung without a full heart
and a troubled sperrit the same voice sings here that sings in the
jetz geh i ans brunele trink aber net
of death the negro showed little fear but talked of it familiarly and
even fondly as simply a crossing of the waters perhaps who
knows back to his ancient forests again later days transfigured his
fatalism and amid the dust and dirt the toiler sang
dust dust and ashes fly over my grave
but the lord shall bear my spirit home
the things evidently borrowed from the surrounding world undergo
characteristic change when they enter the mouth of the slave
especially is this true of bible phrases weep o captive daughter of
zion is quaintly turned into zion weep a low and the wheels of
ezekiel are turned every way in the mystic dreaming of the slave till
theres a little wheel a turnin in a my heart
as in olden time the words of these hymns were improvised by some
leading minstrel of the religious band the circumstances of the
gathering however the rhythm of the songs and the limitations of
allowable thought confined the poetry for the most part to single or
double lines and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer
tales although there are some few examples of sustained efforts
chiefly paraphrases of the bible three short series of verses have
always attracted me the one that heads this chapter of one line of
which thomas wentworth higginson has fittingly said never it seems
to me since man first lived and suffered was his infinite longing for
peace uttered more plaintively the second and third are descriptions
of the last judgment the one a late improvisation with some traces
oh the stars in the elements are falling
and the ransomed of the lord are returning unto god
and the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands
through all the sorrow of the sorrow songs there breathes a hope a
faith in the ultimate justice of things the minor cadences of despair
change often to triumph and calm confidence sometimes it is faith in
life sometimes a faith in death sometimes assurance of boundless
justice in some fair world beyond but whichever it is the meaning is
always clear that sometime somewhere men will judge men by their
souls and not by their skins is such a hope justified do the sorrow
the silently growing assumption of this age is that the probation of
races is past and that the backward races of to day are of proven
inefficiency and not worth the saving such an assumption is the
arrogance of peoples irreverent toward time and ignorant of the deeds
of men a thousand years ago such an assumption easily possible
would have made it difficult for the teuton to prove his right to life
two thousand years ago such dogmatism readily welcome would have
scouted the idea of blond races ever leading civilization so wofully
unorganized is sociological knowledge that the meaning of progress the
meaning of swift and slow in human doing and the limits of human
perfectability are veiled unanswered sphinxes on the shores of
science why should aeschylus have sung two thousand years before
shakespeare was born why has civilization flourished in europe and
flickered flamed and died in africa so long as the world stands
meekly dumb before such questions shall this nation proclaim its
ignorance and unhallowed prejudices by denying freedom of opportunity
to those who brought the sorrow songs to the seats of the mighty
your country how came it yours before the pilgrims landed we were
here here we have brought our three gifts and mingled them with
yours a gift of story and song soft stirring melody in an
ill harmonized and unmelodious land the gift of sweat and brawn to
beat back the wilderness conquer the soil and lay the foundations of
this vast economic empire two hundred years earlier than your weak
hands could have done it the third a gift of the spirit around us
the history of the land has centred for thrice a hundred years out of
the nations heart we have called all that was best to throttle and
subdue all that was worst fire and blood prayer and sacrifice have
billowed over this people and they have found peace only in the altars
of the god of right nor has our gift of the spirit been merely
passive actively we have woven ourselves with the very warp and woof
of this nation we fought their battles shared their sorrow mingled
our blood with theirs and generation after generation have pleaded
with a headstrong careless people to despise not justice mercy and
truth lest the nation be smitten with a curse our song our toil
our cheer and warning have been given to this nation in
blood brotherhood are not these gifts worth the giving is not this
work and striving would america have been america without her negro
even so is the hope that sang in the songs of my fathers well sung if
somewhere in this whirl and chaos of things there dwells eternal good
pitiful yet masterful then anon in his good time america shall rend
the veil and the prisoned shall go free free free as the sunshine
trickling down the morning into these high windows of mine free as
yonder fresh young voices welling up to me from the caverns of brick
and mortar below swelling with song instinct with life tremulous
treble and darkening bass my children my little children are
singing to the sunshine and thus they sing
let us cheer the wea ry trav el ler
cheer the wea ry trav el ler let us
and the traveller girds himself and sets his face toward the morning
hear my cry o god the reader vouchsafe that this my book fall not
still born into the world wilderness let there spring gentle one
from out its leaves vigor of thought and thoughtful deed to reap the
harvest wonderful let the ears of a guilty people tingle with truth
and seventy millions sigh for the righteousness which exalteth nations
in this drear day when human brotherhood is mockery and a snare thus
in thy good time may infinite reason turn the tangle straight and
these crooked marks on a fragile leaf be not indeed
