we are all in gods hands said he with a sigh
dronushka alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn
to is it true as they tell me that i cant even go away
why shouldnt you go away your excellency you can go said dron
i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy dear friend i
can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i want to go away
dron paused he looked askance at princess mary and said there are no
its all gods scourge said dron what horses we had have been taken
for the army or have died this is such a year its not a case of
feeding horses we may die of hunger ourselves as it is some go three
days without eating weve nothing weve been ruined
princess mary listened attentively to what he told her
the peasants are ruined they have no bread she asked
theyre dying of hunger said dron its not a case of carting
but why didnt you tell me dronushka isnt it possible to help them
to princess mary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrow
was filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the rich
could refrain from helping the poor she had heard vaguely that there
was such a thing as landlords corn which was sometimes given to the
peasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
refuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make some
mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
give she was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her without
scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the
peasants needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the
but we have grain belonging to my brother she said
the landlords grain is all safe replied dron proudly our prince
give it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you leave
give them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all i give
this order in my brothers name and tell them that what is ours is
theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so
dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking
discharge me little mother for gods sake order the keys to be taken
from me said he i have served twenty three years and have done no
princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his
devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come and
all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess order and
but i never told them to come said princess mary i only told dron
only for gods sake princess dear have them sent away and dont go
out to them its all a trick said dunyasha and when yakov alpatych
returns let us get away and please dont
what is a trick asked princess mary in surprise
i know it is only listen to me for gods sake ask nurse too they say
they dont agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered
youre making some mistake i never ordered them to go away said
dron came and confirmed dunyashas words the peasants had come by the
but i never sent for them declared the princess you must have given
my message wrong i only said that you were to give them the grain
if you order it they will go away said he
no no ill go out to them said princess mary and in spite of the
nurses and dunyashas protests she went out into the porch dron
dunyasha the nurse and michael ivanovich following her
they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to
remain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
french thought princess mary i will offer them monthly rations and
housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in my
place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd
the men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off their
hats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt came
close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on
her and there were so many different faces that she could not
distinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all at
once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she
represented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldly
i am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes and
feeling her heart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells me
that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i shall
grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is
dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving you
everything my friends and i beg you to take everything all our grain
so that you may not suffer want and if you have been told that i am
giving you the grain to keep you here that is not true on the
contrary i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near
moscow and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for
nothing you shall be given food and lodging
the princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd
i am not doing this on my own account she continued i do it in the
name of my dead father who was a good master to you and of my brother
again she paused no one broke the silence
ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together all that is
mine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her
all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she could
not fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude or
apprehension and distrust but the expression on all the faces was
we are all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us to
take the landlords grain said a voice at the back of the crowd
no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found that
every eye she met now was immediately dropped
but why dont you want to take it she asked again
the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
why dont you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just in
front of her leaning on his stick if you think something more is
wanted tell me i will do anything said she catching his eye
but as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered
why should we agree we dont want the grain
why should we give up everything we dont agree dont agree we
are sorry for you but were not willing go away yourself alone
and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression
though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude
but you cant have understood me said princess mary with a sad smile
why dont you want to go i promise to house and feed you while here
but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd
were not willing let them ruin us we wont take your grain we dont
again princess mary tried to catch someones eye but not a single eye
in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid
oh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your houses
and go into bondage i dare say ill give you grain indeed she
says voices in the crowd were heard saying
with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the
house having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her
departure next morning she went to her room and remained alone with her
for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her
room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from the
village but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that she
could not understand them however much she might think about them she
thought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused by
cares for the present seemed already to belong to the past now she
after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh toward
midnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon began
to show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began to
rise and stillness reigned over the village and the house
pictures of the near past her fathers illness and last moments rose
one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingered
over these images repelling with horror only the last one the picture
of his death which she felt she could not contemplate even in
imagination at this still and mystic hour of night and these pictures
presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
seemed now present now past and now future
she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills
muttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his gray
eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her
even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died she
thought he had always thought what he said then and she recalled in
all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke
when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his
will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going
to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
at the door in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to
tikhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress
evidently he had wanted to talk and why didnt he call me why didnt
he let me be there instead of tikhon princess mary had thought and
thought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in his
soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
said all he longed to say and not tikhon but i might have heard and
understood him why didnt i enter the room she thought perhaps he
would then have said to me what he said the day he died while talking
to tikhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was
standing close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him to
talk to tikhon who did not understand him i remember how he began
speaking to him about lise as if she were alive he had forgotten she
was dead and tikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted
fool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he
lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why didnt
i go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost and
perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
to me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
to her on the day of his death dear est she repeated and began
sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face before
her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and
had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen
for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details
when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said
what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking
now this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer she
saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in
his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the
horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself
that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her
again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do
neither with wide open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows
expecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that the
silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast
dunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearing
herself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meet
her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her
on the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin accompanied by lavrushka
who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly left
their quarters at yankovo ten miles from bogucharovo and went for a
ride to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there
was any hay to be had in the villages
for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile
armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as
for the french vanguard rostov as a careful squadron commander wished
to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french
rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to
bogucharovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they
hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questioned
lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one
rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister
rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
incline before reaching bogucharovo and rostov outstripping ilyin was
the first to gallop into the village street
yes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostov
and id have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka from
behind alluding to his shabby cart horse only i didnt wish to
they rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants was
some of the men bared their heads others stared at the new arrivals
without doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
and scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering and
singing some incoherent song and approached the officers
fine fellows said rostov laughing is there any hay here
a mo o st me r r y co o m pa sang one of the peasants with a
one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov
the french replied ilyin jestingly and here is napoleon himself
then you are russians the peasant asked again
and is there a large force of you here said another a short man
very large answered rostov but why have you collected here he
the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune replied
at that moment on the road leading from the big house two women and a
man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers
the one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing dunyasha
shell be ours said lavrushka to ilyin winking
what do you want my pretty said ilyin with a smile
the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name
this is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble
co o om pa ny roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he
looked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych
advanced to rostov having bared his head while still at a distance
may i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but with
a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
thrust into his bosom my mistress daughter of general in chief prince
nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month finding
herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people he
pointed to the peasants asks you to come up to the house wont
you please ride on a little farther said alpatych with a melancholy
smile as it is not convenient in the presence of he pointed to
the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse
ah alpatych ah yakov alpatych grand forgive us for christs
sake eh said the peasants smiling joyfully at him
rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled
or perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid air
as he pointed at the old men with his free hand
no theres not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode on a
i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here dont wish
to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to unharness her
horses so that though everything has been packed up since morning her
i have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatych
rostov dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpatych
to the house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appeared
that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day and
her talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effect
that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
not appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning when
the princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants had
come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
her leave the village that there was an order not to move and that
they would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish them
but was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing
himself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go that
there was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they would
serve her as before and obey her in everything
at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road
princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych her nurse and the
maids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the
cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman ran
away and the women in the house began to wail
father benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices as
princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting
room when rostov was shown in she could not grasp who he was and why
he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his russian
face and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
man of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion this
meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event a helpless girl
overwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasants
and what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there
are in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her and
when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her
fathers funeral her voice trembled she turned away and then as if
fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked at
him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in rostovs
eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten
i cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride here
and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostov rising go
when you please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort
and bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved toward
rostovs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
consider himself happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish to
take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her
princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy
i am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope it
was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she
rostov knitting his brows left the room with another low bow
well is she pretty ah friend my pink one is delicious her name is
but on glancing at rostovs face ilyin stopped short he saw that his
hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought
rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with
ill show them ill give it to them the brigands said he to
alpatych at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up with
what decision have you been pleased to come to said he
rostov stopped and clenching his fists suddenly and sternly turned on
decision what decision old dotard cried he what have you been
about eh the peasants are rioting and you cant manage them youre a
traitor yourself i know you ill flay you all alive and as if
afraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidly
forward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace with
rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said the
peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
imprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it not
be better first to send for the military
ill give them armed force ill overresist them uttered rostov
meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to
without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick
resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the more
alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results
the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw
rostovs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face
after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the
princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and
might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was of
this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked
how many years have you been fattening on the commune karp shouted at
him its all one to you youll dig up your pot of money and take it
away with you what does it matter to you whether our homes are
weve been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homes
or take away a single grain and thats all about it cried another
it was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudged
your lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dron
and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier but we all have
to be sure we all have to die im not against the commune said
thats it not against it youve filled your belly
the two tall peasants had their say as soon as rostov followed by
ilyin lavrushka and alpatych came up to the crowd karp thrusting
his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the front
dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer
who is your elder here hey shouted rostov coming up to the crowd
the elder what do you want with him asked karp
but before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a
fierce blow jerked his head to one side
caps off traitors shouted rostov in a wrathful voice wheres the
the elder he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek and
flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
we dont riot were following the orders declared karp and at that
its as the old men have decided theres too many of you giving
arguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostov unmeaningly in a
voice not his own gripping karp by the collar bind him bind him he
shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych
lavrushka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from
shall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called out
alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come
and bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
wheres the elder demanded rostov in a loud voice
with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd
are you the elder bind him lavrushka shouted rostov as if that
order too could not possibly meet with any opposition
and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his own
belt and handed it to them as if to aid them
and you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants be off to your
houses at once and dont let one of your voices be heard
why weve not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness its
all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heard
there what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again its
all our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowd
began at once to disperse through the village
the two bound men were led off to the masters house the two drunken
aye when i look at you said one of them to karp
how can one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking of
you fool added the other a real fool
two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
bogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out the
proprietors goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at
princess marys wish from the cupboard where he had been confined was
dont put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with a
round smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid you know it has
cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord
where itll get rubbed i dont like that way of doing things let it
all be done properly according to rule look here put it under the
bast matting and cover it with hay thats the way
eh books books said another peasant bringing out prince andrews
library cupboards dont catch up against it its heavy lads solid
yes they worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall round
faced peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at the
unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostov did not go back to
the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her
carriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eight
miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops at
the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first time
how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess marys
expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had
occurred any police officer would have done as much if we had had
only peasants to fight we should not have let the enemy come so far
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i am
only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance
good bye princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to
meet you again in happier circumstances if you dont want to make me
but the princess if she did not again thank him in words thanked him
with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and
tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not been
there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
french and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
to save her and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
noble soul able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind
honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
cry as she spoke of her loss did not leave her memory
when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her
eyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the strange
question presented itself to her did she love him
on the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was not
a cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage more than
once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow
well supposing i do love him thought princess mary
ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in
love with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herself
with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not
be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to
the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for
the first and last time in her life
sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his words
happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments that
dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window
was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very
moment thought princess mary and that caused his sister to refuse my
brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence
the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one to
remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of his
adventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay and
having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew
angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
princess mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune
had against his will more than once entered his head for himself
personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he
would make the countess his mother happy would be able to put his
fathers affairs in order and would even he felt it ensure princess
but sonya and his plighted word that was why rostov grew angry when he
on receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew and
sent an order for him to report at headquarters
prince andrew arrived at tsarevo zaymishche on the very day and at the
very hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time he
stopped in the village at the priests house in front of which stood the
commander in chiefs carriage and he sat down on the bench at the gate
awaiting his serene highness as everyone now called kutuzov from the
field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
roar of many voices shouting hurrah to the new commander in chief
two orderlies a courier and a major domo stood near by some ten paces
from prince andrew availing themselves of kutuzovs absence and of the
fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince
andrew inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and
prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness staff but
was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
orderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in
what his serene highness i expect hell be here soon what do you
the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
orderlys tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner and
approached bolkonski with a slight bow bolkonski made room for him on
the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him
youre also waiting for the commander in chief said he they say he
weceives evewyone thank god its awful with those sausage eaters
ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german now pwaps
wussians will get a look in as it was devil only knows what was
happening we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in the
i had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking part in
the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dear not to
mention the estate and home of my birth my father who died of grief i
ah youre pwince bolkonski vewy glad to make your acquaintance im
lieutenant colonel denisov better known as vaska said denisov
pressing prince andrews hand and looking into his face with a
particularly kindly attention yes i heard said he sympathetically
and after a short pause added yes its scythian warfare its all
vewy well only not for those who get it in the neck so you are pwince
andwew bolkonski he swayed his head vewy pleased pwince to make
your acquaintance he repeated again smiling sadly and he again
prince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her first
suitor this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful
feelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found place
in his soul of late he had received so many new and very serious
impressions such as the retreat from smolensk his visit to bald hills
and the recent news of his fathers death and had experienced so many
emotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
mind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly their
former strength for denisov too the memories awakened by the name of
bolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and
after natashas singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen
without realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection of
that time and of his love for natasha and passed at once to what now
interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan of campaign
he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had
proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to
kutuzov the plan was based on the fact that the french line of
operation was too extended and it proposed that instead of or
concurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the french
we should attack their line of communication he began explaining his
they cant hold all that line its impossible i will undertake to
bweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line
thats certain theres only one way guewilla warfare
denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
bolkonski in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the
army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music and
songs and coming from the field where the review was held sounds of
hes coming hes coming shouted a cossack standing at the gate
bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers a
guard of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down the
street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generals
rode behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd of
officers ran after and around them shouting hurrah
his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was impatiently
urging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and he
raised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a red band and no
peak nodding his head continually when he came up to the guard of
honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations who were
giving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively for
nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his face
assumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air of
and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well good by
general he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and
since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still more
corpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball the scar and the
familiar weariness of his expression were still the same he was wearing
the white horse guards cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging
over his shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply on
whew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
yard his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who
means to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrup
and lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the
effort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his knee
groaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants
he pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glanced
at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with his
waddling gait to the porch whew whew whew he whistled and
again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old men it was
only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrews
face linked itself up with kutuzovs remembrance of his personality
ah how do you do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy come
along said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porch
he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch
i received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew
kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
may the kingdom of heaven be his gods will be done to us all he
sighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while i
loved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my heart
he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for some
time did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw that
kutuzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes he
sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself
come come with me well have a talk said he
but at that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors than by
the enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despite
the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutuzov his
hands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denisov having
given his name announced that he had to communicate to his serene
highness a matter of great importance for their countrys welfare
kutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture of
annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words for our
countrys welfare well what is it speak denisov blushed like a girl
it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous time
worn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemys
lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov came from
those parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good
one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke
kutuzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the door
of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from
it and from that hut while denisov was speaking a general with a
what said kutuzov in the midst of denisovs explanations are you
kutuzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal with
i give my word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that i
what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov
ah we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all right
friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow well have a talk
with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
would not your serene highness like to come inside said the general
on duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and several
an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
within but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
no tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy ill look
at them here said he dont go away he added turning to prince
andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals report
while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a womans
voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on
glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome
woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a
dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief
kutuzovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of
the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serene
highness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highness
with the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in the
house shes very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at those
words kutuzov looked round he was listening to the generals report
which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsarevo
zaymishche as he had listened to denisov and seven years previously
had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war he
evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a
piece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident
that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him
that he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all only
because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of
prayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the point what the
general was saying was even more clever and to the point but it was
evident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew of
something else that would decide the matter something independent of
cleverness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander in chiefs
face attentively and the only expression he could see there was one of
boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind
the door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutuzov
despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by
denisov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelings
or knowledge he did not try to display any of these but because of
something else he despised them because of his old age and experience
of life the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during that
report referred to looting by the russian troops at the end of the
report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the
recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the
after hearing the matter kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook
into the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all my
dear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cut
the crops and burn wood to their hearts content i dont order it or
allow it but i dont exact compensation either one cant get on
without it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the
paper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his head
well thats all said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents
and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression
the priests wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had after
all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long
been preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov
he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and said
he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
dish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he asked
moving to the door of the room assigned to him the priests wife
smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room
the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with
him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov he
found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned
overcoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as prince
andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the
cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
well sit down sit down here lets have a talk said kutuzov its
sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you
prince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his fathers death and what
he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it
what what they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly cried in an
agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince
andrews story the condition russia was in but give me time give me
