qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him in
the world he had lived in his strength his disdain for the comforts of
life his absent mindedness and simplicity here among these people gave
him almost the status of a hero and pierre felt that their opinion
the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh
of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troops
at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim wearing shakos
and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front of
the sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all
in the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaited
the order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and thin with dark
shadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed
his eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringly
at his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moaned
regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that
caused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at being
pierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had
made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest
and brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man and
you know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospital
here you may be better off than we others said pierre
o lord oh it will be the death of me o lord moaned the man in a
ill go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to
just as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipe
the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal and
soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
the corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisoners
had to be counted before being let out
corporal what will they do with the sick man pierre began
but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he
knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at pierres
words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door the shed
became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned
there it is it again said pierre to himself and an
involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the corporals changed face
in the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of the
drums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelled
people against their will to kill their fellow men that force the
effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to
try to escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to those
who served as its tools was useless pierre knew this now one had to
wait and endure he did not again go to the sick man nor turn to look
at him but stood frowning by the door of the hut
when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one
another like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed his
way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also in
marching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre
had recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the drums
pass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly and
looking at the prisoners who thronged past him
pierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vain
what now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
hell manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on pass
be so good shouted the captain frowning angrily
dram da da dam dam dam rattled the drums and pierre understood
that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it
the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march
in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them and
the officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers to
pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at his
shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a fat major
with a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazan dressing
gown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
his fellow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobacco
pouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
pipe firmly with the other panting and puffing the major grumbled and
growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all
surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at
another a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing
where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day an
official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from
side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing his
observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part
of the city was that they could see a third officer who by his accent
was a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he was
mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow
what are you disputing about said the major angrily what does it
matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see its burned
down and theres an end of it what are you pushing for isnt the
road wide enough said he turning to a man behind him who was not
oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another
were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins all beyond the
river and zubova and in the kremlin just look theres not half of
it left yes i told you the whole quarter beyond the river and so it
well you know its burned so whats the use of talking said the
as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned
quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard
ah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is and
pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these
exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palings
surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw better
than he did he found that this was the body of a man set upright
against the palings with its face smeared with soot
go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convoy
guards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence
drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at
through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners
marched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
belonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores they
came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
at the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get across
from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage
trains before and behind them to the right where the kaluga road turns
near neskuchny endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the
distance these were troops of beauharnais corps which had started
before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the
davouts troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing the
crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road
but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais
train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the
vanguard of neys army was already emerging from the great ordynka
when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and men
crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred paces
that separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking more than an hour
to do so and came out upon the square where the streets of the
transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge and the prisoners jammed
close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway from all
sides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels the
tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stood
pressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noise
which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums
to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
the half burned house against which pierre was leaning
what crowds just look at the crowds theyve loaded goods even on
the cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed just see what
the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind in
the cart why those are settings taken from some icons by
heaven oh the rascals see how that fellow has loaded himself
up he can hardly walk good lord theyve even grabbed those
chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavens
thats right hit him on the snout on his snout like this we shant
get away before evening look look there why that must be
napoleons own see what horses and the monograms with a crown its
like a portable house that fellows dropped his sack and doesnt see
it fighting again a woman with a baby and not bad looking either
yes i dare say thats the way theyll let you pass just look
theres no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are in
again as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity bore
all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to his
stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their
curiosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts closely
squeezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaring
colors who were shouting something in shrill voices
from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpse
smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
ruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression
on him as if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to
the womens vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldiers
wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition carts
pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement
all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
power during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from
the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly
they all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight white
teeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew from
side to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and
coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the
it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
the baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emerged
they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sun
began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began
to prepare for their nights rest they all appeared angry and
dissatisfied for a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting could
be heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran into
one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole several
soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the
carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among
themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head
it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in
the chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the same
feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on
that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed
to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that
much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey
during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time
from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to
this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of
prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian
soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw
a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the
road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court
martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
russian to the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner was
ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shoot
those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had
crushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during his
imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but
he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
him there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his
neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in
moscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of the
order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reaction
against the worsening of their position they were all particularly
animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing
scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of
the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the
sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the
rising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray
haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yet
come pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between the
campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on
the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back
pierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to an
unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him and
dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he
burst out into a fit of his broad good natured laughter so loud that
men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
ha ha ha laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldier
did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive
what me me my immortal soul ha ha ha ha ha ha and he laughed
a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at
all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away from
the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the
red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light
sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseen
before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond
those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance
lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling
stars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me
and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it
into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to
in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letter
from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though
napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga road
kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace
soon after that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilla
detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of broussiers
division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the
rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and
officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the
memory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutuzov to carry out
dorokhovs suggestion kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary
the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was
by a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most
difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturov that same
modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up
plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses
on batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding wherever the
position was most difficult all through the russo french wars from
austerlitz to the year 1813 at austerlitz he remained last at the
augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all
were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
guard ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to
defend the town against napoleons whole army in smolensk at the
malakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolensk held out all
day long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and nine
tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
french artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there was
this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturov kutuzov hastening to
rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and
the quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino became the
greatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described to
us in verse and prose but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said
it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to
malo yaroslavets the place where the last battle with the french was
fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began
and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
campaign but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that
dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to
it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and
is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
important part the man who does not understand the construction of the
machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and
not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working
on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and
stopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute the
orders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsive
movement reached murats position apparently in order to give battle
suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kaluga
road and began to enter forminsk where only broussier had been till
then at that time dokhturov had under his command besides dorokhovs
detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin
on the evening of october 11 seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters
with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that the
troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
army that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four
days previously that same evening a house serf who had come from
borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town some
cossacks of dokhturovs detachment reported having sighted the french
guards marching along the road to borovsk from all these reports it was
evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was
now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected
direction along the kaluga road dokhturov was unwilling to undertake
any action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do he had
been ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there at
that time and now the whole french army was there ermolov wished to act
on his own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzovs
instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff
for this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who was
to explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering a
written report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received the
dispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the general staff
it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four days
having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a
half over a sticky muddy road bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after
one oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence
hung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins he entered
the general on duty quick its very important said he to someone
who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage
he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you should
but this is very important from general dokhturov said
bolkhovitinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody
what whats that from whom came a sleepy voice
from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk
said bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn
the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself
i dont like waking him he said fumbling for something he is very
here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give it at
wait a moment ill light a candle you damned rascal where do you
always hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching himself
to the orderly this was shcherbinin konovnitsyns adjutant ive
the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for
oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust
by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinins youthful face
as he held the candle and the face of another man who was still asleep
when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up
first blue and then red shcherbinin lit the tallow candle from the
candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
running away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespattered
all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve
who gave the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelope
the news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks and
theres nothing to be done well have to wake him said shcherbinin
rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a
greatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir to
the general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words would
and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on
konovnitsyns handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever
there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
from present affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumed
well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurry
while listening to the officers report konovnitsyn broke the seal and
read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
boots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples
did you get here quickly let us go to his highness
konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or ask
himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him he
regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his
reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed
conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this
and still less speak about it but must only attend to ones own work
and he did his work giving his whole strength to the task
peter petrovich konovnitsyn like dokhturov seems to have been included
merely for proprietys sake in the list of the so called heroes of 1812
the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches like
dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity
and information and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but
was always found where the situation was most difficult since his
appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open
giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in
battle he was always under fire so that kutuzov reproved him for it and
feared to send him to the front and like dokhturov he was one of those
unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the most
coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frowned
partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant
thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men on
the staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen who
ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov and how they
would make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them and
this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be
and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediately
began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters until
konovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must
kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fell
asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed
so he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head on
his plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into the
since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more
influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutuzov
was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being
obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the
tarutino battle and of the day before it which kutuzov remembered with
pain must he thought have some effect on others too
they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive
patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov he
knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fall
of itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the tree
is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsman
he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the whole
strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally
wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of
lauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of the
guerrillas kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but he
needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait
they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall
see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for
only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are like
children from whom one cant get any sensible account of what has
happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but
and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to them
that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he
remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they have
the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was
mortal or not had hung over kutuzovs head for a whole month on the one
hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt assured
with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the
russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in any
case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grew
more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those
sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just like
the younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands of
contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the
longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he
imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in
sections against petersburg or against him or to outflank him he
thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that
napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow
awaiting him kutuzov even imagined that napoleons army might turn back
through medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee was
what happened the insane convulsive stampede of napoleons army during
its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which made
possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete
extermination of the french dorokhovs report about broussiers
division the guerrillas reports of distress in napoleons army rumors
of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that
the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only
suppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not to
kutuzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attach
to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily
in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he
desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question
absorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only lifes
customary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversations
with the staff the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael
the reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence
with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he
on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and
there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll
eh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal called
while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance
who brought it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle was
there can be no doubt about it your highness
kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up his
seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to
read in his face what preoccupied his own mind
tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in his low aged
voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest
come nearer nearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon
bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
speak quicker quicker dont torture me kutuzov interrupted him
bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent awaiting
instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked
him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and
wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of
the room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there
o lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in a
tremulous voice with folded hands russia is saved i thank thee o
from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
kutuzovs activity was directed toward restraining his troops by
authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers
or encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to malo
yaroslavets but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for
the evacuation of kaluga a retreat beyond which town seemed to him
everywhere kutuzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for his
napoleons historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino
and malo yaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would have
happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his
way the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army for
then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin how
could that army which had found abundant supplies in moscow and had
trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at
smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them how could that
army recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by russians such
as those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same property of
that army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino and
the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it were the
the members of what had once been an army napoleon himself and all his
soldiers fled without knowing whither each concerned only to make his
escape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of
which they were all more or less vaguely conscious
so it came about that at the council at malo yaroslavets when the
generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions all
mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple minded soldier
mouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thing
needful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even
napoleon could say anything against that truth which they all
but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there
still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee an
external shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came in
due time it was what the french called le hourra de lempereur
the day after the council at malo yaroslavets napoleon rode out early in
the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an
escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for
booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the
cossacks did not capture napoleon then what saved him was the very
thing that was destroying the french army the booty on which the
cossacks fell here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving the
men disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon
when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself
in the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it but
to fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleon
with his forty year old stomach understood that hint not feeling his
former agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright the
cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued orders
as the historians tell us to retreat by the smolensk road
that napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated does not
prove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces which
influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is
the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also
a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to go
a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
end of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a promised
the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow
during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was
too far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely
necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today i
shall get to a place twenty five miles off where i shall rest and spend
the night and during the first days journey that resting place
eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and
the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd
for the french retreating along the old smolensk road the final goal
their native land was too remote and their immediate goal was
smolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously
intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew that
much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they were
told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself
knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could
give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so
both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and
pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land
coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and
unheard of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the
common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and
supplied them with a certain energy there was another cause binding
them together their great numbers as with the physical law of gravity
their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their
hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation
each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner
to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force
of this common attraction to smolensk their goal drew each of them in
the same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrender
to a company and though the french availed themselves of every
convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the
slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very
numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
russians to stop this movement to which the french were directing all
their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain
limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on
the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
of the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this when the flight
of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined what
konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began
to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to
cut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all
kutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the
case of any commander in chief to prevent an attack
he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the road
losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what
is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the
road from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from his
aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden
bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on
ermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the french
near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two
french corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they
sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope
and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked
trying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to the
attack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousands
but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army
closing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily melting
away to pursue its fatal path to smolensk
the battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed it
and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the
all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in
their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a
direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor
having quarreled with another collects an army fights his enemys
army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men and
subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the
facts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the
statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
is the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase or
decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible
why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation should oblige
that whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the
rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its
rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army
suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated
so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times
and so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to confirm this
rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its
rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the
victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent
but then in 1812 the french gain a victory near moscow moscow is
taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that
ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then
napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of
history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the
hands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battles
after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor
any that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist what
does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of china
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the
historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards
if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event
occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the
life or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of
the period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of borodino to the
expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not
produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest
it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in
the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else
the french historians describing the condition of the french army
before it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army
except the cavalry the artillery and the transport there was no
forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could
remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than
the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their
carts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifest
any heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of such
peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered
let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone
on for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himself
wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his
life throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to
hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who
so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was
at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring to
conceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victory
with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine what
confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel
the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
the cudgel was the russian people those who try to explain the matter
according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any
previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages the
retreats after battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed
retreat the burning of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure of
transports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules
napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing
attitude in moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgel
raised above his head he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and to
the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
the rules as if there were any rules for killing people in spite of
the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules in
spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather
disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
quarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroit
thrust en prime and so on the cudgel of the peoples war was lifted
with all its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting
anyones tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose and
fell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the french
and it is well for a people who do not as the french did in 1813
salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt of
their rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous
conqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules others
have adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the first
cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of
resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and
one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so called
laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed
together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a
national character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing each
other the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked by
stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done
by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus and
people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume that
by so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a war does
not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well known rule
of tactics which is accepted as infallible that rule says that an
attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
guerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringes
this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military
