there is no human history in the world i suppose said don quixote
that has not its ups and downs but more than others such as deal with
chivalry for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous
for all that replied the bachelor there are those who have read the
history who say they would have been glad if the author had left out some
of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on senor don quixote in
thats where the truth of the history comes in said sancho
at the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence
observed don quixote for there is no need of recording events which do
not change or affect the truth of a history if they tend to bring the
hero of it into contempt aeneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as
virgil represents him nor ulysses so wise as homer describes him
that is true said samson but it is one thing to write as a poet
another to write as a historian the poet may describe or sing things
not as they were but as they ought to have been but the historian has
to write them down not as they ought to have been but as they were
without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it
well then said sancho if this senor moor goes in for telling the
truth no doubt among my masters drubbings mine are to be found for
they never took the measure of his worships shoulders without doing the
same for my whole body but i have no right to wonder at that for as my
master himself says the members must share the pain of the head
you are a sly dog sancho said don quixote i faith you have no
want of memory when you choose to remember
if i were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me said sancho my
weals would not let me for they are still fresh on my ribs
hush sancho said don quixote and dont interrupt the bachelor whom
i entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history
and about me said sancho for they say too that i am one of the
what another word catcher said sancho if thats to be the way we
shall not make an end in a lifetime
may god shorten mine sancho returned the bachelor if you are not
the second person in the history and there are even some who would
rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book though there
are some too who say you showed yourself over credulous in believing
there was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by
there is still sunshine on the wall said don quixote and when sancho
is somewhat more advanced in life with the experience that years bring
he will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he is at
by god master said sancho the island that i cannot govern with the
years i have ill not be able to govern with the years of methuselah
the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere i
know not where and not that there is any want of head in me to govern
leave it to god sancho said don quixote for all will be and perhaps
better than you think no leaf on the tree stirs but by gods will
that is true said samson and if it be gods will there will not be
any want of a thousand islands much less one for sancho to govern
i have seen governors in these parts said sancho that are not to be
compared to my shoe sole and for all that they are called your
those are not governors of islands observed samson but of other
governments of an easier kind those that govern islands must at least
i could manage the gram well enough said sancho but for the mar i
have neither leaning nor liking for i dont know what it is but leaving
this matter of the government in gods hands to send me wherever it may
be most to his service i may tell you senor bachelor samson carrasco
it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of this history should
have spoken of me in such a way that what is said of me gives no offence
for on the faith of a true squire if he had said anything about me that
was at all unbecoming an old christian such as i am the deaf would have
miracles or no miracles said sancho let everyone mind how he speaks
or writes about people and not set down at random the first thing that
one of the faults they find with this history said the bachelor is
that its author inserted in it a novel called the ill advised
curiosity not that it is bad or ill told but that it is out of place
and has nothing to do with the history of his worship senor don quixote
i will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets
then i say said don quixote the author of my history was no sage
but some ignorant chatterer who in a haphazard and heedless way set
about writing it let it turn out as it might just as orbaneja the
painter of ubeda used to do who when they asked him what he was
painting answered what it may turn out sometimes he would paint a
cock in such a fashion and so unlike that he had to write alongside of
it in gothic letters this is a cock and so it will be with my history
which will require a commentary to make it intelligible
no fear of that returned samson for it is so plain that there is
nothing in it to puzzle over the children turn its leaves the young
people read it the grown men understand it the old folk praise it in a
word it is so thumbed and read and got by heart by people of all
sorts that the instant they see any lean hack they say there goes
rocinante and those that are most given to reading it are the pages
for there is not a lords ante chamber where there is not a don quixote
to be found one takes it up if another lays it down this one pounces
upon it and that begs for it in short the said history is the most
delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen
for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an
immodest word or a thought that is other than catholic
to write in any other way said don quixote would not be to write
truth but falsehood and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought
to be burned like those who coin false money and i know not what could
have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories
when he had so much to write about in mine no doubt he must have gone by
the proverb with straw or with hay etc for by merely setting forth my
thoughts my sighs my tears my lofty purposes my enterprises he might
have made a volume as large or larger than all the works of el tostado
would make up in fact the conclusion i arrive at senor bachelor is
that to write histories or books of any kind there is need of great
judgment and a ripe understanding to give expression to humour and
write in a strain of graceful pleasantry is the gift of great geniuses
the cleverest character in comedy is the clown for he who would make
people take him for a fool must not be one history is in a measure a
sacred thing for it should be true and where the truth is there god
is but notwithstanding this there are some who write and fling books
broadcast on the world as if they were fritters
there is no book so bad but it has something good in it said the
no doubt of that replied don quixote but it often happens that those
who have acquired and attained a well deserved reputation by their
writings lose it entirely or damage it in some degree when they give
the reason of that said samson is that as printed works are
examined leisurely their faults are easily seen and the greater the
fame of the writer the more closely are they scrutinised men famous for
their genius great poets illustrious historians are always or most
commonly envied by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in
criticising the writings of others without having produced any of their
that is no wonder said don quixote for there are many divines who
are no good for the pulpit but excellent in detecting the defects or
all that is true senor don quixote said carrasco but i wish such
fault finders were more lenient and less exacting and did not pay so
much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble
at for if aliquando bonus dormitat homerus they should remember how
long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade
as possible and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be
moles that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them
and so i say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes
himself for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that
that which treats of me must have pleased few said don quixote
quite the contrary said the bachelor for as stultorum infinitum est
numerus innumerable are those who have relished the said history but
some have brought a charge against the authors memory inasmuch as he
forgot to say who the thief was who stole sanchos dapple for it is not
stated there but only to be inferred from what is set down that he was
stolen and a little farther on we see sancho mounted on the same ass
without any reappearance of it they say too that he forgot to state
what sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise in
the sierra morena as he never alludes to them again and there are many
who would be glad to know what he did with them or what he spent them
on for it is one of the serious omissions of the work
senor samson i am not in a humour now for going into accounts or
explanations said sancho for theres a sinking of the stomach come
over me and unless i doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff it
will put me on the thorn of santa lucia i have it at home and my old
woman is waiting for me after dinner ill come back and will answer you
and all the world every question you may choose to ask as well about the
loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns and without
another word or waiting for a reply he made off home
don quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with
him the bachelor accepted the invitation and remained a couple of young
pigeons were added to the ordinary fare at dinner they talked chivalry
carrasco fell in with his hosts humour the banquet came to an end they
took their afternoon sleep sancho returned and their conversation was
in which sancho panza gives a satisfactory reply to the doubts and
questions of the bachelor samson carrasco together with other matters
sancho came back to don quixotes house and returning to the late
subject of conversation he said as to what senor samson said that he
would like to know by whom or how or when my ass was stolen i say in
reply that the same night we went into the sierra morena flying from the
holy brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley slaves and
the other of the corpse that was going to segovia my master and i
ensconced ourselves in a thicket and there my master leaning on his
lance and i seated on my dapple battered and weary with the late frays
we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses and i in
particular slept so sound that whoever he was he was able to come and
prop me up on four stakes which he put under the four corners of the
pack saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it and took away
dapple from under me without my feeling it
that is an easy matter said don quixote and it is no new occurrence
for the same thing happened to sacripante at the siege of albracca the
famous thief brunello by the same contrivance took his horse from
day came continued sancho and the moment i stirred the stakes gave
way and i fell to the ground with a mighty come down i looked about for
the ass but could not see him the tears rushed to my eyes and i raised
such a lamentation that if the author of our history has not put it in
he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing some days after i
know not how many travelling with her ladyship the princess micomicona
i saw my ass and mounted upon him in the dress of a gipsy was that
gines de pasamonte the great rogue and rascal that my master and i freed
that is not where the mistake is replied samson it is that before
the ass has turned up the author speaks of sancho as being mounted on
i dont know what to say to that said sancho unless that the
historian made a mistake or perhaps it might be a blunder of the
no doubt thats it said samson but what became of the hundred
to which sancho answered i spent them for my own good and my wifes
and my childrens and it is they that have made my wife bear so
patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways in the service of my
master don quixote for if after all this time i had come back to the
house without a rap and without the ass it would have been a poor
look out for me and if anyone wants to know anything more about me here
i am ready to answer the king himself in person and it is no affair of
anyones whether i took or did not take whether i spent or did not
spend for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be
paid for in money even if they were valued at no more than four
maravedis apiece another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of
them let each look to himself and not try to make out white black and
black white for each of us is as god made him aye and often worse
i will take care said carrasco to impress upon the author of the
history that if he prints it again he must not forget what worthy
sancho has said for it will raise it a good span higher
is there anything else to correct in the history senor bachelor asked
no doubt there is replied he but not anything that will be of the
does the author promise a second part at all said don quixote
he does promise one replied samson but he says he has not found it
nor does he know who has got it and we cannot say whether it will appear
or not and so on that head as some say that no second part has ever
been good and others that enough has been already written about don
quixote it is thought there will be no second part though some who are
jovial rather than saturnine say let us have more quixotades let don
quixote charge and sancho chatter and no matter what it may turn out we
and what does the author mean to do said don quixote
what replied samson why as soon as he has found the history which
he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence he will at once
give it to the press moved more by the profit that may accrue to him
from doing so than by any thought of praise
whereat sancho observed the author looks for money and profit does he
it will be a wonder if he succeeds for it will be only hurry hurry
with him like the tailor on easter eve and works done in a hurry are
never finished as perfectly as they ought to be let master moor or
whatever he is pay attention to what he is doing and i and my master
will give him as much grouting ready to his hand in the way of
adventures and accidents of all sorts as would make up not only one
second part but a hundred the good man fancies no doubt that we are
fast asleep in the straw here but let him hold up our feet to be shod
and he will see which foot it is we go lame on all i say is that if my
master would take my advice we would be now afield redressing outrages
and righting wrongs as is the use and custom of good knights errant
sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of rocinante fell
upon their ears which neighing don quixote accepted as a happy omen and
he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time
announcing his intention to the bachelor he asked his advice as to the
quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition and the bachelor
replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of aragon and
the city of saragossa where there were to be certain solemn joustings at
the festival of st george at which he might win renown above all the
knights of aragon which would be winning it above all the knights of the
world he commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution but
admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers
because his life did not belong to him but to all those who had need of
him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes
theres where it is what i abominate senor samson said sancho here
my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a
dozen melons body of the world senor bachelor there is a time to
attack and a time to retreat and it is not to be always santiago and
close spain moreover i have heard it said and i think by my master
himself if i remember rightly that the mean of valour lies between the
extremes of cowardice and rashness and if that be so i dont want him
to fly without having good reason or to attack when the odds make it
better not but above all things i warn my master that if he is to take
me with him it must be on the condition that he is to do all the
fighting and that i am not to be called upon to do anything except what
concerns keeping him clean and comfortable in this i will dance
attendance on him readily but to expect me to draw sword even against
rascally churls of the hatchet and hood is idle i dont set up to be a
fighting man senor samson but only the best and most loyal squire that
ever served knight errant and if my master don quixote in consideration
of my many faithful services is pleased to give me some island of the
many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts i will take it
as a great favour and if he does not give it to me i was born like
everyone else and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except
god and what is more my bread will taste as well and perhaps even
better without a government than if i were a governor and how do i know
but that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for
me to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out sancho
i was born and sancho i mean to die but for all that if heaven were to
make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind without
much trouble and without much risk i am not such a fool as to refuse it
for they say too when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter and
when good luck comes to thee take it in
brother sancho said carrasco you have spoken like a professor but
for all that put your trust in god and in senor don quixote for he will
give you a kingdom not to say an island
it is all the same be it more or be it less replied sancho though i
can tell senor carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he
might give me into a sack all in holes for i have felt my own pulse and
i find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands and i
have before now told my master as much
take care sancho said samson honours change manners and perhaps
when you find yourself a governor you wont know the mother that bore
that may hold good of those that are born in the ditches said sancho
not of those who have the fat of an old christian four fingers deep on
their souls as i have nay only look at my disposition is that likely
god grant it said don quixote we shall see when the government
comes and i seem to see it already
he then begged the bachelor if he were a poet to do him the favour of
composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of
his lady dulcinea del toboso and to see that a letter of her name was
placed at the beginning of each line so that at the end of the verses
dulcinea del toboso might be read by putting together the first
letters the bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous
poets of spain who were they said only three and a half he would not
fail to compose the required verses though he saw a great difficulty in
the task as the letters which made up the name were seventeen so if he
made four ballad stanzas of four lines each there would be a letter
over and if he made them of five what they called decimas or
redondillas there were three letters short nevertheless he would try to
drop a letter as well as he could so that the name dulcinea del toboso
it must be by some means or other said don quixote for unless the
name stands there plain and manifest no woman would believe the verses
they agreed upon this and that the departure should take place in three
days from that time don quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a
secret especially from the curate and master nicholas and from his
niece and the housekeeper lest they should prevent the execution of his
praiseworthy and valiant purpose carrasco promised all and then took
his leave charging don quixote to inform him of his good or evil
fortunes whenever he had an opportunity and thus they bade each other
farewell and sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for
of the shrewd and droll conversation that passed between sancho panza and
his wife teresa panza and other matters worthy of being duly recorded
the translator of this history when he comes to write this fifth
chapter says that he considers it apocryphal because in it sancho panza
speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his
limited intelligence and says things so subtle that he does not think it
possible he could have conceived them however desirous of doing what
his task imposed upon him he was unwilling to leave it untranslated and
sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his
happiness a bowshot off so much so that it made her ask him what have
you got sancho friend that you are so glad
to which he replied wife if it were gods will i should be very glad
not to be so well pleased as i show myself
i dont understand you husband said she and i dont know what you
mean by saying you would be glad if it were gods will not to be well
pleased for fool as i am i dont know how one can find pleasure in not
hark ye teresa replied sancho i am glad because i have made up my
mind to go back to the service of my master don quixote who means to go
out a third time to seek for adventures and i am going with him again
for my necessities will have it so and also the hope that cheers me with
the thought that i may find another hundred crowns like those we have
spent though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children and
if god would be pleased to let me have my daily bread dry shod and at
home without taking me out into the byways and cross roads and he could
do it at small cost by merely willing it it is clear my happiness would
be more solid and lasting for the happiness i have is mingled with
sorrow at leaving thee so that i was right in saying i would be glad if
it were gods will not to be well pleased
look here sancho said teresa ever since you joined on to a
knight errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no
it is enough that god understands me wife replied sancho for he is
the understander of all things that will do but mind sister you must
look to dapple carefully for the next three days so that he may be fit
to take arms double his feed and see to the pack saddle and other
harness for it is not to a wedding we are bound but to go round the
world and play at give and take with giants and dragons and monsters
and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings and even all
this would be lavender if we had not to reckon with yanguesans and
i know well enough husband said teresa that squires errant dont
eat their bread for nothing and so i will be always praying to our lord
to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune
i can tell you wife said sancho if i did not expect to see myself
governor of an island before long i would drop down dead on the spot
nay then husband said teresa let the hen live though it be with
her pip live and let the devil take all the governments in the world
you came out of your mothers womb without a government you have lived
until now without a government and when it is gods will you will go or
be carried to your grave without a government how many there are in the
world who live without a government and continue to live all the same
and are reckoned in the number of the people the best sauce in the world
is hunger and as the poor are never without that they always eat with a
relish but mind sancho if by good luck you should find yourself with
some government dont forget me and your children remember that
sanchico is now full fifteen and it is right he should go to school if
his uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained for the church
consider too that your daughter mari sancha will not die of grief if we
marry her for i have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a husband
as you to get a government and after all a daughter looks better ill
by my faith replied sancho if god brings me to get any sort of a
government i intend wife to make such a high match for mari sancha
that there will be no approaching her without calling her my lady
nay sancho returned teresa marry her to her equal that is the
safest plan for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high heeled
shoes out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns out
of the plain marica and thou into dona so and so and my lady
the girl wont know where she is and at every turn she will fall into a
thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun
tut you fool said sancho it will be only to practise it for two or
three years and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily as a
glove and if not what matter let her he my lady and never mind what
keep to your own station sancho replied teresa dont try to raise
yourself higher and bear in mind the proverb that says wipe the nose
of your neigbbours son and take him into your house a fine thing it
would be indeed to marry our maria to some great count or grand
gentleman who when the humour took him would abuse her and call her
clown bred and clodhoppers daughter and spinning wench i have not been
bringing up my daughter for that all this time i can tell you husband
do you bring home money sancho and leave marrying her to my care there
is lope tocho juan tochos son a stout sturdy young fellow that we
know and i can see he does not look sour at the girl and with him one
of our own sort she will be well married and we shall have her always
under our eyes and be all one family parents and children
grandchildren and sons in law and the peace and blessing of god will
dwell among us so dont you go marrying her in those courts and grand
palaces where they wont know what to make of her or she what to make of
why you idiot and wife for barabbas said sancho what do you mean by
trying without why or wherefore to keep me from marrying my daughter to
one who will give me grandchildren that will be called your lordship
look ye teresa i have always heard my elders say that he who does not
know how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him has no right to
complain if it gives him the go by and now that it is knocking at our
door it will not do to shut it out let us go with the favouring breeze
it is this sort of talk and what sancho says lower down that made the
translator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal
dont you see you animal continued sancho that it will be well for
me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the
mire and marry mari sancha to whom i like and you yourself will find
yourself called dona teresa panza and sitting in church on a fine
carpet and cushions and draperies in spite and in defiance of all the
born ladies of the town no stay as you are growing neither greater nor
less like a tapestry figure let us say no more about it for sanchica
shall be a countess say what you will
are you sure of all you say husband replied teresa well for all
that i am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin
you do as you like make a duchess or a princess of her but i can tell
you it will not be with my will and consent i was always a lover of
equality brother and i cant bear to see people give themselves airs
without any right they called me teresa at my baptism a plain simple
name without any additions or tags or fringes of dons or donas cascajo
was my fathers name and as i am your wife i am called teresa panza
though by right i ought to be called teresa cascajo but kings go where
laws like and i am content with this name without having the don put
on top of it to make it so heavy that i cannot carry it and i dont want
to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess
or governors wife for they will say at once see what airs the slut
gives herself only yesterday she was always spinning flax and used to
go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of a
mantle and there she goes to day in a hooped gown with her broaches and
airs as if we didnt know her if god keeps me in my seven senses or
five or whatever number i have i am not going to bring myself to such a
pass go you brother and be a government or an island man and swagger
as much as you like for by the soul of my mother neither my daughter
nor i are going to stir a step from our village a respectable woman
should have a broken leg and keep at home and to be busy at something is
a virtuous damsels holiday be off to your adventures along with your
don quixote and leave us to our misadventures for god will mend them
for us according as we deserve it i dont know im sure who fixed the
don to him what neither his father nor grandfather ever had
i declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body said sancho god
help thee what a lot of things thou hast strung together one after the
other without head or tail what have cascajo and the broaches and the
proverbs and the airs to do with what i say look here fool and dolt
for so i may call you when you dont understand my words and run away
from good fortune if i had said that my daughter was to throw herself
down from a tower or go roaming the world as the infanta dona urraca
wanted to do you would be right in not giving way to my will but if in
an instant in less than the twinkling of an eye i put the don and my
lady on her back and take her out of the stubble and place her under a
canopy on a dais and on a couch with more velvet cushions than all the
almohades of morocco ever had in their family why wont you consent and
do you know why husband replied teresa because of the proverb that
says who covers thee discovers thee at the poor man people only throw
a hasty glance on the rich man they fix their eyes and if the said rich
man was once on a time poor it is then there is the sneering and the
tattle and spite of backbiters and in the streets here they swarm as
look here teresa said sancho and listen to what i am now going to
say to you maybe you never heard it in all your life and i do not give
my own notions for what i am about to say are the opinions of his
reverence the preacher who preached in this town last lent and who
said if i remember rightly that all things present that our eyes
behold bring themselves before us and remain and fix themselves on our
memory much better and more forcibly than things past
these observations which sancho makes here are the other ones on account
of which the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal
whence it arises he continued that when we see any person well
dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants
it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him though memory may
at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have
seen him but which whether it may have been poverty or low birth being
now a thing of the past has no existence while the only thing that has
any existence is what we see before us and if this person whom fortune
has raised from his original lowly state these were the very words the
padre used to his present height of prosperity be well bred generous
courteous to all without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of
ancient date depend upon it teresa no one will remember what he was
and everyone will respect what he is except indeed the envious from
i do not understand you husband replied teresa do as you like and
dont break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric and if you
resolved you should say woman said sancho not revolved
dont set yourself to wrangle with me husband said teresa i speak
as god pleases and dont deal in out of the way phrases and i say if
you are bent upon having a government take your son sancho with you and
teach him from this time on how to hold a government for sons ought to
inherit and learn the trades of their fathers
as soon as i have the government said sancho i will send for him by
post and i will send thee money of which i shall have no lack for
there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have
not got it and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him
you send the money said teresa and ill dress him up for you as fine
then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess said sancho
the day that i see her a countess replied teresa it will be the same
to me as if i was burying her but once more i say do as you please for
we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands
though they be dogs and with this she began to weep in earnest as if
sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess he
would put it off as long as possible here their conversation came to an
end and sancho went back to see don quixote and make arrangements for
of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one
of the most important chapters in the whole history
while sancho panza and his wife teresa cascajo held the above
irrelevant conversation don quixotes niece and housekeeper were not
idle for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and
master meant to give them the slip the third time and once more betake
himself to his for them ill errant chivalry they strove by all the
means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme but it
was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless
among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to
him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home
and give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit
looking for what they say are called adventures but what i call
misfortunes i shall have to make complaint to god and the king with loud
to which don quixote replied what answer god will give to your
complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer
either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the
numberless silly petitions they present every day for one of the
greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to
all and answer all and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of
whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majestys court
there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right
there should be to set off the dignity of the prince and for the
then might not your worship said she be one of those that without
stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court
recollect my friend said don quixote all knights cannot be
courtiers nor can all courtiers be knights errant nor need they be
there must be all sorts in the world and though we may be all knights
there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers
without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the
world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and
without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst but we the true
knights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the
sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and
night on foot and on horseback nor do we only know enemies in pictures
but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we
attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single
combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword whether one
carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the
sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort
that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing
about but i do and you must know besides that the true knight errant
though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their
heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by
way of legs and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships and each
eye like a great mill wheel and glowing brighter than a glass furnace
must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must
attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart
and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for
armour the shells of a certain fish that they say are harder than
diamonds and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of damascus
steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more
than once seen all this i say housekeeper that you may see the
difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other and it
would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on
this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant
for as we read in their histories there have been some among them who
have been the salvation not merely of one kingdom but of many
ah senor here exclaimed the niece remember that all this you are
saying about knights errant is fable and fiction and their histories if
indeed they were not burned would deserve each of them to have a
sambenito put on it or some mark by which it might be known as infamous
by the god that gives me life said don quixote if thou wert not my
full niece being daughter of my own sister i would inflict a
chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the
world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly
knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and
criticise the histories of knights errant what would senor amadis say if
he heard of such a thing he however no doubt would forgive thee for
he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time and
moreover a great protector of damsels but some there are that might have
heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for
they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned
scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so
in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck and all look like
gentlemen but not all can stand the touchstone of truth there are men
of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen and
high gentlemen who one would fancy were dying to pass for men of low
rank the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues
the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices
and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two
kinds of gentlemen so much alike in name and so different in conduct
god bless me said the niece that you should know so much
uncle enough if need be to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the
streets and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a
folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are
old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked
when you yourself are bent by age and above all a caballero when you
are not one for though gentlefolk may be so poor men are nothing of the
there is a great deal of truth in what you say niece returned don
quixote and i could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish
you but not to mix up things human and divine i refrain look you my
dears all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be
reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings
and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained
surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained
them and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those
again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid
having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to
nought like the point of a pyramid which relatively to its base or
foundation is nothing and then there are those and it is they that are
the most numerous that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a
remarkable mid course and so will have an end without a name like an
ordinary plebeian line of the first those that had an humble origin and
rose to the greatness they still preserve the ottoman house may serve as
an example which from an humble and lowly shepherd its founder has
reached the height at which we now see it for examples of the second
sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without
adding to it there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity
and maintain themselves in their inheritance without increasing or
diminishing it keeping peacefully within the limits of their states of
those that began great and ended in a point there are thousands of
examples for all the pharaohs and ptolemies of egypt the caesars of
rome and the whole herd if i may such a word to them of countless
princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians greeks and
barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and
come to nothing they themselves as well as their founders for it would
be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we
find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian
lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the
number of those that live without any eminence to entitle them to any
fame or praise beyond this from all i have said i would have you gather
my poor innocents that great is the confusion among lineages and that
only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so
by the virtue wealth and generosity of their possessors i have said
virtue wealth and generosity because a great man who is vicious will
be a great example of vice and a rich man who is not generous will be
merely a miserly beggar for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by
possessing it but by spending it and not by spending as he pleases but
by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing
that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred
courteous gentle mannered and kindly not haughty arrogant or
censorious but above all by being charitable for by two maravedis given
with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he
who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to
be endowed with the virtues i have named even though he know him not
will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood and it
would be strange were it not so praise has ever been the reward of
virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation
there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and
honours one is that of letters the other that of arms i have more of
arms than of letters in my composition and judging by my inclination to
arms was born under the influence of the planet mars i am therefore
in a measure constrained to follow that road and by it i must travel in
spite of all the world and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me
to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above
all my own inclination favours for knowing as i do the countless toils
that are the accompaniments of knight errantry i know too the infinite
blessings that are attained by it i know that the path of virtue is very
narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and
goals are different for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death
and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life and not transitory
life but in that which has no end i know as our great castilian poet
it is by rugged paths like these they go
woe is me exclaimed the niece my lord is a poet too he knows
everything and he can do everything i will bet if he chose to turn
mason he could make a house as easily as a cage
i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous
thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i
could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my
at this moment there came a knocking at the door and when they asked who
was there sancho panza made answer that it was he the instant the
housekeeper knew who it was she ran to hide herself so as not to see
him in such abhorrence did she hold him the niece let him in and his
master don quixote came forward to receive him with open arms and the
pair shut themselves up in his room where they had another conversation
of what passed between don quixote and his squire together with other
the instant the housekeeper saw sancho panza shut himself in with her
master she guessed what they were about and suspecting that the result
of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally she
seized her mantle and in deep anxiety and distress ran to find the
bachelor samson carrasco as she thought that being a well spoken man
and a new friend of her masters he might be able to persuade him to
give up any such crazy notion she found him pacing the patio of his
house and perspiring and flurried she fell at his feet the moment she
carrasco seeing how distressed and overcome she was said to her what
is this mistress housekeeper what has happened to you one would think
nothing senor samson said she only that my master is breaking out
whereabouts is he breaking out senora asked samson has any part of
he is only breaking out at the door of his madness she replied i
mean dear senor bachelor that he is going to break out again and this
will be the third time to hunt all over the world for what he calls
ventures though i cant make out why he gives them that name the first
time he was brought back to us slung across the back of an ass and
belaboured all over and the second time he came in an ox cart shut up
in a cage in which he persuaded himself he was enchanted and the poor
creature was in such a state that the mother that bore him would not have
known him lean yellow with his eyes sunk deep in the cells of his
skull so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more
than six hundred eggs as god knows and all the world and my hens too
that i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good
and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for
another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress
housekeeper that is all and there is nothing the matter except what it
well then returned the bachelor dont be uneasy but go home in
peace get me ready something hot for breakfast and while you are on the
way say the prayer of santa apollonia that is if you know it for i will
woe is me cried the housekeeper is it the prayer of santa apollonia
you would have me say that would do if it was the toothache my master
had but it is in the brains what he has got
i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper go and dont set
yourself to argue with me for you know i am a bachelor of salamanca and
one cant be more of a bachelor than that replied carrasco and with
this the housekeeper retired and the bachelor went to look for the
curate and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place
while don quixote and sancho were shut up together they had a discussion
which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness
sancho said to his master senor i have educed my wife to let me go
with your worship wherever you choose to take me
induced you should say sancho said don quixote not educed
once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho i have begged of
your worship not to mend my words if so be as you understand what i mean
by them and if you dont understand them to say sancho or devil i
dont understand thee and if i dont make my meaning plain then you may
i dont understand thee sancho said don quixote at once for i know
so focile means i am so much that way replied sancho
i understand thee still less now said don quixote
well if you cant understand me said sancho i dont know how to put
it i know no more god help me
oh now i have hit it said don quixote thou wouldst say thou art so
docile tractable and gentle that thou wilt take what i say to thee and
i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me
and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear
may be so replied don quixote but to come to the point what does
teresa says replied sancho that i should make sure with your
worship and let papers speak and beards be still for he who binds
does not wrangle since one take is better than two ill give
thees and i say a womans advice is no great thing and he who wont
and so say i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you
the fact is continued sancho that as your worship knows better than
i do we are all of us liable to death and to day we are and to morrow
we are not and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and nobody can
promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased
to give him for death is deaf and when it comes to knock at our lifes
door it is always urgent and neither prayers nor struggles nor
sceptres nor mitres can keep it back as common talk and report say
and as they tell us from the pulpits every day
all that is very true said don quixote but i cannot make out what
what i am driving at said sancho is that your worship settle some
fixed wages for me to be paid monthly while i am in your service and
that the same he paid me out of your estate for i dont care to stand on
rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with
my own in short i would like to know what i am to get be it much or
little for the hen will lay on one egg and many littles make a much
and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost to be sure if
it should happen what i neither believe nor expect that your worship
were to give me that island you have promised me i am not so ungrateful
nor so grasping but that i would be willing to have the revenue of such
island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion
sancho my friend replied don quixote sometimes proportion may be as
i see said sancho ill bet i ought to have said proportion and not
promotion but it is no matter as your worship has understood me
and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into
the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with
the countless shafts of thy proverbs look here sancho i would readily
fix thy wages if i had ever found any instance in the histories of the
knights errant to show or indicate by the slightest hint what their
squires used to get monthly or yearly but i have read all or the best
part of their histories and i cannot remember reading of any
knight errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire i only know that
they all served on reward and that when they least expected it if good
luck attended their masters they found themselves recompensed with an
island or something equivalent to it or at the least they were left with
a title and lordship if with these hopes and additional inducements you
sancho please to return to my service well and good but to suppose
that i am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of
knight errantry is all nonsense and so my sancho get you back to your
