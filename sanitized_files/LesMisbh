marius indulged in melancholy conjectures he dared not watch the porte
cochere during the day he contented himself with going at night to gaze
upon the red light of the windows at times he saw shadows flit across
on the eighth day when he arrived under the windows there was no light
hello he said the lamp is not lighted yet but it is dark can they
have gone out he waited until ten oclock until midnight until one
in the morning not a light appeared in the windows of the third story
he went away in a very gloomy frame of mind
on the morrow for he only existed from morrow to morrow there was
so to speak no to day for him on the morrow he found no one at the
luxembourg he had expected this at dusk he went to the house
no light in the windows the shades were drawn the third floor was
marius rapped at the porte cochere entered and said to the porter
so he has not left his new address
and the porter raising his eyes recognized marius
come so its you said he but you are decidedly a spy then
human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance a third
lower floor the social soil is everywhere undermined sometimes for
good sometimes for evil these works are superposed one upon the other
there are superior mines and inferior mines there is a top and a
bottom in this obscure sub soil which sometimes gives way beneath
civilization and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under
foot the encyclopedia in the last century was a mine that was
almost open to the sky the shades those sombre hatchers of primitive
christianity only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion
under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light for in the
sacred shadows there lies latent light volcanoes are full of a shadow
that is capable of flashing forth every form begins by being night the
catacombs in which the first mass was said were not alone the cellar
of rome they were the vaults of the world
beneath the social construction that complicated marvel of a structure
there are excavations of all sorts there is the religious mine the
philosophical mine the economic mine the revolutionary mine such and
such a pick axe with the idea such a pick with ciphers such another
with wrath people hail and answer each other from one catacomb to
another utopias travel about underground in the pipes there they
branch out in every direction they sometimes meet and fraternize
there jean jacques lends his pick to diogenes who lends him his
lantern sometimes they enter into combat there calvin seizes socinius
by the hair but nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these
energies toward the goal and the vast simultaneous activity which
goes and comes mounts descends and mounts again in these obscurities
and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the
bottom and the inside and the outside society hardly even suspects this
digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels there
are as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works
as there are extractions what emerges from these deep excavations the
the deeper one goes the more mysterious are the toilers the work
is good up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to
recognize beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed lower down
it becomes terrible at a certain depth the excavations are no longer
penetrable by the spirit of civilization the limit breathable by man
has been passed a beginning of monsters is possible
the descending scale is a strange one and each one of the rungs of this
ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold and
where one encounters one of these workmen sometimes divine sometimes
misshapen below john huss there is luther below luther there is
descartes below descartes there is voltaire below voltaire there
is condorcet below condorcet there is robespierre below robespierre
there is marat below marat there is babeuf and so it goes on lower
down confusedly at the limit which separates the indistinct from the
invisible one perceives other gloomy men who perhaps do not exist as
yet the men of yesterday are spectres those of to morrow are forms
the eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely the embryonic
work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy
a world in limbo in the state of foetus what an unheard of spectre
saint simon owen fourier are there also in lateral galleries
surely although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves
binds together all these subterranean pioneers who almost always think
themselves isolated and who are not so their works vary greatly and
the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others the first are
paradisiacal the last are tragic nevertheless whatever may be the
contrast all these toilers from the highest to the most nocturnal
from the wisest to the most foolish possess one likeness and this
is it disinterestedness marat forgets himself like jesus they
throw themselves on one side they omit themselves they think not of
themselves they have a glance and that glance seeks the absolute the
first has the whole heavens in his eyes the last enigmatical though he
may be has still beneath his eyelids the pale beam of the infinite
venerate the man whoever he may be who has this sign the starry eye
with it evil commences reflect and tremble in the presence of any one
who has no glance at all the social order has its black miners
there is a point where depth is tantamount to burial and where light
below all these mines which we have just mentioned below all these
galleries below this whole immense subterranean venous system of
progress and utopia much further on in the earth much lower than
marat lower than babeuf lower much lower and without any connection
with the upper levels there lies the last mine a formidable spot this
is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous it is the grave
of shadows it is the cellar of the blind inferi
there disinterestedness vanishes the demon is vaguely outlined each
one is for himself the i in the eyes howls seeks fumbles and
gnaws the social ugolino is in this gulf
the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost
phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant
both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything
but the satisfaction of their individual desires they are almost
unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible
obliteration they have two mothers both step mothers ignorance and
misery they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfaction
appetite they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not
after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger
from suffering these spectres pass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy
creation logic of darkness that which crawls in the social third lower
level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest
of matter man there becomes a dragon to be hungry to be thirsty that
is the point of departure to be satan that is the point reached from
we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the
upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical
excavation there as we have just said all is pure noble dignified
honest there assuredly one might be misled but error is worthy of
veneration there so thoroughly does it imply heroism the work there
effected taken as a whole has a name progress
the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths
hideous depths there exists beneath society we insist upon this point
and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated
this cavern is below all and is the foe of all it is hatred without
exception this cavern knows no philosophers its dagger has never cut
a pen its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the
inkstand never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this
stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper
babeuf is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to
schinderhannes this cavern has for its object the destruction of
of everything including the upper superior mines which it execrates
it not only undermines in its hideous swarming the actual social
order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it
progress its name is simply theft prostitution murder assassination
it is darkness and it desires chaos its vault is formed of ignorance
all the others those above it have but one object to suppress it
it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their
organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by
their contemplation of the absolute destroy the cavern ignorance and
let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written
humanity is identity all men are made of the same clay there is no
difference here below at least in predestination the same shadow
in front the same flesh in the present the same ashes afterwards but
ignorance mingled with the human paste blackens it this incurable
blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there
a quartette of ruffians claquesous gueulemer babet and montparnasse
governed the third lower floor of paris from 1830 to 1835
gueulemer was a hercules of no defined position for his lair he had the
sewer of the arche marion he was six feet high his pectoral muscles
were of marble his biceps of brass his breath was that of a cavern
his torso that of a colossus his head that of a bird one thought one
beheld the farnese hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet
waistcoat gueulemer built after this sculptural fashion might have
subdued monsters he had found it more expeditious to be one a low
brow large temples less than forty years of age but with crows feet
harsh short hair cheeks like a brush a beard like that of a wild
boar the reader can see the man before him his muscles called for
work his stupidity would have none of it he was a great idle force
he was an assassin through coolness he was thought to be a creole he
had probably somewhat to do with marshal brune having been a porter
at avignon in 1815 after this stage he had turned ruffian
the diaphaneity of babet contrasted with the grossness of gueulemer
babet was thin and learned he was transparent but impenetrable
daylight was visible through his bones but nothing through his eyes he
declared that he was a chemist he had been a jack of all trades he had
played in vaudeville at saint mihiel he was a man of purpose a fine
talker who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures his
occupation consisted in selling in the open air plaster busts and
portraits of the head of the state in addition to this he extracted
teeth he had exhibited phenomena at fairs and he had owned a booth
with a trumpet and this poster babet dental artist member of the
academies makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids extracts
teeth undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners price
one tooth one franc fifty centimes two teeth two francs three
teeth two francs fifty take advantage of this opportunity this take
advantage of this opportunity meant have as many teeth extracted as
possible he had been married and had had children he did not know what
had become of his wife and children he had lost them as one loses his
handkerchief babet read the papers a striking exception in the world
to which he belonged one day at the period when he had his family with
him in his booth on wheels he had read in the messager that a woman
had just given birth to a child who was doing well and had a calfs
muzzle and he exclaimed theres a fortune my wife has not the wit to
later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris
who was claquesous he was night he waited until the sky was daubed
with black before he showed himself at nightfall he emerged from the
hole whither he returned before daylight where was this hole no one
knew he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness
and with his back turned to them was his name claquesous certainly
not if a candle was brought he put on a mask he was a ventriloquist
babet said claquesous is a nocturne for two voices claquesous was
vague terrible and a roamer no one was sure whether he had a name
claquesous being a sobriquet none was sure that he had a voice as his
stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he
had a face as he was never seen without his mask he disappeared as
though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though
a lugubrious being was montparnasse montparnasse was a child less than
twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like cherries charming
black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all
the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse it was the
street boy turned pickpocket and a pickpocket turned garroter he was
genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious the rim of
his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft
of hair after the style of 1829 he lived by robbery with violence
his coat was of the best cut but threadbare montparnasse was a
fashion plate in misery and given to the commission of murders the
cause of all this youths crimes was the desire to be well dressed the
first grisette who had said to him you are handsome had cast the
stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel
finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant now the
height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime few
prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse at eighteen he had already
numerous corpses in his past more than one passer by lay with
outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a
pool of blood curled pomaded with laced waist the hips of a woman
the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the
boulevard wenches surrounding him his cravat knowingly tied a bludgeon
in his pocket a flower in his buttonhole such was this dandy of the
these four ruffians formed a sort of proteus winding like a serpent
among the police and striving to escape vidocqs indiscreet glances
under divers forms tree flame fountain lending each other their
names and their traps hiding in their own shadows boxes with
secret compartments and refuges for each other stripping off their
personalities as one removes his false nose at a masked ball sometimes
simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual
sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that coco latour
these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterious robber
with four heads operating on a grand scale on paris they were that
monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society
thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their
relations babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse were charged
with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of
the seine the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal
imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed they
furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the
preparation of the scenery they labored at the stage setting they were
always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to
all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were
sufficiently lucrative when a crime was in quest of arms they
under let their accomplices they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows
they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they
woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere there they held
their conferences they had twelve black hours before them they
patron minette such was the name which was bestowed in the
subterranean circulation on the association of these four men in the
fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day
patron minette signifies the morning the same as entre chien et
loup between dog and wolf signifies the evening this appellation
patron minette was probably derived from the hour at which their work
ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the
separation of ruffians these four men were known under this title
when the president of the assizes visited lacenaire in his prison and
questioned him concerning a misdeed which lacenaire denied who did
it demanded the president lacenaire made this response enigmatical
so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police
a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages
in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians
composing it here are the appellations to which the principal members
of patron minette answered for the names have survived in special
brujon there was a brujon dynasty we cannot refrain from
les pieds en lair feet in the air
we pass over some and not the worst of them these names have faces
attached they do not express merely beings but species each one of
these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the
those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not
among the men whom one sees passing along the streets fatigued by the
wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes
in the lime kilns sometimes in the abandoned quarries of montmatre or
montrouge sometimes in the sewers they ran to earth
what became of these men they still exist they have always existed
horace speaks of them ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici
mimae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what
they are beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually
born again from the social ooze they return spectres but always
identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are
no longer in the same skins the individuals extirpated the tribe
they always have the same faculties from the vagrant to the tramp the
race is maintained in its purity they divine purses in pockets they
scent out watches in fobs gold and silver possess an odor for them
there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they
have a stealable air these men patiently pursue these bourgeois they
experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a
these men are terrible when one encounters them or catches a glimpse
of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard they do not seem
to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they
habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in
no wise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the
darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living
for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the
what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish light light in
floods not a single bat can resist the dawn light up society from
chapter i marius while seeking a girl in a bonnet encounters a man in
summer passed then the autumn winter came neither m leblanc nor the
young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden thenceforth
marius had but one thought to gaze once more on that sweet and
adorable face he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found
nothing he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm
resolute ardent man the bold defier of fate the brain which erected
future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects
with pride with ideas and wishes he was a lost dog he fell into a
black melancholy all was over work disgusted him walking tired him
vast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels
perspectives horizons teachings now lay empty before him it seemed
he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise but he no longer
took pleasure in his thoughts to everything that they proposed to him
in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use
he heaped a hundred reproaches on himself why did i follow her i
was so happy at the mere sight of her she looked at me was not that
immense she had the air of loving me was not that everything i wished
to have what there was nothing after that i have been absurd it is
my own fault etc etc courfeyrac to whom he confided nothing it
was his nature but who made some little guess at everything that was
his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he
was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state
he ended by saying to him i see that you have been simply an animal
once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed
himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac bossuet and
grantaire hoping what a dream that he might perhaps find her there
of course he did not see the one he sought but this is the place
all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grantaire in an
aside marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot
alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes
stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing
creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to
him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the
walnut trees along the road in order to refresh his head
he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given
up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in
the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love
on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a
singular effect he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the
boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a
cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very
white hair marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and
scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in
painful meditation strange to say he thought that he recognized m
leblanc the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap
permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed but why
these workingmans clothes what was the meaning of this what signified
that disguise marius was greatly astonished when he recovered himself
his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not
hold at last the clue which he was seeking in any case he must see the
man near at hand and clear up the mystery but the idea occurred to him
too late the man was no longer there he had turned into some little
side street and marius could not find him this encounter occupied
his mind for three days and then was effaced after all he said to
marius had not left the gorbeau house he paid no attention to any one
at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the
house except himself and those jondrettes whose rent he had once paid
without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or
daughters the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been
one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the
afternoon but it was the 2d of february that ancient candlemas
day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks cold spell
inspired mathieu laensberg with these two lines which have with justice
marius had just emerged from his night was falling it was the hour for
his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again alas oh
he had just crossed his threshold where maam bougon was sweeping at
the moment as she uttered this memorable monologue
what is there that is cheap now everything is dear there is nothing
in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing
marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to
reach the rue saint jacques he was walking along with drooping head
all at once he felt some one elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round
and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other a
little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror
and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him
had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed through the
twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads
their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats
and their bare feet they were talking as they ran the taller said in a
the bobbies have come they came near nabbing me at the half circle
the other answered i saw them i bolted bolted bolted
through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes or the
police had come near apprehending these two children and that the
they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there
created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot
he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish
package lying on the ground at his feet he stooped and picked it up it
was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers
good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it
he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected
that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and
on the way he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard a childs coffin
covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a
candle the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind
poor mothers he thought there is one thing sadder than to see ones
children die it is to see them leading an evil life
then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his
thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations
he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness
in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of
how gloomy my life has become he said to himself young girls are
always appearing to me only formerly they were angels and now they are
that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand
came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he
had picked up on the boulevard he had forgotten it he thought that it
would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain
the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in
any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who
it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed
all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco
the first was addressed to madame madame la marquise de grucheray
the place opposite the chamber of deputies no 
marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the
information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open
it was probable that it could be read without impropriety
madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most
closely unites sosiety turn your christian spirit and cast a look of
compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment
to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood
consecrated his fortune evverything to defend that cause and to day
finds himself in the greatest missery he doubts not that your honorable
person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for
a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance
on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which madame la
marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate their prayer will not be in
vain and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir
my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be
no address was joined to the signature marius hoped to find the address
in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la
comtesse de montvernet rue cassette no 9 this is what marius read in
madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six
children the last of which is only eight months old i sick
since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago
haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance
in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be
marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the
rue saint denis on the corner of the rue aux fers
i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me
the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man
of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatre francais the subject
is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time
of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have
some merit there are couplets to be sung in four places the comic
the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters
and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue
which proceeds misteriously and ends after striking altarations
in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes
my principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively
animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion
that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost
in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy
the egotism of priviliged authors may obtaine my exclusion from
the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which
monsiuer pabourgeot your just reputation as an enlightened protector
of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will
explain our indigant situation to you lacking bread and fire
in this wynter season when i say to you that i beg you to accept
the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all
those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition
to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection
and of adorning my writings with your name if you deign to honor
me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself
in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude
which i shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible
will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the
p s even if it is only forty sous
excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself
but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me
finally marius opened the fourth letter the address ran to the
benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas it
benevolent man if you deign to accompany my daughter you will
behold a misserable calamity and i will show you my certificates
at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved
with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers
admit compassionate man that it is necessary to suffer the most
cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining
a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though
one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting
to have our misery relieved destinies are very fatal for several
and too prodigal or too protecting for others
i await your presence or your offering if you deign to make one
and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i
after perusing these four letters marius did not find himself much
in the first place not one of the signers gave his address
then they seemed to come from four different individuals don alveras
mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramatic artist fabantou but
the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written
what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come
moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the
coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four the odor of tobacco
was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the
style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest
tranquillity and the man of letters genflot was no more exempt from
it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery had it not
been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification
marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to
lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous
of playing with him it seemed to him that he was playing the part of
the blind man in blind mans buff between the four letters and that
nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two
young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard after all they were
evidently papers of no value marius replaced them in their envelope
flung the whole into a corner and went to bed about seven oclock in
the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and was trying to settle
down to work when there came a soft knock at his door
as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally
though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work even when
absent he left his key in the lock you will be robbed said maam
bougon of what said marius the truth is however that he had one
day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of maam
there came a second knock as gentle as the first
what do you want maam bougon asked marius without raising his eyes
from the books and manuscripts on his table
a voice which did not belong to maam bougon replied
it was a dull broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man
marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl
illustration rose in misery 3b8 4 rose in misery
a very young girl was standing in the half open door the dormer window
of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite
the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light she was a frail
emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a
petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a
string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her
chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor earth colored collar bones red
hands a half open and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base
eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the
look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of
those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those
to shudder whom they do not cause to weep
marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who
was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams
the most heart breaking thing of all was that this young girl had not
come into the world to be homely in her early childhood she must even
have been pretty the grace of her age was still struggling against the
hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty the remains of
beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight
which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winters day
that face was not wholly unknown to marius he thought he remembered
the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict
here is a letter for you monsieur marius
she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person
whom she wanted but who was this girl how did she know his name
without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered she entered
resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed
at the whole room and the unmade bed her feet were bare large holes
in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees
she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius
marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which
sealed it was still moist the message could not have come from a
my amiable neighbor young man i have learned of your goodness to me
that you paid my rent six months ago i bless you young man
my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel
of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill if i am
not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous
heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you
to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor
i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the
ps my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius
this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which
had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like
a candle in a cellar all was suddenly illuminated
this letter came from the same place as the other four there was the
same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the
there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single
signer the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard
the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four
named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were named jondrette
marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had
as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse
of his extremely mean neighbors his mind was elsewhere and where the
mind is there the eyes are also he had been obliged more than once to
pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere
forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding
evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without
recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great
difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in
him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met
now he saw everything clearly he understood that his neighbor
jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the
charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he
wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and
compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk
and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his
daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the
stake marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the
evening before from their breathless condition from their terror
and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate
creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the
result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now
constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a
species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery
sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor
evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood
have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor
responsibility souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded
to day like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled
with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them
nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the
young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity
of a spectre she kicked about without troubling herself as to her
nakedness occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell
almost to her waist she moved the chairs about she disarranged the
toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes
she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners
and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone
frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered
an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible
nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room
and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened
by the daylight or which has broken its wing one felt that under other
conditions of education and destiny the gay and over free mien of this
young girl might have turned out sweet and charming never even among
animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey that
marius reflected and allowed her to have her way
a flash pierced her glassy eye she resumed and her accent expressed
the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human
she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with
 general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont
which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five
ah waterloo i know about that it was a battle long ago my father
was there my father has served in the armies we are fine bonapartists
in our house that we are waterloo was against the english
she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed
she dipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius
do you want to see look here im going to write a word to show you
and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper
which lay in the middle of the table the bobbies are here
there are no faults of orthography you can look we have received an
education my sister and i we have not always been as we are now we
here she paused fixed her dull eyes on marius and burst out laughing
saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish
