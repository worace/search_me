mentioned this lest anybody should mind what sancho said about dulcineas
winnowing or sifting for as they changed her to me it is no wonder if
they changed her to him dulcinea is illustrious and well born and of
one of the gentle families of el toboso which are many ancient and
good therein most assuredly not small is the share of the peerless
dulcinea through whom her town will be famous and celebrated in ages to
come as troy was through helen and spain through la cava though with a
better title and tradition for another thing i would have your graces
understand that sancho panza is one of the drollest squires that ever
served knight errant sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute
that it is an amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or
sharp he has mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue and blundering
ways that prove him a booby he doubts everything and believes
everything when i fancy he is on the point of coming down headlong from
sheer stupidity he comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to
the skies after all i would not exchange him for another squire though
i were given a city to boot and therefore i am in doubt whether it will
be well to send him to the government your highness has bestowed upon
him though i perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of
governing so that with a little trimming of his understanding he would
manage any government as easily as the king does his taxes and moreover
we know already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness
or much learning to be a governor for there are a hundred round about us
that scarcely know how to read and govern like gerfalcons the main
point is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing
right in all things for they will never be at a loss for persons to
advise and direct them in what they have to do like those
knight governors who being no lawyers pronounce sentences with the aid
of an assessor my advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender
no right and i have some other little matters in reserve that shall be
produced in due season for sanchos benefit and the advantage of the
the duke duchess and don quixote had reached this point in their
conversation when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace
and sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger with a
straining cloth by way of a bib and followed by several servants or
more properly speaking kitchen boys and other underlings one of whom
carried a small trough full of water that from its colour and impurity
was plainly dishwater the one with the trough pursued him and followed
him everywhere he went endeavouring with the utmost persistence to
thrust it under his chin while another kitchen boy seemed anxious to
what is all this brothers asked the duchess what is it what do you
want to do to this good man do you forget he is a governor elect
to which the barber kitchen boy replied the gentleman will not let
himself be washed as is customary and as my lord and the senor his
yes i will said sancho in a great rage but id like it to be with
cleaner towels clearer lye and not such dirty hands for theres not so
much difference between me and my master that he should be washed with
angels water and i with devils lye the customs of countries and
princes palaces are only good so long as they give no annoyance but the
way of washing they have here is worse than doing penance i have a clean
beard and i dont require to be refreshed in that fashion and whoever
comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head i mean to say my beard with
all due respect be it said ill give him a punch that will leave my fist
sunk in his skull for cirimonies and soapings of this sort are more like
jokes than the polite attentions of ones host
the duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw sanchos rage and
heard his words but it was no pleasure to don quixote to see him in such
a sorry trim with the dingy towel about him and the hangers on of the
kitchen all round him so making a low bow to the duke and duchess as if
to ask their permission to speak he addressed the rout in a dignified
tone holloa gentlemen you let that youth alone and go back to where
you came from or anywhere else if you like my squire is as clean as any
other person and those troughs are as bad as narrow thin necked jars to
him take my advice and leave him alone for neither he nor i understand
sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on nay let them come
and try their jokes on the country bumpkin for its about as likely ill
stand them as that its now midnight let them bring me a comb here or
what they please and curry this beard of mine and if they get anything
out of it that offends against cleanliness let them clip me to the
upon this the duchess laughing all the while said sancho panza is
right and always will be in all he says he is clean and as he says
himself he does not require to be washed and if our ways do not please
him he is free to choose besides you promoters of cleanliness have
been excessively careless and thoughtless i dont know if i ought not to
say audacious to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen
dishclouts instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of
holland to such a person and such a beard but after all you are
ill conditioned and ill bred and spiteful as you are you cannot help
showing the grudge you have against the squires of knights errant
the impudent servitors and even the seneschal who came with them took
the duchess to be speaking in earnest so they removed the
straining cloth from sanchos neck and with something like shame and
confusion of face went off all of them and left him whereupon he seeing
himself safe out of that extreme danger as it seemed to him ran and
fell on his knees before the duchess saying from great ladies great
favours may be looked for this which your grace has done me today cannot
be requited with less than wishing i was dubbed a knight errant to
devote myself all the days of my life to the service of so exalted a
lady i am a labouring man my name is sancho panza i am married i have
children and i am serving as a squire if in any one of these ways i can
serve your highness i will not be longer in obeying than your grace in
it is easy to see sancho replied the duchess that you have learned
to be polite in the school of politeness itself i mean to say it is easy
to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of senor don quixote who
is of course the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony or
cirimony as you would say yourself fair be the fortunes of such a
master and such a servant the one the cynosure of knight errantry the
other the star of squirely fidelity rise sancho my friend i will
repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to
you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible
with this the conversation came to an end and don quixote retired to
take his midday sleep but the duchess begged sancho unless he had a
very great desire to go to sleep to come and spend the afternoon with
her and her damsels in a very cool chamber sancho replied that though
he certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of
the day in summer to serve her excellence he would try with all his
might not to sleep even one that day and that he would come in obedience
to her command and with that he went off the duke gave fresh orders
with respect to treating don quixote as a knight errant without
departing even in smallest particular from the style in which as the
stories tell us they used to treat the knights of old
of the delectable discourse which the duchess and her damsels held with
the history records that sancho did not sleep that afternoon but in
order to keep his word came before he had well done dinner to visit the
duchess who finding enjoyment in listening to him made him sit down
beside her on a low seat though sancho out of pure good breeding
wanted not to sit down the duchess however told him he was to sit down
as governor and talk as squire as in both respects he was worthy of even
the chair of the cid ruy diaz the campeador sancho shrugged his
shoulders obeyed and sat down and all the duchesss damsels and
duennas gathered round him waiting in profound silence to hear what he
would say it was the duchess however who spoke first saying
now that we are alone and that there is nobody here to overhear us i
should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts i
have rising out of the history of the great don quixote that is now in
print one is inasmuch as worthy sancho never saw dulcinea i mean the
lady dulcinea del toboso nor took don quixotes letter to her for it
was left in the memorandum book in the sierra morena how did he dare to
invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat the whole
story being a deception and falsehood and so much to the prejudice of
the peerless dulcineas good name a thing that is not at all becoming
the character and fidelity of a good squire
at these words sancho without uttering one in reply got up from his
chair and with noiseless steps with his body bent and his finger on his
lips went all round the room lifting up the hangings and this done he
came back to his seat and said now senora that i have seen that there
is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly i will answer
what you have asked me and all you may ask me without fear or dread
and the first thing i have got to say is that for my own part i hold my
master don quixote to be stark mad though sometimes he says things that
to my mind and indeed everybodys that listens to him are so wise and
run in such a straight furrow that satan himself could not have said
them better but for all that really and beyond all question its my
firm belief he is cracked well then as this is clear to my mind i can
venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail like
that affair of the answer to the letter and that other of six or eight
days ago which is not yet in history that is to say the affair of the
enchantment of my lady dulcinea for i made him believe she is enchanted
though theres no more truth in it than over the hills of ubeda
the duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception so
sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened and his hearers
were not a little amused by it and then resuming the duchess said in
consequence of what worthy sancho has told me a doubt starts up in my
mind and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says if don
quixote be mad crazy and cracked and sancho panza his squire knows it
and notwithstanding serves and follows him and goes trusting to his
empty promises there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier
than his master and that being so it will be cast in your teeth senora
duchess if you give the said sancho an island to govern for how will he
who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others
by god senora said sancho but that doubt comes timely but your
grace may say it out and speak plainly or as you like for i know what
you say is true and if i were wise i should have left my master long
ago but this was my fate this was my bad luck i cant help it i must
follow him were from the same village ive eaten his bread im fond
of him im grateful he gave me his ass colts and above all im
faithful so its quite impossible for anything to separate us except
the pickaxe and shovel and if your highness does not like to give me the
government you promised god made me without it and maybe your not
giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience for fool as i
am i know the proverb to her hurt the ant got wings and it may be that
sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than sancho the governor
they make as good bread here as in france and by night all cats are
grey and a hard case enough his who hasnt broken his fast at two in
the afternoon and theres no stomach a hands breadth bigger than
another and the same can be filled with straw or hay as the saying
is and the little birds of the field have god for their purveyor and
caterer and four yards of cuenca frieze keep one warmer than four of
segovia broad cloth and when we quit this world and are put
underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the journeyman
and the popes body does not take up more feet of earth than the
sacristans for all that the one is higher than the other for when we
go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make ourselves small or
rather they pack us up and make us small in spite of us and then good
night to us and i say once more if your ladyship does not like to give
me the island because im a fool like a wise man i will take care to
give myself no trouble about it i have heard say that behind the cross
theres the devil and that all that glitters is not gold and that
from among the oxen and the ploughs and the yokes wamba the husbandman
was taken to be made king of spain and from among brocades and
pleasures and riches roderick was taken to be devoured by adders if
the verses of the old ballads dont lie
to be sure they dont lie exclaimed dona rodriguez the duenna who
was one of the listeners why theres a ballad that says they put king
rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads and adders and lizards and
that two days afterwards the king in a plaintive feeble voice cried
they gnaw me now they gnaw me now
and according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would
rather be a labouring man than a king if vermin are to eat him
the duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna or
wondering at the language and proverbs of sancho to whom she said
worthy sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise
he strives to keep it though it should cost him his life my lord and
husband the duke though not one of the errant sort is none the less a
knight for that reason and will keep his word about the promised island
in spite of the envy and malice of the world let sancho he of good
cheer for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on the
throne of his island and seat of dignity and will take possession of his
government that he may discard it for another of three bordered brocade
the charge i give him is to be careful how he governs his vassals
bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well born
as to governing them well said sancho theres no need of charging me
to do that for im kind hearted by nature and full of compassion for
the poor theres no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and bakes
and by my faith it wont do to throw false dice with me i am an old dog
and i know all about tus tus i can be wide awake if need be and i
dont let clouds come before my eyes for i know where the shoe pinches
me i say so because with me the good will have support and protection
and the bad neither footing nor access and it seems to me that in
governments to make a beginning is everything and maybe after having
been governor a fortnight ill take kindly to the work and know more
about it than the field labour i have been brought up to
you are right sancho said the duchess for no one is born ready
taught and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones but to
return to the subject we were discussing just now the enchantment of the
lady dulcinea i look upon it as certain and something more than
evident that sanchos idea of practising a deception upon his master
making him believe that the peasant girl was dulcinea and that if he did
not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted was all a device
of one of the enchanters that persecute don quixote for in truth and
earnest i know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is dulcinea del toboso and that worthy
sancho though he fancies himself the deceiver is the one that is
deceived and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this
than of anything else we never saw senor sancho panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us and tell us what
goes on in the world plainly and distinctly without subterfuge or
deception and believe me sancho that agile country lass was and is
dulcinea del toboso who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore
her and when we least expect it we shall see her in her own proper
form and then sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at
all thats very possible said sancho panza and now im willing to
believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of montesinos
where he says he saw the lady dulcinea del toboso in the very same dress
and apparel that i said i had seen her in when i enchanted her all to
please myself it must be all exactly the other way as your ladyship
says because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a
cunning trick could be concocted in a moment nor do i think my master is
so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe
a thing so out of all reason but senora your excellence must not
therefore think me ill disposed for a dolt like me is not bound to see
into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters i invented all that
to escape my masters scolding and not with any intention of hurting
him and if it has turned out differently there is a god in heaven who
that is true said the duchess but tell me sancho what is this you
say about the cave of montesinos for i should like to know
sancho upon this related to her word for word what has been said
already touching that adventure and having heard it the duchess said
from this occurrence it may be inferred that as the great don quixote
says he saw there the same country wench sancho saw on the way from el
toboso it is no doubt dulcinea and that there are some very active
so i say said sancho and if my lady dulcinea is enchanted so much
the worse for her and im not going to pick a quarrel with my masters
enemies who seem to be many and spiteful the truth is that the one i
saw was a country wench and i set her down to be a country wench and if
that was dulcinea it must not be laid at my door nor should i be called
to answer for it or take the consequences but they must go nagging at me
at every step sancho said it sancho did it sancho here sancho
there as if sancho was nobody at all and not that same sancho panza
thats now going all over the world in books so samson carrasco told me
and hes at any rate one thats a bachelor of salamanca and people of
that sort cant lie except when the whim seizes them or they have some
very good reason for it so theres no occasion for anybody to quarrel
with me and then i have a good character and as i have heard my master
say a good name is better than great riches let them only stick me
into this government and theyll see wonders for one who has been a good
all worthy sanchos observations said the duchess are catonian
sentences or at any rate out of the very heart of michael verino
himself who florentibus occidit annis in fact to speak in his own
style under a bad cloak theres often a good drinker
indeed senora said sancho i never yet drank out of wickedness from
thirst i have very likely for i have nothing of the hypocrite in me i
drink when im inclined or if im not inclined when they offer it to
me so as not to look either strait laced or ill bred for when a friend
drinks ones health what heart can be so hard as not to return it but if
i put on my shoes i dont dirty them besides squires to knights errant
mostly drink water for they are always wandering among woods forests
and meadows mountains and crags without a drop of wine to be had if
so i believe said the duchess and now let sancho go and take his
sleep and we will talk by and by at greater length and settle how he
may soon go and stick himself into the government as he says
sancho once more kissed the duchesss hand and entreated her to let good
care be taken of his dapple for he was the light of his eyes
my ass said sancho which not to mention him by that name im
accustomed to call dapple i begged this lady duenna here to take care of
him when i came into the castle and she got as angry as if i had said
she was ugly or old though it ought to be more natural and proper for
duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers god bless me what a
spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies
he must have been some clown said dona rodriguez the duenna for if
he had been a gentleman and well born he would have exalted them higher
that will do said the duchess no more of this hush dona rodriguez
and let senor panza rest easy and leave the treatment of dapple in my
charge for as he is a treasure of sanchos ill put him on the apple of
it will be enough for him to be in the stable said sancho for
neither he nor i are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your
highnesss eye and id as soon stab myself as consent to it for though
my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many
than a card too few when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind
what we are about and keep within due bounds
take him to your government sancho said the duchess and there you
will be able to make as much of him as you like and even release him
dont think senora duchess that you have said anything absurd said
sancho i have seen more than two asses go to governments and for me to
take mine with me would be nothing new
sanchos words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement
and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the
conversation she had had with him and between them they plotted and
arranged to play a joke upon don quixote that was to be a rare one and
entirely in knight errantry style and in that same style they practised
several upon him so much in keeping and so clever that they form the
which relates how they learned the way in which they were to disenchant
the peerless dulcinea del toboso which is one of the rarest adventures
great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of
don quixote and sancho panza and more bent than ever upon the plan they
had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and
appearance of adventures they took as their basis of action what don
quixote had already told them about the cave of montesinos in order to
play him a famous one but what the duchess marvelled at above all was
that sanchos simplicity could be so great as to make him believe as
absolute truth that dulcinea had been enchanted when it was he himself
who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business having
therefore instructed their servants in everything they were to do six
days afterwards they took him out to hunt with as great a retinue of
they presented don quixote with a hunting suit and sancho with another
of the finest green cloth but don quixote declined to put his on saying
that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms and could not carry
wardrobes or stores with him sancho however took what they gave him
the appointed day having arrived don quixote armed himself and sancho
arrayed himself and mounted on his dapple for he would not give him up
though they offered him a horse he placed himself in the midst of the
troop of huntsmen the duchess came out splendidly attired and don
quixote in pure courtesy and politeness held the rein of her palfrey
though the duke wanted not to allow him and at last they reached a wood
that lay between two high mountains where after occupying various
posts ambushes and paths and distributing the party in different
positions the hunt began with great noise shouting and hallooing so
that between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns they
could not hear one another the duchess dismounted and with a sharp
boar spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were
in the habit of passing the duke and don quixote likewise dismounted and
placed themselves one at each side of her sancho took up a position in
the rear of all without dismounting from dapple whom he dared not desert
lest some mischief should befall him scarcely had they taken their stand
in a line with several of their servants when they saw a huge boar
closely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen making
towards them grinding his teeth and tusks and scattering foam from his
mouth as soon as he saw him don quixote bracing his shield on his arm
and drawing his sword advanced to meet him the duke with boar spear did
the same but the duchess would have gone in front of them all had not
the duke prevented her sancho alone deserting dapple at the sight of
the mighty beast took to his heels as hard as he could and strove in
vain to mount a tall oak as he was clinging to a branch however
half way up in his struggle to reach the top the bough such was his
ill luck and hard fate gave way and caught in his fall by a broken limb
of the oak he hung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground
finding himself in this position and that the green coat was beginning
to tear and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might
be able to get at him he began to utter such cries and call for help so
earnestly that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must
be in the teeth of some wild beast in the end the tusked boar fell
pierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him and
don quixote turning round at the cries of sancho for he knew by them
that it was he saw him hanging from the oak head downwards with dapple
who did not forsake him in his distress close beside him and cide
hamete observes that he seldom saw sancho panza without seeing dapple or
dapple without seeing sancho panza such was their attachment and loyalty
one to the other don quixote went over and unhooked sancho who as soon
as he found himself on the ground looked at the rent in his huntingcoat
and was grieved to the heart for he thought he had got a patrimonial
meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule and
having covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle they
bore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field tents which had
been pitched in the middle of the wood where they found the tables laid
and dinner served in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy to
see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it sancho as he
showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess observed if we had
been hunting hares or after small birds my coat would have been safe
from being in the plight its in i dont know what pleasure one can find
in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his tusk if
he gets at you i recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says
that said don quixote was a gothic king who going a hunting was
just so said sancho and i would not have kings and princes expose
themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which to my mind
ought not to be one as it consists in killing an animal that has done no
quite the contrary sancho you are wrong there said the duke for
hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for
anybody else the chase is the emblem of war it has stratagems wiles
and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety in it extreme cold
and intolerable heat have to be borne indolence and sleep are despised
the bodily powers are invigorated the limbs of him who engages in it are
made supple and in a word it is a pursuit which may be followed
without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many and the best of it
is it is not for everybody as field sports of other sorts are except
hawking which also is only for kings and great lords reconsider your
opinion therefore sancho and when you are governor take to hunting and
nay said sancho the good governor should have a broken leg and keep
at home it would be a nice thing if after people had been at the
trouble of coming to look for him on business the governor were to be
away in the forest enjoying himself the government would go on badly in
that fashion by my faith senor hunting and amusements are more fit for
idlers than for governors what i intend to amuse myself with is playing
all fours at eastertime and bowls on sundays and holidays for these
huntings dont suit my condition or agree with my conscience
god grant it may turn out so said the duke because its a long step
be that as it may said sancho pledges dont distress a good payer
and he whom god helps does better than he who gets up early and its
the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes i mean to
say that if god gives me help and i do my duty honestly no doubt ill
govern better than a gerfalcon nay let them only put a finger in my
mouth and theyll see whether i can bite or not
the curse of god and all his saints upon thee thou accursed sancho
exclaimed don quixote when will the day come as i have often said to
thee when i shall hear thee make one single coherent rational remark
without proverbs pray your highnesses leave this fool alone for he
will grind your souls between not to say two but two thousand proverbs
dragged in as much in season and as much to the purpose as may god
grant as much health to him or to me if i want to listen to them
sancho panzas proverbs said the duchess though more in number than
the greek commanders are not therefore less to be esteemed for the
conciseness of the maxims for my own part i can say they give me more
pleasure than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably
in pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into
the wood and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and
hiding places and then night closed in not however as brilliantly or
tranquilly as might have been expected at the season for it was then
midsummer but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided the
project of the duke and duchess and thus as night began to fall and a
little after twilight set in suddenly the whole wood on all four sides
seemed to be on fire and shortly after here there on all sides a
vast number of trumpets and other military instruments were heard as if
several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood the blaze of the
fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and
deafened the ears of those that stood by and indeed of all who were in
the wood then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of
the moors when they rush to battle trumpets and clarions brayed drums
beat fifes played so unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had
any senses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many
instruments the duke was astounded the duchess amazed don quixote
wondering sancho panza trembling and indeed even they who were aware
of the cause were frightened in their fear silence fell upon them and
a postillion in the guise of a demon passed in front of them blowing
in lieu of a bugle a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse
ho there brother courier cried the duke who are you where are you
going what troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood
to which the courier replied in a harsh discordant voice i am the
devil i am in search of don quixote of la mancha those who are coming
this way are six troops of enchanters who are bringing on a triumphal
car the peerless dulcinea del toboso she comes under enchantment
together with the gallant frenchman montesinos to give instructions to
don quixote as to how she the said lady may be disenchanted
if you were the devil as you say and as your appearance indicates
said the duke you would have known the said knight don quixote of la
mancha for you have him here before you
by god and upon my conscience said the devil i never observed it
for my mind is occupied with so many different things that i was
this demon must be an honest fellow and a good christian said sancho
for if he wasnt he wouldnt swear by god and his conscience i feel
sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself
without dismounting the demon then turned to don quixote and said the
unfortunate but valiant knight montesinos sends me to thee the knight of
the lions would that i saw thee in their claws bidding me tell thee to
wait for him wherever i may find thee as he brings with him her whom
they call dulcinea del toboso that he may show thee what is needful in
order to disenchant her and as i came for no more i need stay no longer
demons of my sort be with thee and good angels with these gentles and
so saying he blew his huge horn turned about and went off without
they all felt fresh wonder but particularly sancho and don quixote
sancho to see how in defiance of the truth they would have it that
dulcinea was enchanted don quixote because he could not feel sure
whether what had happened to him in the cave of montesinos was true or
not and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him do
why not replied he here will i wait fearless and firm though all
well then if i see another devil or hear another horn like the last
ill wait here as much as in flanders said sancho
night now closed in more completely and many lights began to flit
through the wood just as those fiery exhalations from the earth that
look like shooting stars to our eyes flit through the heavens a
frightful noise too was heard like that made by the solid wheels the
ox carts usually have by the harsh ceaseless creaking of which they
say the bears and wolves are put to flight if there happen to be any
where they are passing in addition to all this commotion there came a
further disturbance to increase the tumult for now it seemed as if in
truth on all four sides of the wood four encounters or battles were
going on at the same time in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a
terrible cannonade in another numberless muskets were being discharged
the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand and farther
away the moorish lelilies were raised again and again in a word the
bugles the horns the clarions the trumpets the drums the cannon the
musketry and above all the tremendous noise of the carts all made up
together a din so confused and terrific that don quixote had need to
summon up all his courage to brave it but sanchos gave way and he fell
fainting on the skirt of the duchesss robe who let him lie there and
promptly bade them throw water in his face this was done and he came to
himself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels
reached the spot it was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with
black housings on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper
and on the top of the cart was constructed a raised seat on which sat a
venerable old man with a beard whiter than the very snow and so long
that it fell below his waist he was dressed in a long robe of black
buckram for as the cart was thickly set with a multitude of candles it
was easy to make out everything that was on it leading it were two
hideous demons also clad in buckram with countenances so frightful that
sancho having once seen them shut his eyes so as not to see them again
as soon as the cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his
lofty seat and standing up said in a loud voice i am the sage
lirgandeo and without another word the cart then passed on behind it
came another of the same form with another aged man enthroned who
stopping the cart said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first
i am the sage alquife the great friend of urganda the unknown and
passed on then another cart came by at the same pace but the occupant
of the throne was not old like the others but a man stalwart and robust
and of a forbidding countenance who as he came up said in a voice far
hoarser and more devilish i am the enchanter archelaus the mortal
enemy of amadis of gaul and all his kindred and then passed on having
gone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of
their wheels ceased and soon after they heard another not noise but
sound of sweet harmonious music of which sancho was very glad taking
it to be a good sign and said he to the duchess from whom he did not
stir a step or for a single instant senora where theres music there
nor where there are lights and it is bright said the duchess to which
sancho replied fire gives light and its bright where there are
bonfires as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may burn
us but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking
that remains to be seen said don quixote who was listening to all
that passed and he was right as is shown in the following chapter
wherein is continued the instruction given to don quixote touching the
disenchantment of dulcinea together with other marvellous incidents
they saw advancing towards them to the sound of this pleasing music
what they call a triumphal car drawn by six grey mules with white linen
housings on each of which was mounted a penitent robed also in white
with a large lighted wax taper in his hand the car was twice or
perhaps three times as large as the former ones and in front and on the
sides stood twelve more penitents all as white as snow and all with
lighted tapers a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder and on a
raised throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver tissue
veils with an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over
them that made her appear if not richly at least brilliantly
apparelled she had her face covered with thin transparent sendal the
texture of which did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being
distinguished while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her
beauty and of her years which seemed to be not less than seventeen but
not to have yet reached twenty beside her was a figure in a robe of
state as they call it reaching to the feet while the head was covered
with a black veil but the instant the car was opposite the duke and
duchess and don quixote the music of the clarions ceased and then that
of the lutes and harps on the car and the figure in the robe rose up
and flinging it apart and removing the veil from its face disclosed to
their eyes the shape of death itself fleshless and hideous at which
sight don quixote felt uneasy sancho frightened and the duke and
duchess displayed a certain trepidation having risen to its feet this
living death in a sleepy voice and with a tongue hardly awake held
i am that merlin who the legends say
the devil had for father and the lie
hath gathered credence with the lapse of time
i view the efforts of the age to hide
who are and ever have been dear to me
are mostly hard of heart not so am i
and its delight is doing good to all
in the dim caverns of the gloomy dis
my soul abideth now there came to me
the sorrow laden plaint of her the fair
i knew of her enchantment and her fate
from high born dame to peasant wench transformed
and touched with pity first i turned the leaves
to give relief in such a piteous case
o thou the pride and pink of all that wear
o beacon polestar path and guide of all
to thee great hero who all praise transcends
don quixote wise as brave to thee i say
t is needful that thy esquire sancho shall
on his own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven
and that they smart and sting and hurt him well
thus have the authors of her woe resolved
and this is gentles wherefore i have come
by all thats good exclaimed sancho at this ill just as soon give
myself three stabs with a dagger as three not to say three thousand
lashes the devil take such a way of disenchanting i dont see what my
backside has got to do with enchantments by god if senor merlin has not
found out some other way of disenchanting the lady dulcinea del toboso
but ill take you don clown stuffed with garlic said don quixote
and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth
and give you not to say three thousand three hundred but six thousand
six hundred lashes and so well laid on that they wont be got rid of if
you try three thousand three hundred times dont answer me a word or
on hearing this merlin said that will not do for the lashes worthy
sancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not by
force and at whatever time he pleases for there is no fixed limit
assigned to him but it is permitted him if he likes to commute by half
the pain of this whipping to let them be given by the hand of another
not a hand my own or anybody elses weighty or weighable shall touch
me said sancho was it i that gave birth to the lady dulcinea del
toboso that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes my master
indeed thats a part of her for hes always calling her my life and
my soul and his stay and prop may and ought to whip himself for her
and take all the trouble required for her disenchantment but for me to
as soon as sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at the
side of merlins ghost stood up and removing the thin veil from her face
disclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedingly
beautiful and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a voice
not very like a ladys addressing sancho directly said thou wretched
squire soul of a pitcher heart of a cork tree with bowels of flint and
pebbles if thou impudent thief they bade thee throw thyself down from
some lofty tower if enemy of mankind they asked thee to swallow a
dozen of toads two of lizards and three of adders if they wanted thee
to slay thy wife and children with a sharp murderous scimitar it would
be no wonder for thee to show thyself stubborn and squeamish but to make
a piece of work about three thousand three hundred lashes what every
poor little charity boy gets every month it is enough to amaze
astonish astound the compassionate bowels of all who hear it nay all
who come to hear it in the course of time turn o miserable
hard hearted animal turn i say those timorous owls eyes upon these of
mine that are compared to radiant stars and thou wilt see them weeping
trickling streams and rills and tracing furrows tracks and paths over
the fair fields of my cheeks let it move thee crafty ill conditioned
monster to see my blooming youth still in its teens for i am not yet
twenty wasting and withering away beneath the husk of a rude peasant
wench and if i do not appear in that shape now it is a special favour
senor merlin here has granted me to the sole end that my beauty may
soften thee for the tears of beauty in distress turn rocks into cotton
and tigers into ewes lay on to that hide of thine thou great untamed
brute rouse up thy lusty vigour that only urges thee to eat and eat and
set free the softness of my flesh the gentleness of my nature and the
fairness of my face and if thou wilt not relent or come to reason for
me do so for the sake of that poor knight thou hast beside thee thy
master i mean whose soul i can this moment see how he has it stuck in
his throat not ten fingers from his lips and only waiting for thy
inflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go back
don quixote on hearing this felt his throat and turning to the duke he
said by god senor dulcinea says true i have my soul stuck here in my
what say you to this sancho said the duchess
i say senora returned sancho what i said before as for the lashes
abrenuncio you should say sancho and not as you do said the duke
let me alone your highness said sancho im not in a humour now to
look into niceties or a letter more or less for these lashes that are to
be given me or im to give myself have so upset me that i dont know
what im saying or doing but id like to know of this lady my lady
dulcinea del toboso where she learned this way she has of asking
favours she comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes and she calls
me soul of a pitcher and great untamed brute and a string of foul names
that the devil is welcome to is my flesh brass or is it anything to me
whether she is enchanted or not does she bring with her a basket of fair
linen shirts kerchiefs socks not that wear any to coax me no
nothing but one piece of abuse after another though she knows the
proverb they have here that an ass loaded with gold goes lightly up a
mountain and that gifts break rocks and praying to god and plying
the hammer and that one take is better than two ill give thees
then theres my master who ought to stroke me down and pet me to make me
turn wool and carded cotton he says if he gets hold of me hell tie me
naked to a tree and double the tale of lashes on me these tender hearted
gentry should consider that its not merely a squire but a governor they
are asking to whip himself just as if it was drink with cherries let
them learn plague take them the right way to ask and beg and behave
themselves for all times are not alike nor are people always in good
humour im now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn
and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will i having as
little fancy for it as for turning cacique
well then the fact is friend sancho said the duke that unless you
become softer than a ripe fig you shall not get hold of the government
it would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders a cruel governor
with flinty bowels who wont yield to the tears of afflicted damsels or
to the prayers of wise magisterial ancient enchanters and sages in
short sancho either you must be whipped by yourself or they must whip
senor said sancho wont two days grace be given me in which to
no certainly not said merlin here this minute and on the spot
the matter must be settled either dulcinea will return to the cave of
montesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench or else in her
present form shall be carried to the elysian fields where she will
remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed
now then sancho said the duchess show courage and gratitude for
your master don quixotes bread that you have eaten we are all bound to
oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry
consent to this whipping my son to the devil with the devil and leave
fear to milksops for a stout heart breaks bad luck as you very well
to this sancho replied with an irrelevant remark which addressing
merlin he made to him will your worship tell me senor merlin when
that courier devil came up he gave my master a message from senor
montesinos charging him to wait for him here as he was coming to
arrange how the lady dona dulcinea del toboso was to be disenchanted but
up to the present we have not seen montesinos nor anything like him
to which merlin made answer the devil sancho is a blockhead and a
great scoundrel i sent him to look for your master but not with a
message from montesinos but from myself for montesinos is in his cave
expecting or more properly speaking waiting for his disenchantment for
theres the tail to be skinned yet for him if he owes you anything or
you have any business to transact with him ill bring him to you and put
him where you choose but for the present make up your mind to consent to
this penance and believe me it will be very good for you for soul as
well for body for your soul because of the charity with which you
perform it for your body because i know that you are of a sanguine habit
and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood
there are a great many doctors in the world even the enchanters are
doctors said sancho however as everybody tells me the same
thing though i cant see it myself i say i am willing to give myself
the three thousand three hundred lashes provided i am to lay them on
whenever i like without any fixing of days or times and ill try and
get out of debt as quickly as i can that the world may enjoy the beauty
of the lady dulcinea del toboso as it seems contrary to what i thought
that she is beautiful after all it must be a condition too that i am
not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge and that if any of the
lashes happen to be fly flappers they are to count item that in case i
should make any mistake in the reckoning senor merlin as he knows
everything is to keep count and let me know how many are still wanting
there will be no need to let you know of any over said merlin
because when you reach the full number the lady dulcinea will at once
and that very instant be disenchanted and will come in her gratitude to
seek out the worthy sancho and thank him and even reward him for the
good work so you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too many or
too few heaven forbid i should cheat anyone of even a hair of his head
well then in gods hands be it said sancho in the hard case im in
i give in i say i accept the penance on the conditions laid down
the instant sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions
struck up once more and again a host of muskets were discharged and don
quixote hung on sanchos neck kissing him again and again on the forehead
and cheeks the duchess and the duke expressed the greatest satisfaction
the car began to move on and as it passed the fair dulcinea bowed to the
duke and duchess and made a low curtsey to sancho
and now bright smiling dawn came on apace the flowers of the field
revived raised up their heads and the crystal waters of the brooks
murmuring over the grey and white pebbles hastened to pay their tribute
to the expectant rivers the glad earth the unclouded sky the fresh
breeze the clear light each and all showed that the day that came
treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright the duke and
duchess pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so
cleverly and successfully returned to their castle resolved to follow up
their joke for to them there was no reality that could afford them more
wherein is related the strange and undreamt of adventure of the
distressed duenna alias the countess trifaldi together with a letter
which sancho panza wrote to his wife teresa panza
the duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn and he it
was that played the part of merlin made all the arrangements for the
late adventure composed the verses and got a page to represent
dulcinea and now with the assistance of his master and mistress he got
up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be
the duchess asked sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with his
penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of dulcinea
he said he had and had given himself five lashes overnight
the duchess asked him what he had given them with
that said the duchess is more like giving oneself slaps than lashes
i am sure the sage merlin will not be satisfied with such tenderness
worthy sancho must make a scourge with claws or a cat o nine tails
that will make itself felt for its with blood that letters enter and
the release of so great a lady as dulcinea will not be granted so
cheaply or at such a paltry price and remember sancho that works of
charity done in a lukewarm and half hearted way are without merit and of
to which sancho replied if your ladyship will give me a proper scourge
or cord ill lay on with it provided it does not hurt too much for you
must know boor as i am my flesh is more cotton than hemp and it wont
do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else
so be it by all means said the duchess tomorrow ill give you a
scourge that will be just the thing for you and will accommodate itself
to the tenderness of your flesh as if it was its own sister
then said sancho your highness must know dear lady of my soul that i
have a letter written to my wife teresa panza giving her an account of
all that has happened me since i left her i have it here in my bosom
and theres nothing wanting but to put the address to it id be glad if
your discretion would read it for i think it runs in the governor style
i mean the way governors ought to write
who should have dictated but myself sinner as i am said sancho
and did you write it yourself said the duchess
that i didnt said sancho for i can neither read nor write though i
let us see it said the duchess for never fear but you display in it
sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom and the duchess taking
sancho panzas letter to his wife teresa panza
if i was well whipped i went mounted like a gentleman if i have got a
good government it is at the cost of a good whipping thou wilt not
understand this just now my teresa by and by thou wilt know what it
means i may tell thee teresa i mean thee to go in a coach for that is
a matter of importance because every other way of going is going on
all fours thou art a governors wife take care that nobody speaks evil
of thee behind thy back i send thee here a green hunting suit that my
lady the duchess gave me alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice
for our daughter don quixote my master if i am to believe what i hear
in these parts is a madman of some sense and a droll blockhead and i
am no way behind him we have been in the cave of montesinos and the
sage merlin has laid hold of me for the disenchantment of dulcinea del
toboso her that is called aldonza lorenzo over there with three
thousand three hundred lashes less five that im to give myself she
will be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that bore her say
nothing of this to anyone for make thy affairs public and some will
say they are white and others will say they are black i shall leave this
in a few days for my government to which i am going with a mighty great
desire to make money for they tell me all new governors set out with the
