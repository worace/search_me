burning houses and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was
extinguished it was mid day before bulows vanguard had been able to
had the action been begun two hours earlier it would have been over
at four oclock and blucher would have fallen on the battle won by
napoleon such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which
the emperor had been the first as early as mid day to descry with his
field glass on the extreme horizon something which had attracted his
attention he had said i see yonder a cloud which seems to me to be
troops then he asked the duc de dalmatie soult what do you see in
the direction of chapelle saint lambert the marshal levelling his
glass answered four or five thousand men sire evidently grouchy
but it remained motionless in the mist all the glasses of the staff
had studied the cloud pointed out by the emperor some said it is
trees the truth is that the cloud did not move the emperor detached
domons division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter
bulow had not moved in fact his vanguard was very feeble and could
accomplish nothing he was obliged to wait for the body of the army
corps and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before
entering into line but at five oclock perceiving wellingtons peril
blucher ordered bulow to attack and uttered these remarkable words we
a little later the divisions of losthin hiller hacke and ryssel
deployed before lobaus corps the cavalry of prince william of prussia
debouched from the forest of paris plancenoit was in flames and the
prussian cannon balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in
every one knows the rest the irruption of a third army the battle
broken to pieces eighty six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously
pirch the first coming up with bulow zietens cavalry led by blucher
in person the french driven back marcognet swept from the plateau of
ohain durutte dislodged from papelotte donzelot and quiot retreating
lobau caught on the flank a fresh battle precipitating itself on our
dismantled regiments at nightfall the whole english line resuming the
offensive and thrust forward the gigantic breach made in the french
army the english grape shot and the prussian grape shot aiding each
other the extermination disaster in front disaster on the flank the
guard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all
conscious that they were about to die they shouted vive lempereur
history records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in
the sky had been overcast all day long all of a sudden at that very
moment it was eight oclock in the evening the clouds on the horizon
parted and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to
pass through athwart the elms on the nivelles road they had seen it
each battalion of the guard was commanded by a general for this final
catastrophe friant michel roguet harlet mallet poret de morvan
were there when the tall caps of the grenadiers of the guard with
their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared symmetrical in line
tranquil in the midst of that combat the enemy felt a respect for
france they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field
of battle with wings outspread and those who were the conquerors
believing themselves to be vanquished retreated but wellington
shouted up guards and aim straight the red regiment of english
guards lying flat behind the hedges sprang up a cloud of grape shot
riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles all hurled
themselves forwards and the final carnage began in the darkness the
imperial guard felt the army losing ground around it and in the vast
shock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the
place of the vive lempereur and with flight behind it it continued
to advance more crushed losing more men at every step that it took
there were none who hesitated no timid men in its ranks the soldier in
that troop was as much of a hero as the general not a man was missing
ney bewildered great with all the grandeur of accepted death offered
himself to all blows in that tempest he had his fifth horse killed
under him there perspiring his eyes aflame foaming at the mouth with
uniform unbuttoned one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword stroke
from a horseguard his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet
bleeding bemired magnificent a broken sword in his hand he said
come and see how a marshal of france dies on the field of battle but
in vain he did not die he was haggard and angry at drouet derlon he
hurled this question are you not going to get yourself killed in
the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men
he shouted so there is nothing for me oh i should like to have all
these english bullets enter my bowels unhappy man thou wert reserved
the army yielded suddenly on all sides at once hougomont la
haie sainte papelotte plancenoit the cry treachery was followed by
a cry of save yourselves who can an army which is disbanding is
like a thaw all yields splits cracks floats rolls falls jostles
hastens is precipitated the disintegration is unprecedented ney

places himself across the brussels road stopping both english and
french he strives to detain the army he recalls it to its duty he
insults it he clings to the rout he is overwhelmed the soldiers fly
from him shouting long live marshal ney two of duruttes regiments
go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the
swords of the uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of kempt best
pack and rylandt the worst of hand to hand conflicts is the defeat
friends kill each other in order to escape squadrons and battalions
break and disperse against each other like the tremendous foam of
battle lobau at one extremity and reille at the other are drawn into
the tide in vain does napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of
his guard in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable
squadrons quiot retreats before vivian kellermann before vandeleur

past the line of fugitives harangues urges threatens entreats
them all the mouths which in the morning had shouted long live
the emperor remain gaping they hardly recognize him the prussian
cavalry newly arrived dashes forwards flies hews slashes kills
exterminates horses lash out the cannons flee the soldiers of the
artillery train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their
escape transports overturned with all four wheels in the air clog the
road and occasion massacres men are crushed trampled down others walk
over the dead and the living arms are lost a dizzy multitude fills the
roads the paths the bridges the plains the hills the valleys
the woods encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men shouts
despair knapsacks and guns flung among the rye passages forced at
the point of the sword no more comrades no more officers no more
generals an inexpressible terror zieten putting france to the sword at
its leisure lions converted into goats such was the flight
at genappe an effort was made to wheel about to present a battle
front to draw up in line lobau rallied three hundred men the entrance
to the village was barricaded but at the first volley of prussian
canister all took to flight again and lobau was taken that volley of
grape shot can be seen to day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick
building on the right of the road at a few minutes distance before you
enter genappe the prussians threw themselves into genappe furious no
doubt that they were not more entirely the conquerors the pursuit was
stupendous blucher ordered extermination roguet had set the lugubrious
example of threatening with death any french grenadier who should bring
him a prussian prisoner blucher outdid roguet duhesme the general
of the young guard hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at genappe
surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death who took the sword and slew
the prisoner the victory was completed by the assassination of the
vanquished let us inflict punishment since we are history old
blucher disgraced himself this ferocity put the finishing touch to the
disaster the desperate route traversed genappe traversed quatre bras
thuin and only halted at the frontier alas and who then was fleeing
this vertigo this terror this downfall into ruin of the loftiest
bravery which ever astounded history is that causeless no the shadow
of an enormous right is projected athwart waterloo it is the day of
destiny the force which is mightier than man produced that day hence
the terrified wrinkle of those brows hence all those great souls
surrendering their swords those who had conquered europe have fallen
prone on the earth with nothing left to say nor to do feeling the
present shadow of a terrible presence hoc erat in fatis that day the
perspective of the human race underwent a change waterloo is the
hinge of the nineteenth century the disappearance of the great man was
necessary to the advent of the great century some one a person to whom
one replies not took the responsibility on himself the panic of heroes
can be explained in the battle of waterloo there is something more than
a cloud there is something of the meteor god has passed by
at nightfall in a meadow near genappe bernard and bertrand seized by
the skirt of his coat and detained a man haggard pensive sinister
gloomy who dragged to that point by the current of the rout had just
dismounted had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm and with
wild eye was returning alone to waterloo it was napoleon the immense
somnambulist of this dream which had crumbled essaying once more to
several squares of the guard motionless amid this stream of the defeat
as rocks in running water held their own until night night came
death also they awaited that double shadow and invincible allowed
themselves to be enveloped therein each regiment isolated from the
rest and having no bond with the army now shattered in every part
died alone they had taken up position for this final action some on
the heights of rossomme others on the plain of mont saint jean there
abandoned vanquished terrible those gloomy squares endured their
death throes in formidable fashion ulm wagram jena friedland died
at twilight towards nine oclock in the evening one of them was left
at the foot of the plateau of mont saint jean in that fatal valley
at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended now
inundated by the masses of the english under the converging fires
of the victorious hostile cavalry under a frightful density of
projectiles this square fought on it was commanded by an obscure
officer named cambronne at each discharge the square diminished and
replied it replied to the grape shot with a fusillade continually
contracting its four walls the fugitives pausing breathless for a
moment in the distance listened in the darkness to that gloomy and
when this legion had been reduced to a handful when nothing was left
of their flag but a rag when their guns the bullets all gone were no
longer anything but clubs when the heap of corpses was larger than the
group of survivors there reigned among the conquerors around those men
dying so sublimely a sort of sacred terror and the english artillery
taking breath became silent this furnished a sort of respite these
combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of
spectres silhouettes of men on horseback the black profiles of cannon
the white sky viewed through wheels and gun carriages the colossal
deaths head which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke in the
depths of the battle advanced upon them and gazed at them through the
shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded the matches
all lighted like the eyes of tigers at night formed a circle round
their heads all the lintstocks of the english batteries approached the
cannons and then with emotion holding the supreme moment suspended
above these men an english general colville according to some
maitland according to others shouted to them surrender brave
editors commentary another edition of this book has the word merde
if any french reader object to having his susceptibilities offended one
would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps
the finest reply that a frenchman ever made this would enjoin us from
at our own risk and peril let us violate this injunction
now then among those giants there was one titan cambronne
to make that reply and then perish what could be grander for being
willing to die is the same as to die and it was not this mans fault if
the winner of the battle of waterloo was not napoleon who was put to
flight nor wellington giving way at four oclock in despair at five
nor blucher who took no part in the engagement the winner of waterloo
to thunder forth such a reply at the lightning flash that kills you is
thus to answer the catastrophe thus to speak to fate to give this
pedestal to the future lion to hurl such a challenge to the midnight
rainstorm to the treacherous wall of hougomont to the sunken road of
ohain to grouchys delay to bluchers arrival to be irony itself in
the tomb to act so as to stand upright though fallen to drown in
two syllables the european coalition to offer kings privies which
the caesars once knew to make the lowest of words the most lofty by
entwining with it the glory of france insolently to end waterloo with
mardigras to finish leonidas with rabellais to set the crown on this
victory by a word impossible to speak to lose the field and preserve
history to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage this is
it was an insult such as a thunder cloud might hurl it reaches the
cambronnes reply produces the effect of a violent break tis like the
breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn tis the overflow of agony
bursting forth who conquered wellington no had it not been for
blucher he was lost was it blucher no if wellington had not begun
blucher could not have finished this cambronne this man spending his
last hour this unknown soldier this infinitesimal of war realizes
that here is a falsehood a falsehood in a catastrophe and so doubly
agonizing and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of
it he is offered this mockery life how could he restrain himself
yonder are all the kings of europe the generals flushed with victory
the jupiters darting thunderbolts they have a hundred thousand
victorious soldiers and back of the hundred thousand a million their
cannon stand with yawning mouths the match is lighted they grind down
under their heels the imperial guards and the grand army they have
just crushed napoleon and only cambronne remains only this earthworm
is left to protest he will protest then he seeks for the appropriate
word as one seeks for a sword his mouth froths and the froth is the
word in face of this mean and mighty victory in face of this victory
which counts none victorious this desperate soldier stands erect he
grants its overwhelming immensity but he establishes its triviality
and he does more than spit upon it borne down by numbers by superior
force by brute matter he finds in his soul an expression excrement
we repeat it to use that word to do thus to invent such an
the spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent
on that unknown man cambronne invents the word for waterloo as rouget
invents the marseillaise under the visitation of a breath from on
high an emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes
sweeping over these men and they shake and one of them sings the song
supreme and the other utters the frightful cry
this challenge of titanic scorn cambronne hurls not only at europe in
the name of the empire that would be a trifle he hurls it at the past
in the name of the revolution it is heard and cambronne is recognized
as possessed by the ancient spirit of the titans danton seems to be
at that word from cambronne the english voice responded fire
the batteries flamed the hill trembled from all those brazen mouths
belched a last terrible gush of grape shot a vast volume of smoke
vaguely white in the light of the rising moon rolled out and when the
smoke dispersed there was no longer anything there that formidable
remnant had been annihilated the guard was dead the four walls of the
living redoubt lay prone and hardly was there discernible here and
there even a quiver in the bodies it was thus that the french legions
greater than the roman legions expired on mont saint jean on the soil
watered with rain and blood amid the gloomy grain on the spot where
nowadays joseph who drives the post wagon from nivelles passes
whistling and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four oclock in the
the battle of waterloo is an enigma it is as obscure to those who won
it as to those who lost it for napoleon it was a panic10 blucher
sees nothing in it but fire wellington understands nothing in regard
to it look at the reports the bulletins are confused the commentaries
involved some stammer others lisp jomini divides the battle of
waterloo into four moments muffling cuts it up into three changes
charras alone though we hold another judgment than his on some points
seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that
catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance all the
other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled and in this dazzled
state they fumble about it was a day of lightning brilliancy in fact
a crumbling of the military monarchy which to the vast stupefaction of
kings drew all the kingdoms after it the fall of force the defeat of
in this event stamped with superhuman necessity the part played by men
if we take waterloo from wellington and blucher do we thereby deprive
england and germany of anything no neither that illustrious england
nor that august germany enter into the problem of waterloo thank
heaven nations are great independently of the lugubrious feats of
the sword neither england nor germany nor france is contained in
a scabbard at this epoch when waterloo is only a clashing of swords
above blucher germany has schiller above wellington england has
byron a vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century and in
that aurora england and germany have a magnificent radiance they
are majestic because they think the elevation of level which they
contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them it proceeds from
themselves and not from an accident the aggrandizement which they have
brought to the nineteenth century has not waterloo as its source it is
only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory that is
the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm civilized people
especially in our day are neither elevated nor abased by the good or
bad fortune of a captain their specific gravity in the human species
results from something more than a combat their honor thank god their
dignity their intelligence their genius are not numbers which those
gamblers heroes and conquerors can put in the lottery of battles
often a battle is lost and progress is conquered there is less glory
and more liberty the drum holds its peace reason takes the word it is
a game in which he who loses wins let us therefore speak of waterloo
coldly from both sides let us render to chance that which is due
to chance and to god that which is due to god what is waterloo a
victory no the winning number in the lottery
the quine 11 won by europe paid by france
it was not worth while to place a lion there
waterloo moreover is the strangest encounter in history napoleon and
wellington they are not enemies they are opposites never did god
who is fond of antitheses make a more striking contrast a more
extraordinary comparison on one side precision foresight geometry
prudence an assured retreat reserves spared with an obstinate
coolness an imperturbable method strategy which takes advantage
of the ground tactics which preserve the equilibrium of battalions
carnage executed according to rule war regulated watch in hand
nothing voluntarily left to chance the ancient classic courage
absolute regularity on the other intuition divination military
oddity superhuman instinct a flaming glance an indescribable
something which gazes like an eagle and which strikes like the
lightning a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity all the mysteries
of a profound soul associated with destiny the stream the plain the
forest the hill summoned and in a manner forced to obey the despot
going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle faith in
a star mingled with strategic science elevating but perturbing it
wellington was the bareme of war napoleon was its michael angelo and
on this occasion genius was vanquished by calculation on both sides
some one was awaited it was the exact calculator who succeeded
napoleon was waiting for grouchy he did not come wellington expected
wellington is classic war taking its revenge bonaparte at his dawning
had encountered him in italy and beaten him superbly the old owl had
fled before the young vulture the old tactics had been not only struck
as by lightning but disgraced who was that corsican of six and twenty
what signified that splendid ignoramus who with everything against
him nothing in his favor without provisions without ammunition
without cannon without shoes almost without an army with a mere
handful of men against masses hurled himself on europe combined
and absurdly won victories in the impossible whence had issued that
fulminating convict who almost without taking breath and with the same
set of combatants in hand pulverized one after the other the five
armies of the emperor of germany upsetting beaulieu on alvinzi wurmser
on beaulieu melas on wurmser mack on melas who was this novice in
war with the effrontery of a luminary the academical military school
excommunicated him and as it lost its footing hence the implacable
rancor of the old caesarism against the new of the regular sword
against the flaming sword and of the exchequer against genius on the
18th of june 1815 that rancor had the last word and beneath lodi
montebello montenotte mantua arcola it wrote waterloo a triumph of
the mediocres which is sweet to the majority destiny consented to this
irony in his decline napoleon found wurmser the younger again in
in fact to get wurmser it sufficed to blanch the hair of wellington
waterloo is a battle of the first order won by a captain of the second
that which must be admired in the battle of waterloo is england the
english firmness the english resolution the english blood the superb
thing about england there no offence to her was herself it was not
wellington oddly ungrateful declares in a letter to lord bathurst
that his army the army which fought on the 18th of june 1815 was a
detestable army what does that sombre intermingling of bones buried
beneath the furrows of waterloo think of that
england has been too modest in the matter of wellington to make
wellington so great is to belittle england wellington is nothing but
a hero like many another those scotch grays those horse guards those
regiments of maitland and of mitchell that infantry of pack and kempt
that cavalry of ponsonby and somerset those highlanders playing the
pibroch under the shower of grape shot those battalions of rylandt
those utterly raw recruits who hardly knew how to handle a musket
holding their own against esslings and rivolis old troops that is
what was grand wellington was tenacious in that lay his merit and we
are not seeking to lessen it but the least of his foot soldiers and of
his cavalry would have been as solid as he the iron soldier is worth
as much as the iron duke as for us all our glorification goes to the
english soldier to the english army to the english people if trophy
there be it is to england that the trophy is due the column of
waterloo would be more just if instead of the figure of a man it bore
but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here she
still cherishes after her own 1688 and our 1789 the feudal illusion
she believes in heredity and hierarchy this people surpassed by none
in power and glory regards itself as a nation and not as a people and
as a people it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its
head as a workman it allows itself to be disdained as a soldier it
it will be remembered that at the battle of inkermann a sergeant who
had it appears saved the army could not be mentioned by lord paglan
as the english military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the
grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports
that which we admire above all in an encounter of the nature of
waterloo is the marvellous cleverness of chance a nocturnal rain the
wall of hougomont the hollow road of ohain grouchy deaf to the cannon
napoleons guide deceiving him bulows guide enlightening him the
on the whole let us say it plainly it was more of a massacre than of a
of all pitched battles waterloo is the one which has the smallest front
for such a number of combatants napoleon three quarters of a league
wellington half a league seventy two thousand combatants on each side
the following calculation has been made and the following proportion
established loss of men at austerlitz french fourteen per cent
russians thirty per cent austrians forty four per cent at wagram
french thirteen per cent austrians fourteen at the moskowa french
thirty seven per cent russians forty four at bautzen french
thirteen per cent russians and prussians fourteen at waterloo
french fifty six per cent the allies thirty one total for waterloo
forty one per cent one hundred and forty four thousand combatants
to day the field of waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth
the impassive support of man and it resembles all plains
at night moreover a sort of visionary mist arises from it and if a
traveller strolls there if he listens if he watches if he dreams
like virgil in the fatal plains of philippi the hallucination of the
catastrophe takes possession of him the frightful 18th of june lives
again the false monumental hillock disappears the lion vanishes in
air the battle field resumes its reality lines of infantry undulate
over the plain furious gallops traverse the horizon the frightened
dreamer beholds the flash of sabres the gleam of bayonets the flare of
bombs the tremendous interchange of thunders he hears as it were
the death rattle in the depths of a tomb the vague clamor of the battle
phantom those shadows are grenadiers those lights are cuirassiers
that skeleton napoleon that other skeleton is wellington all this no
longer exists and yet it clashes together and combats still and the
ravines are empurpled and the trees quiver and there is fury even in
the clouds and in the shadows all those terrible heights hougomont
mont saint jean frischemont papelotte plancenoit appear confusedly
crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other
chapter xvii is waterloo to be considered good
there exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate
waterloo we do not belong to it to us waterloo is but the stupefied
date of liberty that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is
if one places ones self at the culminating point of view of the
question waterloo is intentionally a counter revolutionary victory it
is europe against france it is petersburg berlin and vienna against
paris it is the statu quo against the initiative it is the 14th
of july 1789 attacked through the 20th of march 1815 it is the
monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable french
rioting the final extinction of that vast people which had been in
eruption for twenty six years such was the dream the solidarity of the
brunswicks the nassaus the romanoffs the hohenzollerns the hapsburgs
with the bourbons waterloo bears divine right on its crupper it is
true that the empire having been despotic the kingdom by the natural
reaction of things was forced to be liberal and that a constitutional
order was the unwilling result of waterloo to the great regret of the
conquerors it is because revolution cannot be really conquered and
that being providential and absolutely fatal it is always cropping
up afresh before waterloo in bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones
after waterloo in louis xviii granting and conforming to the charter
bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of naples and a sergeant
on the throne of sweden employing inequality to demonstrate equality
louis xviii at saint ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights
of man if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is call it
progress and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress
call it to morrow to morrow fulfils its work irresistibly and it is
already fulfilling it to day it always reaches its goal strangely it
employs wellington to make of foy who was only a soldier an orator
foy falls at hougomont and rises again in the tribune thus does
progress proceed there is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman
it does not become disconcerted but adjusts to its divine work the
man who has bestridden the alps and the good old tottering invalid
of father elysee it makes use of the gouty man as well as of the
conqueror of the conqueror without of the gouty man within waterloo
by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword had
no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in
another direction the slashers have finished it was the turn of the
thinkers the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued
its march that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty
in short and incontestably that which triumphed at waterloo that
which smiled in wellingtons rear that which brought him all the
marshals staffs of europe including it is said the staff of a
marshal of france that which joyously trundled the barrows full of
bones to erect the knoll of the lion that which triumphantly inscribed
on that pedestal the date june 18 1815 that which encouraged
blucher as he put the flying army to the sword that which from the
heights of the plateau of mont saint jean hovered over france as over
its prey was the counter revolution it was the counter revolution
which murmured that infamous word dismemberment on arriving in paris
it beheld the crater close at hand it felt those ashes which scorched
its feet and it changed its mind it returned to the stammer of a
let us behold in waterloo only that which is in waterloo of intentional
liberty there is none the counter revolution was involuntarily liberal
in the same manner as by a corresponding phenomenon napoleon was
involuntarily revolutionary on the 18th of june 1815 the mounted
end of the dictatorship a whole european system crumbled away
the empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the roman world as
it expired again we behold the abyss as in the days of the barbarians
only the barbarism of 1815 which must be called by its pet name of the
counter revolution was not long breathed soon fell to panting and
halted short the empire was bewept let us acknowledge the fact and
bewept by heroic eyes if glory lies in the sword converted into a
sceptre the empire had been glory in person it had diffused over the
earth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light we will say
more an obscure light compared to the true daylight it is night this
disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse
louis xviii re entered paris the circling dances of the 8th of july
effaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of march the corsican became the
antithesis of the bearnese the flag on the dome of the tuileries was
white the exile reigned hartwells pine table took its place in front
of the fleur de lys strewn throne of louis xiv bouvines and fontenoy
were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding
day austerlitz having become antiquated the altar and the throne
fraternized majestically one of the most undisputed forms of the health
of society in the nineteenth century was established over france and
over the continent europe adopted the white cockade trestaillon was
celebrated the device non pluribus impar re appeared on the stone rays
representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the quai dorsay
where there had been an imperial guard there was now a red house the
arc du carrousel all laden with badly borne victories thrown out
of its element among these novelties a little ashamed it may be of
marengo and arcola extricated itself from its predicament with the
statue of the duc dangouleme the cemetery of the madeleine a terrible
paupers grave in 1793 was covered with jasper and marble since the
bones of louis xvi and marie antoinette lay in that dust
in the moat of vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth
recalling the fact that the duc denghien had perished in the very
month when napoleon was crowned pope pius vii who had performed the
coronation very near this death tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the
fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation at schoenbrunn there was
a little shadow aged four whom it was seditious to call the king of
rome and these things took place and the kings resumed their thrones
and the master of europe was put in a cage and the old regime became
the new regime and all the shadows and all the light of the earth
changed place because on the afternoon of a certain summers day a
shepherd said to a prussian in the forest go this way and not that
this 1815 was a sort of lugubrious april ancient unhealthy and
poisonous realities were covered with new appearances a lie wedded
1789 the right divine was masked under a charter fictions became
article 14 in the heart were varnished over with liberalism it was the
man had been rendered both greater and smaller by napoleon under this
reign of splendid matter the ideal had received the strange name of
ideology it is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future
into derision the populace however that food for cannon which is so
fond of the cannoneer sought him with its glance where is he what is
he doing napoleon is dead said a passer by to a veteran of marengo
and waterloo he dead cried the soldier you dont know him
imagination distrusted this man even when overthrown the depths of
europe were full of darkness after waterloo something enormous remained
the kings placed themselves in this void ancient europe profited by
it to undertake reforms there was a holy alliance belle alliance
beautiful alliance the fatal field of waterloo had said in advance
in presence and in face of that antique europe reconstructed the
features of a new france were sketched out the future which the
emperor had rallied made its entry on its brow it bore the star
liberty the glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it
singular fact people were at one and the same time in love with
the future liberty and the past napoleon defeat had rendered the
vanquished greater bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than napoleon
erect those who had triumphed were alarmed england had him guarded by
hudson lowe and france had him watched by montchenu his folded arms
became a source of uneasiness to thrones alexander called him my
sleeplessness this terror was the result of the quantity of
revolution which was contained in him that is what explains and excuses
bonapartist liberalism this phantom caused the old world to tremble
the kings reigned but ill at their ease with the rock of saint helena
while napoleon was passing through the death struggle at longwood the
sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of waterloo were quietly
rotting and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world
the congress of vienna made the treaties in 1815 and europe called this
but what matters it to the infinite all that tempest all that cloud
that war then that peace all that darkness did not trouble for a
moment the light of that immense eye before which a grub skipping from
one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to
let us return it is a necessity in this book to that fatal
on the 18th of june the moon was full its light favored bluchers
ferocious pursuit betrayed the traces of the fugitives delivered
up that disastrous mass to the eager prussian cavalry and aided the
massacre such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during
after the last cannon shot had been fired the plain of mont saint jean
the english occupied the encampment of the french it is the usual sign
of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished they established their
bivouac beyond rossomme the prussians let loose on the retreating
rout pushed forward wellington went to the village of waterloo to draw
if ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable it certainly is to that
village of waterloo waterloo took no part and lay half a league from
the scene of action mont saint jean was cannonaded hougomont was
burned la haie sainte was taken by assault papelotte was burned
plancenoit was burned la belle alliance beheld the embrace of the two
conquerors these names are hardly known and waterloo which worked not
in the battle bears off all the honor
we are not of the number of those who flatter war when the occasion
presents itself we tell the truth about it war has frightful beauties
which we have not concealed it has also we acknowledge some hideous
features one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the
bodies of the dead after the victory the dawn which follows a battle
who does this who thus soils the triumph what hideous furtive hand is
that which is slipped into the pocket of victory what pickpockets
are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory some
philosophers voltaire among the number affirm that it is precisely
those persons have made the glory it is the same men they say there
is no relief corps those who are erect pillage those who are prone
on the earth the hero of the day is the vampire of the night one has
assuredly the right after all to strip a corpse a bit when one is the
author of that corpse for our own part we do not think so it seems
to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the
one thing is certain which is that generally after conquerors follow
thieves but let us leave the soldier especially the contemporary
every army has a rear guard and it is that which must be blamed
bat like creatures half brigands and lackeys all the sorts of
vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders wearers of
uniforms who take no part in the fighting pretended invalids
formidable limpers interloping sutlers trotting along in little carts
sometimes accompanied by their wives and stealing things which they
sell again beggars offering themselves as guides to officers soldiers
servants marauders armies on the march in days gone by we are not
speaking of the present dragged all this behind them so that in the
special language they are called stragglers no army no nation
was responsible for those beings they spoke italian and followed the
germans then spoke french and followed the english it was by one of
these wretches a spanish straggler who spoke french that the marquis
of fervacques deceived by his picard jargon and taking him for one
of our own men was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle field
itself in the course of the night which followed the victory of
cerisoles the rascal sprang from this marauding the detestable maxim
live on the enemy produced this leprosy which a strict discipline
alone could heal there are reputations which are deceptive one does
not always know why certain generals great in other directions have
been so popular turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated
pillage evil permitted constitutes part of goodness turenne was so
good that he allowed the palatinate to be delivered over to fire and
blood the marauders in the train of an army were more or less in
number according as the chief was more or less severe hoche and
marceau had no stragglers wellington had few and we do him the justice
nevertheless on the night from the 18th to the 19th of june the dead
were robbed wellington was rigid he gave orders that any one caught in
the act should be shot but rapine is tenacious the marauders stole in
one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another
towards midnight a man was prowling about or rather climbing in the
direction of the hollow road of ohain to all appearance he was one of
those whom we have just described neither english nor french neither
peasant nor soldier less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent
of the dead bodies having theft for his victory and come to rifle
waterloo he was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat
he was uneasy and audacious he walked forwards and gazed behind him
who was this man the night probably knew more of him than the day he
had no sack but evidently he had large pockets under his coat from
time to time he halted scrutinized the plain around him as though to
see whether he were observed bent over abruptly disturbed something
silent and motionless on the ground then rose and fled his sliding
motion his attitudes his mysterious and rapid gestures caused him
to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins and which ancient
certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the
a glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived
at some distance a sort of little sutlers wagon with a fluted wicker
hood harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across
its bit as it halted hidden as it were behind the hovel which adjoins
the highway to nivelles at the angle of the road from mont saint jean
to braine lalleud and in the wagon a sort of woman seated on coffers
and packages perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and
the darkness was serene not a cloud in the zenith what matters it if
the earth be red the moon remains white these are the indifferences of
the sky in the fields branches of trees broken by grape shot but not
fallen upheld by their bark swayed gently in the breeze of night
a breath almost a respiration moved the shrubbery quivers which
resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass
in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds
hougomont and la haie sainte continued to burn forming one in the
west the other in the east two great flames which were joined by the
cordon of bivouac fires of the english like a necklace of rubies
with two carbuncles at the extremities as they extended in an immense
we have described the catastrophe of the road of ohain the heart is
terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many
if there is anything terrible if there exists a reality which surpasses
dreams it is this to live to see the sun to be in full possession
of virile force to possess health and joy to laugh valiantly to rush
towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one to feel in
ones breast lungs which breathe a heart which beats a will which
reasons to speak think hope love to have a mother to have a wife
to have children to have the light and all at once in the space of a
shout in less than a minute to sink into an abyss to fall to
roll to crush to be crushed to see ears of wheat flowers leaves
branches not to be able to catch hold of anything to feel ones sword
useless men beneath one horses on top of one to struggle in vain
since ones bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness to feel
a heel which makes ones eyes start from their sockets to bite horses
shoes in ones rage to stifle to yell to writhe to be beneath and
to say to ones self but just a little while ago i was a living man
there where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death rattle
all was silence now the edges of the hollow road were encumbered with
horses and riders inextricably heaped up terrible entanglement there
was no longer any slope for the corpses had levelled the road with the
plain and reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley a
heap of dead bodies in the upper part a river of blood in the lower
part such was that road on the evening of the 18th of june 1815 the
blood ran even to the nivelles highway and there overflowed in a large
pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way at a spot
it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point in the
direction of the genappe road that the destruction of the cuirassiers
had taken place the thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned
to the depth of the hollow road towards the middle at the point
where it became level where delorts division had passed the layer of
the nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going
in that direction he was searching that vast tomb he gazed about he
passed the dead in some sort of hideous review he walked with his feet
a few paces in front of him in the hollow road at the point where
the pile of dead came to an end an open hand illumined by the moon
projected from beneath that heap of men that hand had on its finger
something sparkling which was a ring of gold
the man bent over remained in a crouching attitude for a moment and
when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand
he did not precisely rise he remained in a stooping and frightened
attitude with his back turned to the heap of dead scanning the horizon
on his knees with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his
two forefingers which rested on the earth and his head peering above
the edge of the hollow road the jackals four paws suit some actions
then coming to a decision he rose to his feet
at that moment he gave a terrible start he felt some one clutch him
he wheeled round it was the open hand which had closed and had seized
an honest man would have been terrified this man burst into a laugh
come said he its only a dead body i prefer a spook to a
but the hand weakened and released him effort is quickly exhausted in
well now said the prowler is that dead fellow alive lets see
he bent down again fumbled among the heap pushed aside everything that
was in his way seized the hand grasped the arm freed the head pulled
out the body and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless or
at least the unconscious man through the shadows of hollow road he
was a cuirassier an officer and even an officer of considerable rank
a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass this officer
no longer possessed a helmet a furious sword cut had scarred his face
however he did not appear to have any broken limbs and by some happy
chance if that word is permissible here the dead had been vaulted
above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed his
on his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the legion of honor
the prowler tore off this cross which disappeared into one of the gulfs
then he felt of the officers fob discovered a watch there and took
possession of it next he searched his waistcoat found a purse and
when he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering
to this dying man the officer opened his eyes
the abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him the
freshness of the night the air which he could inhale freely had roused
the prowler made no reply he raised his head a sound of footsteps was
audible in the plain some patrol was probably approaching
the officer murmured for the death agony was still in his voice
look in my pockets you will find a watch and a purse take them
the prowler executed the required feint and said
i have been robbed said the officer i am sorry for that you should
the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct
some one is coming said the prowler with the movement of a man who
the officer raised his arm feebly and detained him
you have saved my life who are you
the prowler answered rapidly and in a low voice
like yourself i belonged to the french army i must leave you if they
were to catch me they would shoot me i have saved your life now get
i shall not forget that name said the officer and do you remember
the reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad
details we will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs
published by the journals of that day a few months after the surprising
events which had taken place at m sur m
these articles are rather summary it must be remembered that at that
epoch the gazette des tribunaux was not yet in existence
we borrow the first from the drapeau blanc it bears the date of july
