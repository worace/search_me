sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son
which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on
prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out
as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and
especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity
and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
so youve decided to go andrew asked his sister
thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you
why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when
you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle
bourienne says he has been asking about you
as soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears
began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room
ah my god my god when one thinks who and what what trash can cause
people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary
she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to
mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man who
andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching his
elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears i
understand you she looked down dont imagine that sorrow is the
work of men men are his tools she looked a little above prince
andrews head with the confident accustomed look with which one looks
at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by him
not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you think
someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to
punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving
if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a womans virtue but a
man should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though
till that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his unexpended
if mary is already persuading me to forgive it means that i ought long
ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further reply
he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
kuragin who he knew was now in the army
princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how
unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to
him but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
from the army and would certainly write to his father but that the
longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become
good bye andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are
never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he
then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the
avenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature is
left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the old
man feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up
and rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
deceived and i am off to the army why i myself dont know i want to
meet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and
these conditions of life had been the same before but then they were
all connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless
things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to
prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of
june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified
camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a
junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course
of affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger of
invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war would
extend farther than the western the polish provinces
prince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned on
the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large village
in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and
courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclay
de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received
bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment
but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kuragin whom
prince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he had
gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mind
was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a
gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the
distraction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first four
days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the
whole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks
with experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but the
question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained
for him undecided already from his military experience and what he had
seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war
the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all
depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be
foreseen are met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled
to clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his
position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control
of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced for
himself the following of the state of affairs
while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided
into three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the
army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the
emperor was with the first army but not as commander in chief in the
orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take command
but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with
him not a commander in chiefs staff but the imperial headquarters
staff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff
quartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperial
aides de camp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners
but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the
emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the ex minister of
war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duke
stein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel
the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant general
and sardinian emigre wolzogen and many others though these men had no
military appointment in the army their position gave them influence
and often a corps commander or even the commander in chief did not
know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke
arakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and did
not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated
from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be
executed or not but this was only the external condition the essential
significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people
from a courtiers point of view and in an emperors vicinity all became
courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not
assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies
the men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithful
custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereigns bodyguard
bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing
the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as
an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was
there because it suited him to be the ex minister stein was there
because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high
esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general
full of self confidence a quality that always influenced alexander
paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the
adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up
the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to
believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business
of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed pfuels thoughts in a
more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish
theorist self confident to the point of despising everyone else was
besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
ideas every day especially the foreigners who did so with a boldness
characteristic of people employed in a country not their own there were
many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
among the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and
proud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined
the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherents military theorists
who believed in a science of war with immutable laws laws of oblique
movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded
a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
laws defined by a pseudo theory of war and they saw only barbarism
ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to
this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and
the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as
always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of
this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland
and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold
action this section also represented nationalism which made them still
more one sided in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolov
who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a
famous joke of ermolovs was being circulated that as a great favor he
had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party
remembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason or
stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of
russia and not let the army get discouraged
to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged
the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two
the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev
belonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to
seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war
particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him
bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific
knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time
it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided and
therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen
to what pfuels opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had
to say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention
of the camp at drissa according to pfuels plan but on changing the
movements of the other armies though by this course neither one aim
nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of
of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
tsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where
he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry
uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but
unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and
the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon
recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so
they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this
we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only
reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible
this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for other
reasons of state was in favor of peace
the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de
tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an
honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power
for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and
he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well
organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any
defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be
superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his
the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any
rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and
twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually
let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our
retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any
rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this
what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen
who made his mark in 1807 and to whom napoleon himself did justice a
man whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the
the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be
found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were
particularly many round alexander generals and imperial aides de camp
passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a
man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in
1805 and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human
capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for
refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive
modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander in chiefs
staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be
the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the
others as ninety nine to one consisted of men who desired neither peace
nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or
anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor
bennigsen but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and
pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of
conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors
headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would
today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after
merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare
that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain
some advantage would attract the emperors attention by loudly
advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and
would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and
challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving
that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third
in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a
special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that
moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly
overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperors
eye a fifth to achieve his long cherished aim of dining with the
emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and
promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole
drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was
all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the
uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving
a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of
intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of
race among these people this eighth and largest party of those
preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and
obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these
drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew
over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the
army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to
raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men
experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of
those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what
was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of
escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness
the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
chiefly from the emperors presence in the army with his military court
and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional
and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but
harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the
army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor
and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor
paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
personal safety and that the worst commander in chief if independent
would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa
shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of
this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev
agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him
by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully
suggested on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
a warlike spirit in the people of the capital that the emperor should
that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to
defend their country the very incitement which was the chief cause of
russias triumph in so far as it was produced by the tsars personal
presence in moscow was suggested to the emperor and accepted by him
this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one
day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him
personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to
present himself at bennigsens quarters at six that evening
news was received at the emperors quarters that very day of a fresh
movement by napoleon which might endanger the army news subsequently
found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the
drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that
this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered a
chef doeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleons
destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the
prince andrew arrived at bennigsens quarters a country gentlemans
house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither
bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the emperors aide
de camp received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor
accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second
time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the
suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt
chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel
in his hand this room had probably been a music room there was still
an organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stood
the folding bedstead of bennigsens adjutant this adjutant was also
there and sat dozing on the rolled up bedding evidently exhausted by
work or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on into
what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study
through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and
occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the
emperors wish not a military council the emperor preferred
indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
view of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but as
it were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor
personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general
armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had
referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein
who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince
andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew
had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon
after himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a
at first sight pfuel in his ill made uniform of a russian general
which fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince
andrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about him
something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german
theorist generals whom prince andrew had seen in 1805 but he was more
typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german
theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
pfuel was short and very thin but broad boned of coarse robust build
broad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much
wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastily
brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint
little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily
around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly
holding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where
the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms
as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down
to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded
hurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that
the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had
planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself
abruptly and in a bass voice as self assured germans do it might have
been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or
something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what
he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to
pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the
war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glanced not so much at
prince andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been
a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the
room from which the sound of voices was heard
pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly
disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with
pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to
form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly
and immutably self confident men self confident to the point of
martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are self confident
on the basis of an abstract notion science that is the supposed
knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is self assured because he
regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly
attractive to men and women an englishman is self assured as being a
citizen of the best organized state in the world and therefore as an
englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as
an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is self assured because
he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian
is self assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know
anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the
germans self assurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsive
than any other because he imagines that he knows the truth science
which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth
pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of
oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the
greats wars and all he came across in the history of more recent
warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in
which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars
could not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and
therefore could not serve as material for science
in 1806 pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of
campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least
proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on
the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion
the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically
gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would
go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their
theory that they lose sight of the theorys object its practical
application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and
he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures
resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present
war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong
and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of
hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples
he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his
prince andrews eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when
count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkonski but not
pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he
went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to
make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign
chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor
who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to
him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the
left was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward
evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited
italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak
and as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp
said paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince
andrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sire
continued paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself
the man who advised the drissa camp i see no alternative but the
without heeding the end of the italians remarks and as though not
hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkonski addressed him
i am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait
the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter
mikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein and the door closed behind them
prince andrew taking advantage of the emperors permission accompanied
paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the
prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it were
of chief of the emperors staff he came out of the study into the
drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put
questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be
false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to
the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty that
presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away
from the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this was
inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have an
opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that
plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
put which in fact his plan did not answer as to avail himself of the
opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as
good as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what
character the war would take some disputed his arguments others
defended them young count toll objected to the swedish generals views
more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from
his side pocket a well filled notebook which he asked permission to
read to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme
totally different from armfeldts or pfuels plan of campaign in answer
to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged
could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap
as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated
during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his
bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted
contemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demean
himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when
prince volkonski who was in the chair called on him to give his
why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an
exposed rear or why not this italian gentlemans attack very fine or
a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know
but when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the emperors name
that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated
everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they
knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters there
is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly
adhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers what
he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that
everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to
outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed
paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french
wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badly
and began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel who
was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all
that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if there
were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he
demonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like a
mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a
problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and
continued to explain his views in french every now and then turning to
pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a man
heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily at
well of course what more is there to explain
paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french
armfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkonski in
russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence
of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry
determined and absurdly self confident as he was of all those present
evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no
hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on a
theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he was
ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary
respect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks
of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at
the council of war in 1805 there was now a panic fear of napoleons
genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder
everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him
from every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each others
proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like
everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of
respect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the
courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to
speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in
pfuels own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel
himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his self confidence
and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly
brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he
concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was
evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world
the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the
more heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and
personalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this
polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts
felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had
long since and often occurred to him during his military activities the
idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that
therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius now appeared
to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a
matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
the enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge the
force of this or that detachment sometimes when there is not a coward
at the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a brave
and jolly lad who shouts hurrah a detachment of five thousand is
worth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fifty
thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can
there be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can
be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions the
significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives
no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and paulucci
says we have got the french army between two fires michaud says that
the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it
and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes one
plan armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and the
advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial
and why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius who
can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
to the right and who to the left it is only because military men are
invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power
attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best
generals i have known were on the contrary stupid or absent minded
men bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and of
bonaparte himself i remember his limited self satisfied face on the
field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any
special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
and best human attributes love poetry tenderness and philosophic
inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he is
doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient
patience and only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he
should be humane should love or pity or think of what is just and
unjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius was
invented for them long ago because they have power the success of a
military action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks who
shouts we are lost or who shouts hurrah and only in the ranks
can one serve with assurance of being useful
so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he roused
himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving
at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would
like to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles
forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns person but
before the beginning of the campaign rostov had received a letter from
his parents in which they told him briefly of natashas illness and the
breaking off of her engagement to prince andrew which they explained by
natashas having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire from
the army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did not
even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
army but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and her
engagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their
adored friend of my soul he wrote nothing but honor could keep me
from returning to the country but now at the commencement of the
campaign i should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but in
my own if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the
fatherland but this shall be our last separation believe me directly
the war is over if i am still alive and still loved by you i will
throw up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardent
it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying sonya the
autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas
holidays and sonyas love had opened out to him a vista of tranquil
rural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which now
allured him a splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozen
leashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by
election thought he but now the campaign was beginning and he had
to remain with his regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostov
as was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in the
regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life
on his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed
by his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the
ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation
from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captain
and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in
numbers he was again allotted his old squadron
the campaign began the regiment was moved into poland on double pay
new officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody was
infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
of a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous position in the
regiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
military service though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
the troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of state
political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a
complicated interplay of interests arguments and passions at
headquarters for the pavlograd hussars however the whole of this
retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies
it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and
intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where
they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat it was only
because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or some
pretty young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chanced
to enter anyones head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only of
the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna making
acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being
reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders then came an order to
retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry
away with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the
drunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there and
because many complaints were made against the troops who taking
advantage of the order to collect provisions took also horses
carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostov remembered
sventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
men of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels
of old beer from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissa
and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russia
on the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious action
on the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there was a heavy
storm of rain and hail in general the summer of 1812 was remarkable
the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye which
was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov with a young
officer named ilyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructed
shelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extending
onto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
i have come from the staff count have you heard of raevskis
and the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle which he had
rostov smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
trickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasional
glance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a lad of
sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the same
relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years
before ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as a
zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of
the saltanov dam being a russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthy
of antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted how
raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
charged with them beside him rostov heard the story and not only said
nothing to encourage zdrzhinskis enthusiasm but on the contrary
looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with no
intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of
1807 rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing
military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides
that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like zdrzhinskis
tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustaches
extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as was
his habit and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at him
in silence in the first place there must have been such a confusion
and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did lead
his sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or
with whom raevski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would
not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with
raevskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger
and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they
took the saltanov dam or not as we are told was the case at
thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose
his own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother petya
there or even ilyin whos a stranger to me but a nice lad but would
have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to
think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express his
thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knew
that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly
i cant stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostov did not
relish zdrzhinskis conversation my stockings and shirt and the
water is running on my seat ill go and look for shelter the rain
five minutes later ilyin splashing through the mud came running back
hurrah rostov come quick ive found it about two hundred yards away
theres a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get
mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young
german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of
means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the
early days of their marriage took her about with him wherever the
hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrushka to
follow with the things and now slipping in the mud now splashing
right through it set off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the
darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning
here what lightning they called to one another
in the tavern before which stood the doctors covered cart there were
already some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blonde
german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad bench
in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind her
rostov and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts
dear me how jolly we are said rostov laughing
what swells they are why the water streams from them dont make our
dont mess mary hendrikhovnas dress cried other voices
rostov and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into
dry clothes without offending mary hendrikhovnas modesty they were
going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it
completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no
account yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the
loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen
rostov and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits
a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found
fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was
produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary
hendrikhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a
clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacket
under her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coat
over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the flies
off her husbands face lest he should wake up
leave him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happily
he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night
oh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one must look after
the doctor perhaps hell take pity on me someday when it comes to
cutting off a leg or an arm for me
there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could
not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held
only six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take
turns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from mary
hendrikhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overclean
nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with
her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon
left their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the general
mood of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself surrounded by
such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as
she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her
there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything else
but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary
hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostov received
his tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir
but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if
everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
it is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stir
mary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone
use your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer said
ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to
mary hendrikhovna asking her to stir it with her finger
this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill drink it
when they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards and
proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they drew
lots to settle who should make up her set at rostovs suggestion it was
agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss mary
hendrikhovnas hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheat
the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke
well but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyin
as it is she is queen and her word is law
they had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head
suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awake for
some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing
entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad and
depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked
to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had
left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary
hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became
still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told
his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him in
alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must go
to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen
but ill send an orderly two of them said rostov what an idea
ill stand guard on it myself said ilyin
no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two
nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife
seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grew
still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for
which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking
his wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cart
the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet
cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchanged
remarks recalling the doctors uneasiness and his wifes delight now
they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
covered trap several times rostov covering his head tried to go to
sleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter
it was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the
quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of
ostrovna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedly
getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but
rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was
breaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt
damp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they left
the tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostov and ilyin both glanced
under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctors cart from
under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle
of which his wifes nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing
she really is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who was
