strange figure that uttered it and from both figure and language at once
guessed the craze of their owner they wished however to learn quietly
what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them and one
of them who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp witted said to
him sir knight we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of
show her to us for if she be of such beauty as you suggest with all
our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on
if i were to show her to you replied don quixote what merit would
you have in confessing a truth so manifest the essential point is that
without seeing her you must believe confess affirm swear and defend
it else ye have to do with me in battle ill conditioned arrogant
rabble that ye are and come ye on one by one as the order of knighthood
requires or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed
here do i bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause i
sir knight replied the trader i entreat your worship in the name of
this present company of princes that to save us from charging our
consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard
of and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the empresses and queens
of the alcarria and estremadura your worship will be pleased to show us
some portrait of this lady though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat
for by the thread one gets at the ball and in this way we shall be
satisfied and easy and you will be content and pleased nay i believe
we are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait
should show her blind of one eye and distilling vermilion and sulphur
from the other we would nevertheless to gratify your worship say all
she distils nothing of the kind vile rabble said don quixote burning
with rage nothing of the kind i say only ambergris and civet in
cotton nor is she one eyed or humpbacked but straighter than a
guadarrama spindle but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered
and so saying he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
spoken with such fury and fierceness that if luck had not contrived
that rocinante should stumble midway and come down it would have gone
hard with the rash trader down went rocinante and over went his master
rolling along the ground for some distance and when he tried to rise he
was unable so encumbered was he with lance buckler spurs helmet and
the weight of his old armour and all the while he was struggling to get
up he kept saying fly not cowards and caitiffs stay for not by my
fault but my horses am i stretched here
one of the muleteers in attendance who could not have had much good
nature in him hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style
was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs and coming
up to him he seized his lance and having broken it in pieces with one
of them he began so to belabour our don quixote that notwithstanding and
in spite of his armour he milled him like a measure of wheat his
masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone but the
muleteers blood was up and he did not care to drop the game until he had
vented the rest of his wrath and gathering up the remaining fragments of
the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim who all
through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening
heaven and earth and the brigands for such they seemed to him at last
the muleteer was tired and the traders continued their journey taking
with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled
he when he found himself alone made another effort to rise but if he was
unable when whole and sound how was he to rise after having been
thrashed and well nigh knocked to pieces and yet he esteemed himself
fortunate as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight errants
mishap and entirely he considered the fault of his horse however
battered in body as he was to rise was beyond his power
in which the narrative of our knights mishap is continued
finding then that in fact he could not move he thought himself of
having recourse to his usual remedy which was to think of some passage
in his books and his craze brought to his mind that about baldwin and
the marquis of mantua when carloto left him wounded on the mountain
side a story known by heart by the children not forgotten by the young
men and lauded and even believed by the old folk and for all that not a
whit truer than the miracles of mahomet this seemed to him to fit
exactly the case in which he found himself so making a show of severe
suffering he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat
the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have
and so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines
as chance would have it when he had got to this line there happened to
come by a peasant from his own village a neighbour of his who had been
with a load of wheat to the mill and he seeing the man stretched there
came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him
don quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the marquis of mantua his
uncle so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad in which
he told the tale of his misfortune and of the loves of the emperors son
and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it
the peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense and relieving him of
the visor already battered to pieces by blows he wiped his face which
was covered with dust and as soon as he had done so he recognised him
and said senor quixada for so he appears to have been called when he
was in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman
into a knight errant who has brought your worship to this pass but
to all questions the other only went on with his ballad
seeing this the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and
backpiece to see if he had any wound but he could perceive no blood nor
any mark whatever he then contrived to raise him from the ground and
with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass which seemed to him
to be the easiest mount for him and collecting the arms even to the
splinters of the lance he tied them on rocinante and leading him by the
bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village very
sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixote was talking
nor was don quixote less so for what with blows and bruises he could not
sit upright on the ass and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven
so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him and it
could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to
match his own adventures for now forgetting baldwin he bethought
himself of the moor abindarraez when the alcaide of antequera rodrigo
de narvaez took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle so that
when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him he gave
him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive abindarraez
gave to rodrigo de narvaez just as he had read the story in the diana
of jorge de montemayor where it is written applying it to his own case
so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to
listen to such a lot of nonsense from which however he came to the
conclusion that his neighbour was mad and so made all haste to reach the
village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixotes
who at the end of it said senor don rodrigo de narvaez your worship
must know that this fair xarifa i have mentioned is now the lovely
dulcinea del toboso for whom i have done am doing and will do the most
famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen are to be
to this the peasant answered senor sinner that i am cannot your
worship see that i am not don rodrigo de narvaez nor the marquis of
mantua but pedro alonso your neighbour and that your worship is neither
baldwin nor abindarraez but the worthy gentleman senor quixada
i know who i am replied don quixote and i know that i may be not
only those i have named but all the twelve peers of france and even all
the nine worthies since my achievements surpass all that they have done
all together and each of them on his own account
with this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as
night was beginning to fall but the peasant waited until it was a little
later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a
miserable trim when it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered
the village and went to don quixotes house which he found all in
confusion and there were the curate and the village barber who were
great friends of don quixote and his housekeeper was saying to them in a
loud voice what does your worship think can have befallen my master
senor licentiate pero perez for so the curate was called it is three
days now since anything has been seen of him or the hack or the
buckler lance or armour miserable me i am certain of it and it is as
true as that i was born to die that these accursed books of chivalry he
has and has got into the way of reading so constantly have upset his
reason for now i remember having often heard him saying to himself that
he would turn knight errant and go all over the world in quest of
adventures to the devil and barabbas with such books that have brought
to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all la mancha
the niece said the same and more you must know master nicholas for
that was the name of the barber it was often my uncles way to stay two
days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures
after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall
to slashing the walls and when he was tired out he would say he had
killed four giants like four towers and the sweat that flowed from him
when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in
battle and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm
and quiet saying that this water was a most precious potion which the
sage esquife a great magician and friend of his had brought him but i
take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my
uncles vagaries that you might put a stop to them before things had
come to this pass and burn all these accursed books for he has a great
number that richly deserve to be burned like heretics
so say i too said the curate and by my faith to morrow shall not
pass without public judgment upon them and may they be condemned to the
flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems
all this the peasant heard and from it he understood at last what was
the matter with his neighbour so he began calling aloud open your
worships to senor baldwin and to senor the marquis of mantua who comes
badly wounded and to senor abindarraez the moor whom the valiant
rodrigo de narvaez the alcaide of antequera brings captive
at these words they all hurried out and when they recognised their
friend master and uncle who had not yet dismounted from the ass
because he could not they ran to embrace him
hold said he for i am badly wounded through my horses fault carry
me to bed and if possible send for the wise urganda to cure and see to
see there plague on it cried the housekeeper at this did not my
heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of to bed with
your worship at once and we will contrive to cure you here without
fetching that hurgada a curse i say once more and a hundred times more
on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a
they carried him to bed at once and after searching for his wounds could
find none but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe
fall with his horse rocinante when in combat with ten giants the biggest
and the boldest to be found on earth
so so said the curate are there giants in the dance by the sign of
the cross i will burn them to morrow before the day over
they put a host of questions to don quixote but his only answer to all
was give him something to eat and leave him to sleep for that was what
he needed most they did so and the curate questioned the peasant at
great length as to how he had found don quixote he told him and the
nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home all which made the
licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day which was to
summon his friend the barber master nicholas and go with him to don
of the diverting and important scrutiny which the curate and the barber
made in the library of our ingenious gentleman
he was still sleeping so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the
room where the books the authors of all the mischief were and right
willingly she gave them they all went in the housekeeper with them and
found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound and some
other small ones the moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about
and ran out of the room and came back immediately with a saucer of holy
water and a sprinkler saying here your worship senor licentiate
sprinkle this room dont leave any magician of the many there are in
these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them
the simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh and he
directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they
were about as there might be some to be found among them that did not
no said the niece there is no reason for showing mercy to any of
them they have every one of them done mischief better fling them out of
the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them
or else carry them into the yard and there a bonfire can be made without
the smoke giving any annoyance the housekeeper said the same so eager
were they both for the slaughter of those innocents but the curate would
not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles
the first that master nicholas put into his hand was the four books of
amadis of gaul this seems a mysterious thing said the curate for
as i have heard say this was the first book of chivalry printed in
spain and from this all the others derive their birth and origin so it
seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the
nay sir said the barber i too have heard say that this is the best
of all the books of this kind that have been written and so as
something singular in its line it ought to be pardoned
true said the curate and for that reason let its life be spared for
the present let us see that other which is next to it
it is said the barber the sergas de esplandian the lawful son of
then verily said the curate the merit of the father must not be put
down to the account of the son take it mistress housekeeper open the
window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for
the housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction and the worthy
esplandian went flying into the yard to await with all patience the
this that comes next said the barber is amadis of greece and
indeed i believe all those on this side are of the same amadis lineage
then to the yard with the whole of them said the curate for to have
the burning of queen pintiquiniestra and the shepherd darinel and his
eclogues and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author i
would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in
i am of the same mind said the barber
in that case said the housekeeper here into the yard with them
they were handed to her and as there were many of them she spared
herself the staircase and flung them down out of the window
who is that tub there said the curate
this said the barber is don olivante de laura
the author of that book said the curate was the same that wrote the
garden of flowers and truly there is no deciding which of the two books
is the more truthful or to put it better the less lying all i can say
is send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool
this that follows is florismarte of hircania said the barber
senor florismarte here said the curate then by my faith he must take
up his quarters in the yard in spite of his marvellous birth and
visionary adventures for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve
nothing else into the yard with him and the other mistress
with all my heart senor said she and executed the order with great
this said the barber is the knight platir
an old book that said the curate but i find no reason for clemency
in it send it after the others without appeal which was done
another book was opened and they saw it was entitled the knight of the
for the sake of the holy name this book has said the curate its
ignorance might be excused but then they say behind the cross theres
taking down another book the barber said this is the mirror of
i know his worship said the curate that is where senor reinaldos of
montalvan figures with his friends and comrades greater thieves than
cacus and the twelve peers of france with the veracious historian
turpin however i am not for condemning them to more than perpetual
banishment because at any rate they have some share in the invention
of the famous matteo boiardo whence too the christian poet ludovico
ariosto wove his web to whom if i find him here and speaking any
language but his own i shall show no respect whatever but if he speaks
his own tongue i will put him upon my head
well i have him in italian said the barber but i do not understand
nor would it be well that you should understand him said the curate
and on that score we might have excused the captain if he had not
brought him into spain and turned him into castilian he robbed him of a
great deal of his natural force and so do all those who try to turn
books written in verse into another language for with all the pains
they take and all the cleverness they show they never can reach the
level of the originals as they were first produced in short i say that
this book and all that may be found treating of those french affairs
should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well until after more
consideration it is settled what is to be done with them excepting
always one bernardo del carpio that is going about and another called
roncesvalles for these if they come into my hands shall pass at once
into those of the housekeeper and from hers into the fire without any
to all this the barber gave his assent and looked upon it as right and
proper being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the faith and
loyal to the truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed
to them opening another book he saw it was palmerin de oliva and
beside it was another called palmerin of england seeing which the
licentiate said let the olive be made firewood of at once and burned
until no ashes even are left and let that palm of england be kept and
preserved as a thing that stands alone and let such another case be made
for it as that which alexander found among the spoils of darius and set
aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet homer this book
gossip is of authority for two reasons first because it is very good
and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty
king of portugal all the adventures at the castle of miraguarda are
excellent and of admirable contrivance and the language is polished and
clear studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with
propriety and judgment so then provided it seems good to you master
nicholas i say let this and amadis of gaul be remitted the penalty of
fire and as for all the rest let them perish without further question
nay gossip said the barber for this that i have here is the famous
well said the curate that and the second third and fourth parts
all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile and
they must be cleared of all that stuff about the castle of fame and other
greater affectations to which end let them be allowed the over seas
term and according as they mend so shall mercy or justice be meted out
to them and in the mean time gossip do you keep them in your house and
with all my heart said the barber and not caring to tire himself with
reading more books of chivalry he told the housekeeper to take all the
big ones and throw them into the yard it was not said to one dull or
deaf but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest
and finest web that could be and seizing about eight at a time she
in carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber
who took it up curious to know whose it was and found it said history
god bless me said the curate with a shout tirante el blanco here
hand it over gossip for in it i reckon i have found a treasury of
enjoyment and a mine of recreation here is don kyrieleison of montalvan
a valiant knight and his brother thomas of montalvan and the knight
fonseca with the battle the bold tirante fought with the mastiff and
the witticisms of the damsel placerdemivida and the loves and wiles of
the widow reposada and the empress in love with the squire hipolito in
truth gossip by right of its style it is the best book in the world
here knights eat and sleep and die in their beds and make their wills
before dying and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the
other books nevertheless i say he who wrote it for deliberately
composing such fooleries deserves to be sent to the galleys for life
take it home with you and read it and you will see that what i have said
as you will said the barber but what are we to do with these little
these must be not chivalry but poetry said the curate and opening
one he saw it was the diana of jorge de montemayor and supposing all
the others to be of the same sort these he said do not deserve to
be burned like the others for they neither do nor can do the mischief
the books of chivalry have done being books of entertainment that can
ah senor said the niece your worship had better order these to be
burned as well as the others for it would be no wonder if after being
cured of his chivalry disorder my uncle by reading these took a fancy
to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping or
what would be still worse to turn poet which they say is an incurable
the damsel is right said the curate and it will be well to put this
stumbling block and temptation out of our friends way to begin then
with the diana of montemayor i am of opinion it should not be burned
but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage felicia and the
magic water and of almost all the longer pieces of verse let it keep
and welcome its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the
this that comes next said the barber is the diana entitled the
second part by the salamancan and this other has the same title and
as for that of the salamancan replied the curate let it go to swell
the number of the condemned in the yard and let gil polos be preserved
as if it came from apollo himself but get on gossip and make haste
this book said the barber opening another is the ten books of the
fortune of love written by antonio de lofraso a sardinian poet
by the orders i have received said the curate since apollo has been
apollo and the muses have been muses and poets have been poets so
droll and absurd a book as this has never been written and in its way it
is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet
appeared and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what
is delightful give it here gossip for i make more account of having
found it than if they had given me a cassock of florence stuff
he put it aside with extreme satisfaction and the barber went on these
that come next are the shepherd of iberia nymphs of henares and
then all we have to do said the curate is to hand them over to the
secular arm of the housekeeper and ask me not why or we shall never
no pastor that said the curate but a highly polished courtier let
this large one here said the barber is called the treasury of
if there were not so many of them said the curate they would be more
relished this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities
which it has with its excellences let it be preserved because the author
is a friend of mine and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier
this continued the barber is the cancionero of lopez de
the author of that book too said the curate is a great friend of
mine and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who
hear them for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when
he chants them it gives rather too much of its eclogues but what is
good was never yet plentiful let it be kept with those that have been
set apart but what book is that next it
the galatea of miguel de cervantes said the barber
that cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine and to my
knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses his book
has some good invention in it it presents us with something but brings
nothing to a conclusion we must wait for the second part it promises
perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of
grace that is now denied it and in the mean time do you senor gossip
keep it shut up in your own quarters
very good said the barber and here come three together the
araucana of don alonso de ercilla the austriada of juan rufo
justice of cordova and the montserrate of christobal de virues the
these three books said the curate are the best that have been
written in castilian in heroic verse and they may compare with the most
famous of italy let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry
the curate was tired and would not look into any more books and so he
decided that contents uncertified all the rest should be burned but
just then the barber held open one called the tears of angelica
i should have shed tears myself said the curate when he heard the
title had i ordered that book to be burned for its author was one of
the famous poets of the world not to say of spain and was very happy in
of the second sally of our worthy knight don quixote of la mancha
at this instant don quixote began shouting out here here valiant
knights here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms
for they of the court are gaining the mastery in the tourney called
away by this noise and outcry they proceeded no farther with the
scrutiny of the remaining books and so it is thought that the carolea
the lion of spain and the deeds of the emperor written by don luis
de avila went to the fire unseen and unheard for no doubt they were
among those that remained and perhaps if the curate had seen them they
would not have undergone so severe a sentence
when they reached don quixote he was already out of bed and was still
shouting and raving and slashing and cutting all round as wide awake as
they closed with him and by force got him back to bed and when he had
become a little calm addressing the curate he said to him of a truth
senor archbishop turpin it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves
the twelve peers so carelessly to allow the knights of the court to gain
the victory in this tourney we the adventurers having carried off the
hush gossip said the curate please god the luck may turn and what
is lost to day may be won to morrow for the present let your worship
have a care of your health for it seems to me that you are
wounded no said don quixote but bruised and battered no doubt for
that bastard don roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree
and all for envy because he sees that i alone rival him in his
achievements but i should not call myself reinaldos of montalvan did he
not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as i rise from
this bed for the present let them bring me something to eat for that i
feel is what will be more to my purpose and leave it to me to avenge
they did as he wished they gave him something to eat and once more he
fell asleep leaving them marvelling at his madness
that night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the
yard and in the whole house and some must have been consumed that
deserved preservation in everlasting archives but their fate and the
laziness of the examiner did not permit it and so in them was verified
the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty
one of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied
to their friends disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the
books were so that when he got up he should not find them possibly the
cause being removed the effect might cease and they might say that a
magician had carried them off room and all and this was done with all
despatch two days later don quixote got up and the first thing he did
was to go and look at his books and not finding the room where he had
left it he wandered from side to side looking for it he came to the
place where the door used to be and tried it with his hands and turned
and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word but after
a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held
the housekeeper who had been already well instructed in what she was to
answer said what room or what nothing is it that your worship is
looking for there are neither room nor books in this house now for the
it was not the devil said the niece but a magician who came on a
cloud one night after the day your worship left this and dismounting
from a serpent that he rode he entered the room and what he did there i
know not but after a little while he made off flying through the roof
and left the house full of smoke and when we went to see what he had
done we saw neither book nor room but we remember very well the
housekeeper and i that on leaving the old villain said in a loud voice
that for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room
he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by and by he
said too that his name was the sage munaton
he must have said friston said don quixote
i dont know whether he called himself friston or friton said the
housekeeper i only know that his name ended with ton
so it does said don quixote and he is a sage magician a great enemy
of mine who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore
that in process of time i am to engage in single combat with a knight
whom he befriends and that i am to conquer and he will be unable to
prevent it and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns
that he can but i promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid
who doubts that said the niece but uncle who mixes you up in these
quarrels would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house
instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of
wheat never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn
oh niece of mine replied don quixote how much astray art thou in
thy reckoning ere they shear me i shall have plucked away and stripped
off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine
the two were unwilling to make any further answer as they saw that his
in short then he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without
showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions and
during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips the
curate and the barber on the point he maintained that knights errant
were what the world stood most in need of and that in him was to be
accomplished the revival of knight errantry the curate sometimes
contradicted him sometimes agreed with him for if he had not observed
this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason
meanwhile don quixote worked upon a farm labourer a neighbour of his an
honest man if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor but
with very little wit in his pate in a word he so talked him over and
with such persuasions and promises that the poor clown made up his mind
to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire don quixote among
other things told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly
because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in
the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it on these and the
like promises sancho panza for so the labourer was called left wife and
children and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour
don quixote next set about getting some money and selling one thing and
pawning another and making a bad bargain in every case he got together
a fair sum he provided himself with a buckler which he begged as a loan
from a friend and restoring his battered helmet as best he could he
warned his squire sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out that he
might provide himself with what he thought most needful above all he
charged him to take alforjas with him the other said he would and that
he meant to take also a very good ass he had as he was not much given to
going on foot about the ass don quixote hesitated a little trying
whether he could call to mind any knight errant taking with him an
esquire mounted on ass back but no instance occurred to his memory for
all that however he determined to take him intending to furnish him
with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself by
appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered
himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could
according to the advice the host had given him all which being done
without taking leave sancho panza of his wife and children or don
quixote of his housekeeper and niece they sallied forth unseen by
anybody from the village one night and made such good way in the course
of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery even
sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch with his alforjas and bota and
longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had
promised him don quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he
had taken on his first journey that over the campo de montiel which he
travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion for as it was
early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely the heat
and now said sancho panza to his master your worship will take care
senor knight errant not to forget about the island you have promised me
for be it ever so big ill be equal to governing it
to which don quixote replied thou must know friend sancho panza that
it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights errant of old to
make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won and i
am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a
custom on the contrary i mean to improve upon it for they sometimes
and perhaps most frequently waited until their squires were old and
then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights
they gave them some title or other of count or at the most marquis of
some valley or province more or less but if thou livest and i live it
may well be that before six days are over i may have won some kingdom
that has others dependent upon it which will be just the thing to enable
thee to be crowned king of one of them nor needst thou count this
wonderful for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways
so unexampled and unexpected that i might easily give thee even more than
in that case said sancho panza if i should become a king by one of
those miracles your worship speaks of even juana gutierrez my old
woman would come to be queen and my children infantes
i doubt it replied sancho panza because for my part i am persuaded
that though god should shower down kingdoms upon earth not one of them
would fit the head of mari gutierrez let me tell you senor she is not
worth two maravedis for a queen countess will fit her better and that
leave it to god sancho returned don quixote for he will give her
what suits her best but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to
be content with anything less than being governor of a province
i will not senor answered sancho specially as i have a man of such
quality for a master in your worship who will know how to give me all
that will be suitable for me and that i can bear
of the good fortune which the valiant don quixote had in the terrible and
undreamt of adventure of the windmills with other occurrences worthy to
at this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are
on plain and as soon as don quixote saw them he said to his squire
fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our
desires ourselves for look there friend sancho panza where thirty or
more monstrous giants present themselves all of whom i mean to engage in
battle and slay and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our
fortunes for this is righteous warfare and it is gods good service to
sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth
those thou seest there answered his master with the long arms and
look your worship said sancho what we see there are not giants but
windmills and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by
it is easy to see replied don quixote that thou art not used to this
business of adventures those are giants and if thou art afraid away
with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while i engage them in
so saying he gave the spur to his steed rocinante heedless of the cries
his squire sancho sent after him warning him that most certainly they
were windmills and not giants he was going to attack he however was so
positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of sancho nor
perceived near as he was what they were but made at them shouting
fly not cowards and vile beings for a single knight attacks you
a slight breeze at this moment sprang up and the great sails began to
move seeing which don quixote exclaimed though ye flourish more arms
than the giant briareus ye have to reckon with me
so saying and commending himself with all his heart to his lady
dulcinea imploring her to support him in such a peril with lance in
rest and covered by his buckler he charged at rocinantes fullest gallop
and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him but as he drove
his lance point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force
that it shivered the lance to pieces sweeping with it horse and rider
who went rolling over on the plain in a sorry condition sancho hastened
to his assistance as fast as his ass could go and when he came up found
him unable to move with such a shock had rocinante fallen with him
god bless me said sancho did i not tell your worship to mind what
you were about for they were only windmills and no one could have made
any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his
hush friend sancho replied don quixote the fortunes of war more
than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations and moreover i think
and it is the truth that that same sage friston who carried off my study
and books has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the
glory of vanquishing them such is the enmity he bears me but in the end
his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword
god order it as he may said sancho panza and helping him to rise got
him up again on rocinante whose shoulder was half out and then
discussing the late adventure they followed the road to puerto lapice
for there said don quixote they could not fail to find adventures in
abundance and variety as it was a great thoroughfare for all that he
was much grieved at the loss of his lance and saying so to his squire
he added i remember having read how a spanish knight diego perez de
vargas by name having broken his sword in battle tore from an oak a
ponderous bough or branch and with it did such things that day and
pounded so many moors that he got the surname of machuca and he and his
descendants from that day forth were called vargas y machuca i mention
this because from the first oak i see i mean to rend such another branch
large and stout like that with which i am determined and resolved to do
such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found
worthy to come and see them and be an eyewitness of things that will
be that as god will said sancho i believe it all as your worship
says it but straighten yourself a little for you seem all on one side
may be from the shaking of the fall
that is the truth said don quixote and if i make no complaint of the
pain it is because knights errant are not permitted to complain of any
wound even though their bowels be coming out through it
if so said sancho i have nothing to say but god knows i would
rather your worship complained when anything ailed you for my part i
confess i must complain however small the ache may be unless this rule
about not complaining extends to the squires of knights errant also
don quixote could not help laughing at his squires simplicity and he
assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose just as he
liked for so far he had never read of anything to the contrary in the
sancho bade him remember it was dinner time to which his master answered
that he wanted nothing himself just then but that he might eat when he
had a mind with this permission sancho settled himself as comfortably as
he could on his beast and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed
away in them he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately
and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the
thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envied and while he went on in
this way gulping down draught after draught he never gave a thought to
any of the promises his master had made him nor did he rate it as
hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures however
dangerous they might be finally they passed the night among some trees
from one of which don quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a
fashion as a lance and fixed on it the head he had removed from the
broken one all that night don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady
dulcinea in order to conform to what he had read in his books how many
a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless
supported by the memory of their mistresses not so did sancho panza
spend it for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory
water he made but one sleep of it and if his master had not called him
neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes
of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken
him on getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than
the night before which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be
on the way to remedy the deficiency readily don quixote did not care to
break his fast for as has been already said he confined himself to
they returned to the road they had set out with leading to puerto
lapice and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it here
brother sancho panza said don quixote when he saw it we may plunge
our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures but observe
even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world thou must
not put a hand to thy sword in my defence unless indeed thou perceivest
that those who assail me are rabble or base folk for in that case thou
mayest very properly aid me but if they be knights it is on no account
permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou
most certainly senor replied sancho your worship shall be fully
obeyed in this matter all the more as of myself i am peaceful and no
friend to mixing in strife and quarrels it is true that as regards the
defence of my own person i shall not give much heed to those laws for
laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any
that i grant said don quixote but in this matter of aiding me
against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity
i will do so i promise you answered sancho and will keep this
while they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the
order of st benedict mounted on two dromedaries for not less tall were
the two mules they rode on they wore travelling spectacles and carried
sunshades and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons
on horseback and two muleteers on foot in the coach there was as
afterwards appeared a biscay lady on her way to seville where her
husband was about to take passage for the indies with an appointment of
high honour the friars though going the same road were not in her
company but the moment don quixote perceived them he said to his squire
either i am mistaken or this is going to be the most famous adventure
that has ever been seen for those black bodies we see there must be and
doubtless are magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in
that coach and with all my might i must undo this wrong
this will be worse than the windmills said sancho look senor those
are friars of st benedict and the coach plainly belongs to some
travellers i tell you to mind well what you are about and dont let the
i have told thee already sancho replied don quixote that on the
subject of adventures thou knowest little what i say is the truth as
so saying he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along
which the friars were coming and as soon as he thought they had come
near enough to hear what he said he cried aloud devilish and unnatural
beings release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying
off by force in this coach else prepare to meet a speedy death as the
the friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of don quixote
as well as at his words to which they replied senor caballero we are
not devilish or unnatural but two brothers of st benedict following our
road nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses
no soft words with me for i know you lying rabble said don quixote
and without waiting for a reply he spurred rocinante and with levelled
lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination that if
the friar had not flung himself off the mule he would have brought him
to the ground against his will and sore wounded if not killed outright
the second brother seeing how his comrade was treated drove his heels
into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the
sancho panza when he saw the friar on the ground dismounting briskly
from his ass rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown at that
instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him
for sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the
battle which his lord don quixote had won the muleteers who had no idea
of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils
seeing that don quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers
in the coach fell upon sancho knocked him down and leaving hardly a
hair in his beard belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched
breathless and senseless on the ground and without any more delay helped
the friar to mount who trembling terrified and pale as soon as he
found himself in the saddle spurred after his companion who was
standing at a distance looking on watching the result of the onslaught
then not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun they
pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil
don quixote was as has been said speaking to the lady in the coach
your beauty lady mine said he may now dispose of your person as may
be most in accordance with your pleasure for the pride of your ravishers
lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine and lest
you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer know that i am
called don quixote of la mancha knight errant and adventurer and
captive to the peerless and beautiful lady dulcinea del toboso and in
return for the service you have received of me i ask no more than that
you should return to el toboso and on my behalf present yourself before
that lady and tell her what i have done to set you free
one of the squires in attendance upon the coach a biscayan was
listening to all don quixote was saying and perceiving that he would
not allow the coach to go on but was saying it must return at once to el
toboso he made at him and seizing his lance addressed him in bad
castilian and worse biscayan after his fashion begone caballero and
ill go with thee by the god that made me unless thou quittest coach
don quixote understood him quite well and answered him very quietly if
thou wert a knight as thou art none i should have already chastised thy
folly and rashness miserable creature to which the biscayan returned
i no gentleman i swear to god thou liest as i am christian if thou
droppest lance and drawest sword soon shalt thou see thou art carrying
water to the cat biscayan on land hidalgo at sea hidalgo at the devil
and look if thou sayest otherwise thou liest
you will see presently said agrajes replied don quixote and
throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword braced his buckler on
his arm and attacked the biscayan bent upon taking his life
the biscayan when he saw him coming on though he wished to dismount
from his mule in which being one of those sorry ones let out for hire
he had no confidence had no choice but to draw his sword it was lucky
for him however that he was near the coach from which he was able to
snatch a cushion that served him for a shield and they went at one
another as if they had been two mortal enemies the others strove to make
peace between them but could not for the biscayan declared in his
disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would
kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him the lady in
the coach amazed and terrified at what she saw ordered the coachman to
draw aside a little and set herself to watch this severe struggle in
the course of which the biscayan smote don quixote a mighty stroke on the
shoulder over the top of his buckler which given to one without armour
would have cleft him to the waist don quixote feeling the weight of
this prodigious blow cried aloud saying o lady of my soul dulcinea
flower of beauty come to the aid of this your knight who in fulfilling
his obligations to your beauty finds himself in this extreme peril to
say this to lift his sword to shelter himself well behind his buckler
