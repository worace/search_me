because  said jondrette and he left the phrase unfinished
marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel
by the way said jondrette have you been eating here
yes said the mother i got three large potatoes and some salt i
took advantage of the fire to cook them
good returned jondrette to morrow i will take you out to dine with
me we will have a duck and fixings you shall dine like charles the
the mouse trap is open the cats are there
he lowered his voice still further and said
marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some
have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak
nearly six the half hour struck from saint medard a while ago
the devil ejaculated jondrette the children must go and watch come
are you sure that there is no one in our neighbors room
he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his
all the same said jondrette theres no harm in going to see whether
he is there here my girl take the candle and go there
marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed
hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the
ppa cried a voice he is not in here
he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter
no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out
the door opened and marius saw the tall jondrette come in with a candle
in her hand she was as she had been in the morning only still more
she walked straight up to the bed marius endured an indescribable
moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the
wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps she raised
herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it in the neighboring room
the sound of iron articles being moved was audible
she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand and smiled into the
mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice
mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts
sadorer huit jours c etait bien la peine
in the meantime marius trembled it seemed impossible to him that she
she stepped to the window and looked out with the half foolish way she
how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise said she
she returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it
scrutinizing herself full face and three quarters face in turn
well cried her father what are you about there
i am looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing
to arrange her hair theres no one here
booby yelled her father come here this minute and dont waste any
coming coming said she one has no time for anything in this
vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire29
she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door
a moment more and marius heard the sound of the two young girls bare
feet in the corridor and jondrettes voice shouting to them
pay strict heed one on the side of the barrier the other at the
corner of the rue du petit banquier dont lose sight for a moment of
the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on
the instant as hard as you can go you have a key to get in
the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot
to morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots said the
they ran down stairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer
door as it banged to announced that they were outside
there now remained in the house only marius the jondrettes and
probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a
glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic
chapter xvii the use made of marius five franc piece
marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his
post at his observatory in a twinkling and with the agility of his
age he had reached the hole in the partition
the interior of the jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect and
marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed
a candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but
that was not what really lighted the chamber the hovel was completely
illuminated as it were by the reflection from a rather large
sheet iron brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning
charcoal the brazier prepared by the jondrette woman that morning the
charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red a blue flame flickered
over it and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by
jondrette in the rue pierre lombard where it had been thrust into the
brazier to heat in one corner near the door and as though prepared
for some definite use two heaps were visible which appeared to be the
one a heap of old iron the other a heap of ropes all this would have
caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation
to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea the lair thus
lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell but jondrette
in this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith
the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was
melting on the side next the chafing dish and was drooping over an old
dark lantern of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouche stood on
the brazier placed in the fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct
brands sent its vapors up the chimney and gave out no odor
the moon entering through the four panes of the window cast its
whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetic spirit
of marius who was dreamy even in the moment of action it was like a
thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth
a breath of air which made its way in through the open pane helped to
dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the
the jondrette lair was if the reader recalls what we have said of the
gorbeau building admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent
and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime it was the most
retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted
boulevard in paris if the system of ambush and traps had not already
the whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms
separated this den from the boulevard and the only window that existed
opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades
jondrette had lighted his pipe seated himself on the seatless chair
and was engaged in smoking his wife was talking to him in a low tone
if marius had been courfeyrac that is to say one of those men who
laugh on every occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when
his gaze fell on the jondrette woman she had on a black bonnet with
plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds at arms at the coronation of
charles x an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat and the
mans shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning it was this
toilette which had extracted from jondrette the exclamation good you
have dressed up you have done well you must inspire confidence
as for jondrette he had not taken off the new surtout which was too
large for him and which m leblanc had given him and his costume
continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which
constituted the ideal of a poet in courfeyracs eyes
all at once jondrette lifted up his voice
by the way now that i think of it in this weather he will come in a
carriage light the lantern take it and go down stairs you will stand
behind the lower door the very moment that you hear the carriage stop
you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the
staircase and the corridor and when he enters here you will go down
stairs again as speedily as possible you will pay the coachman and
jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs
that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning
do you know what two chairs will be needed here
marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild
pardieu ill go and get one of our neighbors
and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the den and went out
marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach
no said she it would embarrass me i have the two chairs to carry
marius heard mother jondrettes heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the
dark the door opened he remained nailed to the spot with the shock and
the dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between
two blocks of shadow one of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the
wall against which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it
mother jondrette raised her eyes did not see marius took the two
chairs the only ones which marius possessed and went away letting the
and here is the lantern go down as quick as you can
she hastily obeyed and jondrette was left alone
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table turned the
chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which
masked the chafing dish then went to the corner where lay the pile
of rope and bent down as though to examine something marius then
recognized the fact that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a
very well made rope ladder with wooden rungs and two hooks with which
this ladder and some large tools veritable masses of iron which were
mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door had not been in the
jondrette hovel in the morning and had evidently been brought thither
those are the utensils of an edge tool maker thought marius
had marius been a little more learned in this line he would have
recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge tool maker
certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock and others
which will cut or slice the two families of tools which burglars call
the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius the
brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished
by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the
chimney piece cast a large shadow there was something indescribably
calm threatening and hideous about this chamber one felt that there
existed in it the anticipation of something terrible
jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out a serious sign of
preoccupation and had again seated himself the candle brought out the
fierce and the fine angles of his countenance he indulged in scowls and
in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand as though he were responding to
the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue in the course of one of
these dark replies which he was making to himself he pulled the table
drawer rapidly towards him took out a long kitchen knife which was
concealed there and tried the edge of its blade on his nail that done
he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it
marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out
the pistol emitted a sharp clear click as he cocked it
jondrette started half rose listened a moment then began to laugh and
what a fool i am its the partition cracking
chapter xviii marius two chairs form a vis a vis
suddenly the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the
panes six oclock was striking from saint medard
jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head when the sixth
had struck he snuffed the candle with his fingers
then he began to pace up and down the room listened at the corridor
provided only that he comes he muttered then he returned to his
he had hardly reseated himself when the door opened
mother jondrette had opened it and now remained in the corridor making
a horrible amiable grimace which one of the holes of the dark lantern
he wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable
monsieur fabantou said he this is for your rent and your most
pressing necessities we will attend to the rest hereafter
may god requite it to you my generous benefactor said jondrette
she slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering
m leblanc a chair an instant later she returned and whispered in his
the snow which had not ceased falling since the morning was so deep
that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible and they did not
jondrette had taken possession of the other chair facing m leblanc
now in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow let the
reader picture to himself in his own mind a cold night the solitudes
of the salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding sheets in
the moonlight the taper like lights of the street lanterns which shone
redly here and there along those tragic boulevards and the long rows
of black elms not a passer by for perhaps a quarter of a league around
the gorbeau hovel at its highest pitch of silence of horror and of
darkness in that building in the midst of those solitudes in the
midst of that darkness the vast jondrette garret lighted by a single
candle and in that den two men seated at a table m leblanc tranquil
jondrette smiling and alarming the jondrette woman the female wolf
in one corner and behind the partition marius invisible erect not
losing a word not missing a single movement his eye on the watch and
however marius experienced only an emotion of horror but no fear he
clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured i shall be
able to stop that wretch whenever i please he thought
he felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade waiting for
the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm
moreover he was in hopes that this violent encounter between jondrette
and m leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was
chapter xix occupying ones self with obscure depths
hardly was m leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the
how is the poor little wounded girl he inquired
bad replied jondrette with a heart broken and grateful smile very
bad my worthy sir her elder sister has taken her to the bourbe to
have her hurt dressed you will see them presently they will be back
madame fabantou seems to me to be better went on m leblanc casting
his eyes on the eccentric costume of the jondrette woman as she stood
between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed
at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat
she is dying said jondrette but what do you expect sir she has so
much courage that woman has shes not a woman shes an ox
the jondrette touched by his compliment deprecated it with the
you are always too good to me monsieur jondrette
jondrette said m leblanc i thought your name was fabantou
fabantou alias jondrette replied the husband hurriedly an artistic
and launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which m leblanc did
not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of
ah we have had a happy life together this poor darling and i what
would there be left for us if we had not that we are so wretched my
respectable sir we have arms but there is no work we have the will
no work i dont know how the government arranges that but on my word
of honor sir i am not jacobin sir i am not a bousingot30 i dont
wish them any evil but if i were the ministers on my most sacred word
things would be different here for instance i wanted to have my
girls taught the trade of paper box makers you will say to me what
a trade yes a trade a simple trade a bread winner what a fall
my benefactor what a degradation when one has been what we have been
alas there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity one thing
only a picture of which i think a great deal but which i am willing
to part with for i must live item one must live
while jondrette thus talked with an apparent incoherence which
detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his
physiognomy marius raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of
the room a person whom he had not seen before a man had just entered
so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges this
man wore a violet knitted vest which was old worn spotted cut and
gaping at every fold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on
his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his
face smeared with black he had seated himself in silence on the nearest
bed and as he was behind jondrette he could only be indistinctly
that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m
leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius he could not
refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jondrette
ah i see exclaimed jondrette buttoning up his coat with an air of
complaisance you are looking at your overcoat it fits me my faith
him ejaculated jondrette hes a neighbor of mine dont pay any
the neighbor was a singular looking individual however manufactories
of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint marceau many of the
workmen might have black faces besides this m leblancs whole person
excuse me what were you saying m fabantou
i was telling you sir and dear protector replied jondrette placing
his elbows on the table and contemplating m leblanc with steady and
tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the boa constrictor i was telling
you that i have a picture to sell
a slight sound came from the door a second man had just entered and
like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or
although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been
able to prevent m leblanc catching sight of him
dont mind them said jondrette they are people who belong in the
house so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable
picture but stop sir take a look at it
he rose went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we
have already mentioned and turned it round still leaving it supported
against the wall it really was something which resembled a picture and
which the candle illuminated somewhat marius could make nothing out of
it as jondrette stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse
daub and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity
a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor i am
as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs
to me but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so
either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness
m leblancs glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined
there were now four men three seated on the bed one standing near the
door post all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared
with black one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with
closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep he
was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a
horrible effect the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the
other wore his hair long none of them had on shoes those who did not
jondrette noticed that m leblancs eye was fixed on these men
they are friends they are neighbors said he their faces are black
because they work in charcoal they are chimney builders dont trouble
yourself about them my benefactor but buy my picture have pity on
my misery i will not ask you much for it how much do you think it is
well said m leblanc looking jondrette full in the eye and with the
manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern
have you your pocket book with you i should be satisfied with a
m leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid
glance around the room he had jondrette on his left on the side next
the window and the jondrette woman and the four men on his right on
the side next the door the four men did not stir and did not even seem
jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague
an eye and so lamentable an intonation that m leblanc might have
supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad
if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jondrette i
shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but
to throw myself into the river when i think that i wanted to have my
two girls taught the middle class paper box trade the making of boxes
for new years gifts well a table with a board at the end to keep the
glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a
pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of
the paste according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a
paring knife to cut the cardboard a mould to adjust it a hammer to
nail the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all and all that
in order to earn four sous a day and you have to work fourteen hours a
day and each box passes through the workwomans hands thirteen times
and you cant wet the paper and you mustnt spot anything and you must
keep the paste hot the devil i tell you four sous a day how do you
as he spoke jondrette did not look at m leblanc who was observing
him m leblancs eye was fixed on jondrette and jondrettes eye was
fixed on the door marius eager attention was transferred from one
to the other m leblanc seemed to be asking himself is this man an
idiot jondrette repeated two or three distinct times with all manner
of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order there
is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river i went down
three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for
all at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little
man drew himself up and became terrible took a step toward m leblanc
and cried in a voice of thunder that has nothing to do with the
the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of
three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black
paper the first was thin and had a long iron tipped cudgel the
second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the
handle with the blade downward a butchers pole axe for slaughtering
cattle the third a man with thick set shoulders not so slender as
the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some
it appeared that the arrival of these men was what jondrette had been
waiting for a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the
the young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl
m leblanc was very pale he was scrutinizing everything around him in
the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his
head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved
on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there
was nothing in his air which resembled fear he had improvised
an intrenchment out of the table and the man who but an instant
previously had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had
suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the
back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture
this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a
danger seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous
as they are kind both easily and simply the father of a woman whom we
love is never a stranger to us marius felt proud of that unknown man
three of the men of whom jondrette had said they are
chimney builders had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one
with a heavy pair of shears the second with weighing tongs the third
with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without
uttering a syllable the old man had remained on the bed and had merely
opened his eyes the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him
marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention
would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the
direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol
jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel
turned once more to m leblanc and repeated his question accompanying
it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to
m leblanc looked him full in the face and replied
then jondrette advanced to the table he leaned across the candle
crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m
leblancs calm face and advancing as far as possible without forcing m
leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to
my name is not fabantou my name is not jondrette my name is
thenardier i am the inn keeper of montfermeil do you understand
an almost imperceptible flush crossed m leblancs brow and he replied
with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level
marius did not hear this reply any one who had seen him at that moment
through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard
stupid thunder struck at the moment when jondrette said my name is
thenardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against
the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart
then his right arm all ready to discharge the signal shot dropped
slowly and at the moment when jondrette repeated thenardier do you
understand mariuss faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol
fall jondrette by revealing his identity had not moved m leblanc
but he had quite upset marius that name of thenardier with which m
leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well let the reader
recall what that name meant to him that name he had worn on his heart
inscribed in his fathers testament he bore it at the bottom of his
mind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction a certain
thenardier saved my life if my son encounters him he will do him all
the good that lies in his power that name it will be remembered
was one of the pieties of his soul he mingled it with the name of
his father in his worship what this man was that thenardier that
inn keeper of montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought he
had found him at last and how his fathers saviour was a ruffian
that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was
a monster that liberator of colonel pontmercy was on the point
of committing a crime whose scope marius did not as yet clearly
comprehend but which resembled an assassination and against whom
great god what a fatality what a bitter mockery of fate his father
had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in
his power to this thenardier and for four years marius had cherished
no other thought than to acquit this debt of his fathers and at the
moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very
act of crime by justice destiny cried to him this is thenardier
he could at last repay this man for his fathers life saved amid a
hail storm of grape shot on the heroic field of waterloo and repay it
with the scaffold he had sworn to himself that if ever he found that
thenardier he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet
and now he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over
to the executioner his father said to him succor thenardier and he
replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing thenardier he was
about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who
had torn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the
place saint jacques through the means of his son of that marius to whom
he had entrusted that man by his will and what a mockery to have so
long worn on his breast his fathers last commands written in his own
hand only to act in so horribly contrary a sense but on the other
hand now look on that trap and not prevent it condemn the victim and
to spare the assassin could one be held to any gratitude towards so
miserable a wretch all the ideas which marius had cherished for the
last four years were pierced through and through as it were by this
he shuddered everything depended on him unknown to themselves he
held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his
eyes if he fired his pistol m leblanc was saved and thenardier lost
if he did not fire m leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows
thenardier would escape should he dash down the one or allow the other
to fall remorse awaited him in either case
what was he to do what should he choose be false to the most imperious
souvenirs to all those solemn vows to himself to the most sacred duty
to the most venerated text should he ignore his fathers testament
or allow the perpetration of a crime on the one hand it seemed to him
that he heard his ursule supplicating for her father and on the other
the colonel commending thenardier to his care he felt that he was going
mad his knees gave way beneath him and he had not even the time for
deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes
was hastening to its catastrophe it was like a whirlwind of which he
had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away he
in the meantime thenardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other
name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy
he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the chimney piece with
so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and the
then he turned to m leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these
and again he began to march back and forth in full eruption
ah he cried so ive found you again at last mister philanthropist
mister threadbare millionnaire mister giver of dolls you old
ninny ah so you dont recognize me no it wasnt you who came to
montfermeil to my inn eight years ago on christmas eve 1823 it
wasnt you who carried off that fantines child from me the lark it
wasnt you who had a yellow great coat no nor a package of duds in
your hand as you had this morning here say wife it seems to be his
mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses old charity
monger get out with you are you a hosier mister millionnaire you
give away your stock in trade to the poor holy man what bosh merry
andrew ah and you dont recognize me well i recognize you that i
do i recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here ah
youll find out presently that it isnt all roses to thrust yourself
in that fashion into peoples houses under the pretext that they are
taverns in wretched clothes with the air of a poor man to whom one
would give a sou to deceive persons to play the generous to take away
their means of livelihood and to make threats in the woods and you
cant call things quits because afterwards when people are ruined you
bring a coat that is too large and two miserable hospital blankets you
he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment one would
have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone
then as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been
saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and
parbleu you made game of me in the past you are the cause of all my
misfortunes for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and
who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a
great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live
on all my life a girl who would have made up to me for everything that
i lost in that vile cook shop where there was nothing but one continual
row and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing oh i wish all
the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it
well never mind say now you must have thought me ridiculous when you
went off with the lark you had your cudgel in the forest you were the
stronger revenge im the one to hold the trumps to day youre in a
sorry case my good fellow oh but i can laugh really i laugh didnt
he fall into the trap i told him that i was an actor that my name was
fabantou that i had played comedy with mamselle mars with mamselle
muche that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow the 4th of
february and he didnt even notice that the 8th of january and not the
4th of february is the time when the quarter runs out absurd idiot
and the four miserable philippes which he has brought me scoundrel
he hadnt the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs and how
he swallowed my platitudes that did amuse me i said to myself
blockhead come ive got you i lick your paws this morning but ill
thenardier paused he was out of breath his little narrow chest panted
like a forge bellows his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a
feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last
harass what it has feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of
a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the
joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull so nearly dead
that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer
m leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused
i do not know what you mean to say you are mistaken in me i am a very
poor man and anything but a millionnaire i do not know you you are
ah roared thenardier hoarsely a pretty lie you stick to that
pleasantry do you youre floundering my old buck ah you dont
excuse me sir said m leblanc with a politeness of accent which at
that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are
who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a
susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish at this word
villain the female thenardier sprang from the bed thenardier grasped
his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands dont you
stir he shouted to his wife and turning to m leblanc
villain yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen stop
its true that i became bankrupt that i am in hiding that i have no
bread that i have not a single sou that i am a villain its three
days since i have had anything to eat so im a villain ah you folks
warm your feet you have sakoski boots you have wadded great coats
like archbishops you lodge on the first floor in houses that have
porters you eat truffles you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch
in the month of january and green peas you gorge yourselves and when
you want to know whether it is cold you look in the papers to see what
the engineer chevaliers thermometer says about it we it is we who are
thermometers we dont need to go out and look on the quay at the corner
of the tour de lhorologe to find out the number of degrees of cold
we feel our blood congealing in our veins and the ice forming round our
hearts and we say there is no god and you come to our caverns yes
our caverns for the purpose of calling us villains but well devour
you but well devour you poor little things just see here mister
millionnaire i have been a solid man i have held a license i have
been an elector i am a bourgeois that i am and its quite possible
here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door and
when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a
then addressing m leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy

marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was
listening the last possibility of doubt had just vanished it certainly
was the thenardier of the will marius shuddered at that reproach of
ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point
of so fatally justifying his perplexity was redoubled
moreover there was in all these words of thenardier in his accent in
his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there
was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that
mixture of braggadocio and abjectness of pride and pettiness of rage
and folly in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments in
that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights
of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that
conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds something
which was as hideous as evil and as heart rending as the truth
the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed
that m leblanc should purchase was nothing else as the reader has
divined than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered
by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at

when thenardier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes
on m leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice
what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you
in the midst of this silence a cracked voice launched this lugubrious
if theres any wood to be split im there
it was the man with the axe who was growing merry
at the same moment an enormous bristling and clayey face made its
appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth
it was the face of the man with the butchers axe
why have you taken off your mask cried thenardier in a rage
for the last few minutes m leblanc had appeared to be watching and
following all the movements of thenardier who blinded and dazzled by
his own rage was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence
that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed man fast he being
armed himself of being nine against one supposing that the female
during his address to the man with the pole axe he had turned his back
m leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and
the table with his fist and with one bound with prodigious agility
before thenardier had time to turn round he had reached the window to
open it to scale the frame to bestride it was the work of a second
