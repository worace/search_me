i dont understand what you say or mean by slipping said don quixote
i will explain myself another time said don lorenzo for the present
pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss which run thus
then would i ask no more than this
or could for me the time that is
but all things change she changed her mind
for trust me i would ask no more
then would i ask no more than this
no power on earth can bring to pass
for fleet of foot is he i wis
that what for aye hath left us may
twixt hope and fear is death not life
and yet thought were the best for me
and dread the time that is to be
when don lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss don quixote stood up
and in a loud voice almost a shout exclaimed as he grasped don
lorenzos right hand in his by the highest heavens noble youth but
you are the best poet on earth and deserve to be crowned with laurel
not by cyprus or by gaeta as a certain poet god forgive him said but
by the academies of athens if they still flourished and by those that
flourish now paris bologna salamanca heaven grant that the judges who
rob you of the first prize that phoebus may pierce them with his arrows
and the muses never cross the thresholds of their doors repeat me some
of your long measure verses senor if you will be so good for i want
thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius
is there any need to say that don lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised
by don quixote albeit he looked upon him as a madman power of flattery
how far reaching art thou and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant
jurisdiction don lorenzo gave a proof of it for he complied with don
quixotes request and entreaty and repeated to him this sonnet on the
the lovely maid she pierces now the wall
heart pierced by her young pyramus doth lie
and love spreads wing from cyprus isle to fly
a chink to view so wondrous great and small
there silence speaketh for no voice at all
can pass so strait a strait but love will ply
where to all other power twere vain to try
for love will find a way whateer befall
the rash maid wins the fatal spot where she
sinks not in lovers arms but deaths embrace
so runs the strange tale how the lovers twain
slays and entombs and brings to life again
blessed be god said don quixote when he had heard don lorenzos
sonnet that among the hosts there are of irritable poets i have found
one consummate one which senor the art of this sonnet proves to me
for four days was don quixote most sumptuously entertained in don diegos
house at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart
telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had
received in his house but that as it did not become knights errant to
give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury he was anxious to
fulfill the duties of his calling in seeking adventures of which he was
informed there was an abundance in that neighbourhood where he hoped to
employ his time until the day came round for the jousts at saragossa for
that was his proper destination and that first of all he meant to
enter the cave of montesinos of which so many marvellous things were
reported all through the country and at the same time to investigate and
explore the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the
don diego and his son commended his laudable resolution and bade him
furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings as
they would most gladly be of service to him which indeed his personal
worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them
the day of his departure came at length as welcome to don quixote as it
was sad and sorrowful to sancho panza who was very well satisfied with
the abundance of don diegos house and objected to return to the
starvation of the woods and wilds and the short commons of his
ill stocked alforjas these however he filled and packed with what he
considered needful on taking leave don quixote said to don lorenzo i
know not whether i have told you already but if i have i tell you once
more that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the
inaccessible summit of the temple of fame you have nothing to do but to
turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still
narrower one of knight errantry wide enough however to make you an
in this speech don quixote wound up the evidence of his madness but
still better in what he added when he said god knows i would gladly
take don lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble and
trample the proud under foot virtues that are part and parcel of the
profession i belong to but since his tender age does not allow of it
nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it i will simply content myself
with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a
poet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own
because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill favoured
and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of
both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley don quixote
talked at one moment sense at another nonsense and at the pertinacity
and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of
his unlucky adventures which he made the end and aim of his desires
there was a renewal of offers of service and civilities and then with
the gracious permission of the lady of the castle they took their
departure don quixote on rocinante and sancho on dapple
in which is related the adventure of the enamoured shepherd together
don quixote had gone but a short distance beyond don diegos village
when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students and a couple
of peasants mounted on four beasts of the ass kind one of the students
carried wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau
what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of ribbed
stockings the other carried nothing but a pair of new fencing foils with
buttons the peasants carried divers articles that showed they were on
their way from some large town where they had bought them and were
taking them home to their village and both students and peasants were
struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw don quixote
for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different
from ordinary men could be don quixote saluted them and after
ascertaining that their road was the same as his made them an offer of
his company and begged them to slacken their pace as their young asses
travelled faster than his horse and then to gratify them he told them
in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed
which was that of a knight errant seeking adventures in all parts of the
world he informed them that his own name was don quixote of la mancha
and that he was called by way of surname the knight of the lions
all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants but not so to the
students who very soon perceived the crack in don quixotes pate for
all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and one
of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is
the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship
come with us you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up
to this day have ever been celebrated in la mancha or for many a league
don quixote asked him if it was some princes that he spoke of it in
this way not at all said the student it is the wedding of a farmer
and a farmers daughter he the richest in all this country and she the
fairest mortal ever set eyes on the display with which it is to be
attended will be something rare and out of the common for it will be
celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride who is called
par excellence quiteria the fair as the bridegroom is called camacho
the rich she is eighteen and he twenty two and they are fairly
matched though some knowing ones who have all the pedigrees in the
world by heart will have it that the family of the fair quiteria is
better than camachos but no one minds that now a days for wealth can
solder a great many flaws at any rate camacho is free handed and it is
his fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in
overhead so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to
reach the grass that covers the soil he has provided dancers too not
only sword but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who
ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of shoe dancers i
say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
nor of the many others i have omitted to mention will do more to make
this a memorable wedding than the part which i suspect the despairing
basilio will play in it this basilio is a youth of the same village as
quiteria and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents of
which circumstance love took advantage to reproduce to the word the
long forgotten loves of pyramus and thisbe for basilio loved quiteria
from his earliest years and she responded to his passion with countless
modest proofs of affection so that the loves of the two children
basilio and quiteria were the talk and the amusement of the town as
they grew up the father of quiteria made up his mind to refuse basilio
his wonted freedom of access to the house and to relieve himself of
constant doubts and suspicions he arranged a match for his daughter with
the rich camacho as he did not approve of marrying her to basilio who
had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the
truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty
thrower of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he
runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat bowls over the nine pins
as if by magic sings like a lark plays the guitar so as to make it
speak and above all handles a sword as well as the best
for that excellence alone said don quixote at this the youth
deserves to marry not merely the fair quiteria but queen guinevere
herself were she alive now in spite of launcelot and all who would try
say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in
silence for she wont hear of anything but each one marrying his equal
holding with the proverb each ewe to her like what i would like is
that this good basilio for i am beginning to take a fancy to him
already should marry this lady quiteria and a blessing and good luck i
meant to say the opposite on people who would prevent those who love one
if all those who love one another were to marry said don quixote it
would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to
the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters
to choose husbands as they pleased one would be for choosing her
fathers servant and another some one she has seen passing in the
street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully
for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment so much wanted
in choosing ones way of life and the matrimonial choice is very liable
to error and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to
make it a good one he who has to make a long journey will if he is
wise look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him
before he sets out why then should not he do the same who has to make
the whole journey of life down to the final halting place of death more
especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed at board
and everywhere as the wife is to her husband the companionship of ones
wife is no article of merchandise that after it has been bought may be
returned or bartered or changed for it is an inseparable accident that
lasts as long as life lasts it is a noose that once you put it round
your neck turns into a gordian knot which if the scythe of death does
not cut it there is no untying i could say a great deal more on this
subject were i not prevented by the anxiety i feel to know if the senor
licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of basilio
to this the student bachelor or as don quixote called him licentiate
replied i have nothing whatever to say further but that from the
moment basilio learned that the fair quiteria was to be married to
camacho the rich he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter
rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to
himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses he eats
little and sleeps little and all he eats is fruit and when he sleeps
if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute
beast sometimes he gazes at the sky at other times he fixes his eyes on
the earth in such an abstracted way that he might be taken for a clothed
statue with its drapery stirred by the wind in short he shows such
signs of a heart crushed by suffering that all we who know him believe
that when to morrow the fair quiteria says yes it will be his sentence
god will guide it better said sancho for god who gives the wound
gives the salve nobody knows what will happen there are a good many
hours between this and to morrow and any one of them or any moment the
house may fall i have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all
at one time many a one goes to bed in good health who cant stir the
next day and tell me is there anyone who can boast of having driven a
nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a womans yes
and no i wouldnt venture to put the point of a pin for there would
not be room for it if you tell me quiteria loves basilio heart and soul
then ill give him a bag of good luck for love i have heard say looks
through spectacles that make copper seem gold poverty wealth and blear
what art thou driving at sancho curses on thee said don quixote
for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together no one
can understand thee but judas himself and i wish he had thee tell me
thou animal what dost thou know about nails or wheels or anything
oh if you dont understand me replied sancho it is no wonder my
words are taken for nonsense but no matter i understand myself and i
know i have not said anything very foolish in what i have said only your
worship senor is always gravelling at everything i say nay everything
cavilling not gravelling said don quixote thou prevaricator of
dont find fault with me your worship returned sancho for you know
i have not been bred up at court or trained at salamanca to know whether
i am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words why god bless me
its not fair to force a sayago man to speak like a toledan maybe there
are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk
that is true said the licentiate for those who have been bred up in
the tanneries and the zocodover cannot talk like those who are almost all
day pacing the cathedral cloisters and yet they are all toledans pure
correct elegant and lucid language will be met with in men of courtly
breeding and discrimination though they may have been born in
majalahonda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not
so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be
accompanied by practice i sirs for my sins have studied canon law at
salamanca and i rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear
if you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foils
you carry than on dexterity of tongue said the other student you
would have been head of the degrees where you are now tail
look here bachelor corchuelo returned the licentiate you have the
most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you think
it is no idea on my part but an established truth replied corchuelo
and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment you have swords
there and it is a good opportunity i have a steady hand and a strong
arm and these joined with my resolution which is not small will make
you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put in practice your
positions and circles and angles and science for i hope to make you see
stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship in which next to god i
place my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turn my
back and that there is not one in the world i will not compel to give
as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself
replied the master of fence though it might be that your grave would be
dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time i mean that
you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword
we shall soon see replied corchuelo and getting off his ass briskly
he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his
it must not be that way said don quixote at this point i will be the
director of this fencing match and judge of this often disputed
question and dismounting from rocinante and grasping his lance he
planted himself in the middle of the road just as the licentiate with
an easy graceful bearing and step advanced towards corchuelo who came
on against him darting fire from his eyes as the saying is the other
two of the company the peasants without dismounting from their asses
served as spectators of the mortal tragedy the cuts thrusts down
strokes back strokes and doubles that corchuelo delivered were past
counting and came thicker than hops or hail he attacked like an angry
lion but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the
licentiates sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset
and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutly as
relics are and ought to be kissed the end of it was that the licentiate
reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short
cassock he wore tore the skirts into strips like the tails of a
cuttlefish knocked off his hat twice and so completely tired him out
that in vexation anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt and
flung it away with such force that one of the peasants that were there
who was a notary and who went for it made an affidavit afterwards that
he sent it nearly three quarters of a league which testimony will serve
and has served to show and establish with all certainty that strength is
corchuelo sat down wearied and sancho approaching him said by my
faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never
challenge anyone to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for
you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencers as
they call them i have heard say they can put the point of a sword
i am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey said corchuelo and
with having had the truth i was so ignorant of proved to me by
experience and getting up he embraced the licentiate and they were
better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had
gone for the sword as they saw he would be a long time about it they
resolved to push on so as to reach the village of quiteria to which they
during the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on
the excellences of the sword with such conclusive arguments and such
figures and mathematical proofs that all were convinced of the value of
the science and corchuelo cured of his dogmatism
it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as
if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it
they heard too the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments
flutes drums psalteries pipes tabors and timbrels and as they drew
near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had been
constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights
unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it
had not power to stir the leaves on the trees the musicians were the
life of the wedding wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate
bands some dancing others singing others playing the various
instruments already mentioned in short it seemed as though mirth and
gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow several other
persons were engaged in erecting raised benches from which people might
conveniently see the plays and dances that were to be performed the next
day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of camacho
the rich and the obsequies of basilio don quixote would not enter the
village although the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him he
excused himself however on the grounds amply sufficient in his
opinion that it was the custom of knights errant to sleep in the fields
and woods in preference to towns even were it under gilded ceilings and
so turned aside a little out of the road very much against sanchos
will as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don
wherein an account is given of the wedding of camacho the rich together
scarce had the fair aurora given bright phoebus time to dry the liquid
pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays when don
quixote shaking off sloth from his limbs sprang to his feet and called
to his squire sancho who was still snoring seeing which don quixote ere
he roused him thus addressed him happy thou above all the dwellers on
the face of the earth that without envying or being envied sleepest
with tranquil mind and that neither enchanters persecute nor
enchantments affright sleep i say and will say a hundred times
without any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless
vigils or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest or
find to morrows food for thyself and thy needy little family to
interfere with thy repose ambition breaks not thy rest nor doth this
worlds empty pomp disturb thee for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is
to provide for thy ass since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the
support of thyself the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom
have imposed upon masters the servant sleeps and the master lies awake
thinking how he is to feed him advance him and reward him the distress
of seeing the sky turn brazen and withhold its needful moisture from the
earth is not felt by the servant but by the master who in time of
scarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of
to all this sancho made no reply because he was asleep nor would he have
wakened up so soon as he did had not don quixote brought him to his
senses with the butt of his lance he awoke at last drowsy and lazy and
casting his eyes about in every direction observed there comes if i
dont mistake from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a
great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme a wedding
that begins with smells like that by my faith ought to be plentiful and
have done thou glutton said don quixote come let us go and witness
this bridal and see what the rejected basilio does
let him do what he likes returned sancho be he not poor he would
marry quiteria to make a grand match for himself and he without a
farthing is there nothing else faith senor its my opinion the poor
man should be content with what he can get and not go looking for
dainties in the bottom of the sea i will bet my arm that camacho could
bury basilio in reals and if that be so as no doubt it is what a fool
quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels camacho must have
given her and will give her and take basilios bar throwing and
sword play they wont give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good cast
of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword talents and accomplishments
that cant be turned into money let count dirlos have them but when
such gifts fall to one that has hard cash i wish my condition of life
was as becoming as they are on a good foundation you can raise a good
building and the best foundation in the world is money
for gods sake sancho said don quixote here stop that harangue it
is my belief if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest every
instant thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping for thou
if your worship had a good memory replied sancho you would remember
the articles of our agreement before we started from home this last time
one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked so long as it was
not against my neighbour or your worships authority and so far it
seems to me i have not broken the said article
i remember no such article sancho said don quixote and even if it
were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the
instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the
valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of
the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon
sancho did as his master bade him and putting the saddle on rocinante
and the pack saddle on dapple they both mounted and at a leisurely pace
entered the arcade the first thing that presented itself to sanchos
eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree and in the fire at which
it was to be roasted there was burning a middling sized mountain of
faggots and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in
the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each
fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house they swallowed up whole
sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of
them than if they were pigeons countless were the hares ready skinned
and the plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots
numberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from the
branches that the air might keep them cool sancho counted more than
sixty wine skins of over six gallons each and all filled as it proved
afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the
whitest bread like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing floors
there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick work and two
cauldrons full of oil bigger than those of a dyers shop served for
cooking fritters which when fried were taken out with two mighty
shovels and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood
close by of cooks and cook maids there were over fifty all clean
brisk and blithe in the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft
little sucking pigs which sewn up there served to give it tenderness
and flavour the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been
bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a
great chest in short all the preparations made for the wedding were in
rustic style but abundant enough to feed an army
sancho observed all contemplated all and everything won his heart the
first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots out of which he
would have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful then the
wine skins secured his affections and lastly the produce of the
frying pans if indeed such imposing cauldrons may be called
frying pans and unable to control himself or bear it any longer he
approached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged
permission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots to which the cook
made answer brother this is not a day on which hunger is to have any
sway thanks to the rich camacho get down and look about for a ladle and
skim off a hen or two and much good may they do you
wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular and
bashful you are and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into
one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese and said
to sancho fall to friend and take the edge off your appetite with
i have nothing to put them in said sancho
well then said the cook take spoon and all for camachos wealth and
while sancho fared thus don quixote was watching the entrance at one
end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala
dress mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field
trappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals who
marshalled in regular order ran not one but several courses over the
meadow with jubilant shouts and cries of long live camacho and
quiteria he as rich as she is fair and she the fairest on earth
hearing this don quixote said to himself it is easy to see these folk
have never seen my dulcinea del toboso for if they had they would be
more moderate in their praises of this quiteria of theirs
shortly after this several bands of dancers of various sorts began to
enter the arcade at different points and among them one of sword dancers
composed of some four and twenty lads of gallant and high spirited mien
clad in the finest and whitest of linen and with handkerchiefs
embroidered in various colours with fine silk and one of those on the
mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been
wounded as yet thank god no one has been wounded said he we are
all safe and sound and he at once began to execute complicated figures
with the rest of his comrades with so many turns and so great dexterity
that although don quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind
he thought he had never seen any so good as this he also admired another
that came in composed of fair young maidens none of whom seemed to be
under fourteen or over eighteen years of age all clad in green stuff
with their locks partly braided partly flowing loose but all of such
bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams and over them they wore garlands
of jessamine roses amaranth and honeysuckle at their head were a
venerable old man and an ancient dame more brisk and active however
than might have been expected from their years the notes of a zamora
bagpipe accompanied them and with modesty in their countenances and in
their eyes and lightness in their feet they looked the best dancers in
following these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call
speaking dances it was composed of eight nymphs in two files with the
god cupid leading one and interest the other the former furnished with
wings bow quiver and arrows the latter in a rich dress of gold and
silk of divers colours the nymphs that followed love bore their names
written on white parchment in large letters on their backs poetry was
the name of the first wit of the second birth of the third and
valour of the fourth those that followed interest were distinguished
in the same way the badge of the first announced liberality that of
the second largess the third treasure and the fourth peaceful
possession in front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four wild
men all clad in ivy and hemp stained green and looking so natural that
they nearly terrified sancho on the front of the castle and on each of
the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription castle of caution
four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them and the dance
having been opened cupid after executing two figures raised his eyes
and bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the
i know not fear i have my will
having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the
castle and went back to his place interest then came forward and went
through two more figures and as soon as the tabors ceased he said
though love it be that leads me on
interest retired and poetry came forward and when she had gone through
her figures like the others fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle
poetry withdrew and on the side of interest liberality advanced and
in the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and
retired and each executed its figures and delivered its verses some of
them graceful some burlesque but don quixotes memory though he had an
excellent one only carried away those that have been just quoted all
then mingled together forming chains and breaking off again with
graceful unconstrained gaiety and whenever love passed in front of the
castle he shot his arrows up at it while interest broke gilded pellets
against it at length after they had danced a good while interest drew
out a great purse made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all
appearance full of money and flung it at the castle and with the force
of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down leaving the damsel
exposed and unprotected interest and the characters of his band
advanced and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to
take her and lead her away captive on seeing which love and his
supporters made as though they would release her the whole action being
to the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance
the wild men made peace between them and with great dexterity readjusted
and fixed the boards of the castle and the damsel once more ensconced
herself within and with this the dance wound up to the great enjoyment
don quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and
arranged it she replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a
nice taste in devising things of the sort i will lay a wager said don
quixote that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of
camachos than of basilios and that he is better at satire than at
vespers he has introduced the accomplishments of basilio and the riches
of camacho very neatly into the dance sancho panza who was listening
to all this exclaimed the king is my cock i stick to camacho it is
easy to see thou art a clown sancho said don quixote and one of that
sort that cry long life to the conqueror
i dont know of what sort i am returned sancho but i know very well
ill never get such elegant skimmings off basilios pots as these i have
got off camachos and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens
and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite saying a
fig for the accomplishments of basilio as much as thou hast so much art
thou worth and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou as a
grandmother of mine used to say there are only two families in the
world the haves and the havents and she stuck to the haves and to
this day senor don quixote people would sooner feel the pulse of
have than of know an ass covered with gold looks better than a
horse with a pack saddle so once more i say i stick to camacho the
bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens hares and rabbits
but of basilios if any ever come to hand or even to foot theyll be
hast thou finished thy harangue sancho said don quixote of course i
have finished it replied sancho because i see your worship takes
offence at it but if it was not for that there was work enough cut out
god grant i may see thee dumb before i die sancho said don quixote
at the rate we are going said sancho ill be chewing clay before
your worship dies and then maybe ill be so dumb that ill not say a
word until the end of the world or at least till the day of judgment
even should that happen o sancho said don quixote thy silence will
never come up to all thou hast talked art talking and wilt talk all thy
life moreover it naturally stands to reason that my death will come
before thine so i never expect to see thee dumb not even when thou art
drinking or sleeping and that is the utmost i can say
in good faith senor replied sancho theres no trusting that
fleshless one i mean death who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep
and as i have heard our curate say treads with equal foot upon the
lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor that lady is more
mighty than dainty she is no way squeamish she devours all and is ready
for all and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts ages and
ranks she is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide at all times she is
reaping and cutting down as well the dry grass as the green she never
seems to chew but bolts and swallows all that is put before her for she
has a canine appetite that is never satisfied and though she has no
belly she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of
all that live as one would drink a jug of cold water
say no more sancho said don quixote at this dont try to better it
and risk a fall for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy
rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said i tell thee
sancho if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit thou mightst
take a pulpit in hand and go about the world preaching fine sermons
he preaches well who lives well said sancho and i know no more
nor needst thou said don quixote but i cannot conceive or make out
how it is that the fear of god being the beginning of wisdom thou who
art more afraid of a lizard than of him knowest so much
pass judgment on your chivalries senor returned sancho and dont
set yourself up to judge of other mens fears or braveries for i am as
good a fearer of god as my neighbours but leave me to despatch these
skimmings for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to
account for in the other world and so saying he began a fresh attack
on the bucket with such a hearty appetite that he aroused don quixotes
who no doubt would have helped him had he not been prevented by what must
in which camachos wedding is continued with other delightful incidents
while don quixote and sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the
last chapter they heard loud shouts and a great noise which were
uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop
shouting to receive the bride and bridegroom who were approaching with
musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them and
accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both and all the most
distinguished people of the surrounding villages when sancho saw the
bride he exclaimed by my faith she is not dressed like a country
girl but like some fine court lady egad as well as i can make out the
patena she wears rich coral and her green cuenca stuff is thirty pile
velvet and then the white linen trimming by my oath but its satin
look at her hands jet rings on them may i never have luck if theyre
not gold rings and real gold and set with pearls as white as a curdled
milk and every one of them worth an eye of ones head whoreson baggage
what hair she has if its not a wig i never saw longer or fairer all
the days of my life see how bravely she bears herself and her shape
wouldnt you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of
dates for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just
like them i swear in my heart she is a brave lass and fit to pass over
don quixote laughed at sanchos boorish eulogies and thought that saving
his lady dulcinea del toboso he had never seen a more beautiful woman
the fair quiteria appeared somewhat pale which was no doubt because of
the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their
wedding on the morrow they advanced towards a theatre that stood on one
side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs where they were to
plight their troth and from which they were to behold the dances and
plays but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud
outcry behind them and a voice exclaiming wait a little ye as
inconsiderate as ye are hasty at these words all turned round and
perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose
black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames he was crowned as
was presently seen with a crown of gloomy cypress and in his hand he
held a long staff as he approached he was recognised by everyone as the
gay basilio and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his
words in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at
such a moment he came up at last weary and breathless and planting
himself in front of the bridal pair drove his staff which had a steel
spike at the end into the ground and with a pale face and eyes fixed
on quiteria he thus addressed her in a hoarse trembling voice
well dost thou know ungrateful quiteria that according to the holy law
we acknowledge so long as live thou canst take no husband nor art thou
ignorant either that in my hopes that time and my own exertions would
improve my fortunes i have never failed to observe the respect due to
thy honour but thou casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love
wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring
him not only good fortune but supreme happiness and now to complete it
not that i think he deserves it but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to
bestow it upon him i will with my own hands do away with the obstacle
that may interfere with it and remove myself from between you long live
the rich camacho many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful
quiteria and let the poor basilio die basilio whose poverty clipped the
wings of his happiness and brought him to the grave
and so saying he seized the staff he had driven into the ground and
leaving one half of it fixed there showed it to be a sheath that
concealed a tolerably long rapier and what may be called its hilt being
planted in the ground he swiftly coolly and deliberately threw himself
upon it and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his
his friends at once ran to his aid filled with grief at his misery and
sad fate and don quixote dismounting from rocinante hastened to
support him and took him in his arms and found he had not yet ceased to
breathe they were about to draw out the rapier but the priest who was
standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him
as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death basilio
however reviving slightly said in a weak voice as though in pain if
thou wouldst consent cruel quiteria to give me thy hand as my bride in
this last fatal moment i might still hope that my rashness would find
pardon as by its means i attained the bliss of being thine
hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather
than of the cravings of the body and in all earnestness implore gods
pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve to which basilio replied
that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her
hand in marriage for that happiness would compose his mind and give him
don quixote hearing the wounded mans entreaty exclaimed aloud that what
basilio asked was just and reasonable and moreover a request that might
be easily complied with and that it would be as much to senor camachos
honour to receive the lady quiteria as the widow of the brave basilio as
if he received her direct from her father
in this case said he it will be only to say yes and no
consequences can follow the utterance of the word for the nuptial couch
camacho was listening to all this perplexed and bewildered and not
knowing what to say or do but so urgent were the entreaties of basilios
friends imploring him to allow quiteria to give him her hand so that
his soul quitting this life in despair should not be lost that they
moved nay forced him to say that if quiteria were willing to give it
he was satisfied as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his
wishes for a moment at once all assailed quiteria and pressed her some
with prayers and others with tears and others with persuasive
arguments to give her hand to poor basilio but she harder than marble
and more unmoved than any statue seemed unable or unwilling to utter a
word nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her
decide quickly what she meant to do as basilio now had his soul at his
teeth and there was no time for hesitation
on this the fair quiteria to all appearance distressed grieved and
repentant advanced without a word to where basilio lay his eyes already
turned in his head his breathing short and painful murmuring the name
of quiteria between his teeth and apparently about to die like a heathen
and not like a christian quiteria approached him and kneeling demanded
his hand by signs without speaking basilio opened his eyes and gazing
fixedly at her said o quiteria why hast thou turned compassionate at
a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life
for i have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou
givest me in accepting me as thine or to suppress the pain that is
rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes what i entreat of
thee o thou fatal star to me is that the hand thou demandest of me and
wouldst give me be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me
afresh but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint
upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband for it is
not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this or
have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee
while uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it then
quiteria overcome with modesty and shame holding in her right hand the
hand of basilio said no force would bend my will as freely
therefore as it is possible for me to do so i give thee the hand of a
lawful wife and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free
will untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought
yes i give it said basilio not agitated or distracted but with
unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me thus do i give
and i give myself to be thy wife said quiteria whether thou livest
many years or they carry thee from my arms to the grave
for one so badly wounded observed sancho at this point this young
man has a great deal to say they should make him leave off billing and
cooing and attend to his soul for to my thinking he has it more on his
basilio and quiteria having thus joined hands the priest deeply moved
and with tears in his eyes pronounced the blessing upon them and
implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded
man who the instant he received the blessing started nimbly to his
feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been
sheathed in his body all the bystanders were astounded and some more
simple than inquiring began shouting a miracle a miracle but
basilio replied no miracle no miracle only a trick a trick the
priest perplexed and amazed made haste to examine the wound with both
hands and found that the blade had passed not through basilios flesh
and ribs but through a hollow iron tube full of blood which he had
adroitly fixed at the place the blood as was afterwards ascertained
having been so prepared as not to congeal in short the priest and
camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools
of the bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception on the
contrary hearing them say that the marriage being fraudulent would not
be valid she said that she confirmed it afresh whence they all
concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding
between the pair whereat camacho and his supporters were so mortified
that they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence and a great number
of them drawing their swords attacked basilio in whose protection as
many more swords were in an instant unsheathed while don quixote taking
the lead on horseback with his lance over his arm and well covered with
his shield made all give way before him sancho who never found any
pleasure or enjoyment in such doings retreated to the wine jars from
which he had taken his delectable skimmings considering that as a holy
hold sirs hold cried don quixote in a loud voice we have no right
to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us remember love and
war are the same thing and as in war it is allowable and common to make
use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy so in the contests and
rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired
end are justifiable provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour
of the loved object quiteria belonged to basilio and basilio to quiteria
by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven camacho is rich and can
purchase his pleasure when where and as it pleases him basilio has but
this ewe lamb and no one however powerful he may be shall take her
from him these two whom god hath joined man cannot separate and he who
attempts it must first pass the point of this lance and so saying he
brandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not
but so deep an impression had the rejection of quiteria made on camachos
mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts and so the counsels
of the priest who was a wise and kindly disposed man prevailed with
him and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and
tranquillised and to prove it put up their swords again inveighing
against the pliancy of quiteria rather than the craftiness of basilio
camacho maintaining that if quiteria as a maiden had such a love for
basilio she would have loved him too as a married woman and that he
ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given
camacho and those of his following therefore being consoled and
pacified those on basilios side were appeased and the rich camacho to
show that he felt no resentment for the trick and did not care about it
desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality
neither basilio however nor his bride nor their followers would take
any part in it and they withdrew to basilios village for the poor if
they are persons of virtue and good sense have those who follow honour
and uphold them just as the rich have those who flatter and dance
attendance on them with them they carried don quixote regarding him as
a man of worth and a stout one sancho alone had a cloud on his soul for
he found himself debarred from waiting for camachos splendid feast and
festival which lasted until night and thus dragged away he moodily
followed his master who accompanied basilios party and left behind him
the flesh pots of egypt though in his heart he took them with him and
their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in the bucket
conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the
good cheer he was losing and so vexed and dejected though not hungry
without dismounting from dapple he followed in the footsteps of
wherin is related the grand adventure of the cave of montesinos in the
heart of la mancha which the valiant don quixote brought to a happy
many and great were the attentions shown to don quixote by the newly
married couple who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming
forward in defence of their cause and they exalted his wisdom to the
same level with his courage rating him as a cid in arms and a cicero in
eloquence worthy sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of
the pair from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme
arranged with the fair quiteria but a device of basilios who counted
on exactly the result they had seen he confessed it is true that he
had confided his idea to some of his friends so that at the proper time
they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the
that said don quixote is not and ought not to be called deception
which aims at virtuous ends and the marriage of lovers he maintained to
be a most excellent end reminding them however that love has no
greater enemy than hunger and constant want for love is all gaiety
enjoyment and happiness especially when the lover is in the possession
of the object of his love and poverty and want are the declared enemies
of all these which he said to urge senor basilio to abandon the practice
of those accomplishments he was skilled in for though they brought him
fame they brought him no money and apply himself to the acquisition of
wealth by legitimate industry which will never fail those who are
prudent and persevering the poor man who is a man of honour if indeed a
poor man can be a man of honour has a jewel when he has a fair wife and
if she is taken from him his honour is taken from him and slain the
fair woman who is a woman of honour and whose husband is poor deserves
to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph beauty
by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it and the royal eagles
