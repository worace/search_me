his questions strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed it was
and what is this bell which you wear on your knee
this replied fauchelevent is so that i may be avoided
ah goodness there are only women in this house many young girls it
appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet the bell gives them
not when you got me the place here as gardener
well then this is the petit picpus convent
memories recurred to jean valjean chance that is to say providence
had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine
where old fauchelevent crippled by the fall from his cart had been
admitted on his recommendation two years previously he repeated as
exactly returned old fauchelevent but to come to the point how the
deuce did you manage to get in here you father madeleine no matter if
you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here
still said jean valjean i must stay here
jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave
i was the first to recall it returned fauchelevent
well you can do to day for me that which i did for you in the olden
fauchelevent took in his aged trembling and wrinkled hands jean
valjeans two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though
oh that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make you
some little return for that save your life monsieur le maire dispose
a wonderful joy had transfigured this old man his countenance seemed to
what do you wish me to do he resumed
that i will explain to you you have a chamber
i have an isolated hovel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent
in a corner which no one ever looks into there are three rooms in it
the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly
arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived
good said jean valjean now i am going to ask two things of you
in the first place you are not to tell any one what you know about me
in the second you are not to try to find out anything more
as you please i know that you can do nothing that is not honest
that you have always been a man after the good gods heart and then
moreover you it was who placed me here that concerns you i am at your
that is settled then now come with me we will go and get the child
ah said fauchelevent so there is a child
he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows
less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again
before the flame of a good fire was lying asleep in the old gardeners
bed jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more his hat
which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up while
jean valjean was putting on his coat fauchelevent had removed the
bell and kneecap which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that
adorned the wall the two men were warming themselves with their elbows
resting on a table upon which fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese
black bread a bottle of wine and two glasses and the old man was
saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the latters knee
ah father madeleine you did not recognize me immediately you save
peoples lives and then you forget them that is bad but they remember
chapter x which explains how javert got on the scent
the events of which we have just beheld the reverse side so to speak
had come about in the simplest possible manner
when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had
arrested him beside fantines death bed had escaped from the town jail
of m sur m the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to
paris paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything
disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea no
forest hides a man as does that crowd fugitives of every sort know
this they go to paris as to an abyss there are gulfs which save the
police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they
have lost elsewhere they sought the ex mayor of m sur m javert was
summoned to paris to throw light on their researches javert had in
fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean
javerts zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by
m chabouillet secretary of the prefecture under comte angles m
chabouillet who had moreover already been javerts patron had the
inspector of m sur m attached to the police force of paris there
javert rendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem
he no longer thought of jean valjean the wolf of to day causes these
dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when
in december 1823 he read a newspaper he who never read newspapers
but javert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of
the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne just as
he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of
jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page the paper
announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact
in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it he confined himself
to the remark thats a good entry then he threw aside the paper and
some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted
from the prefecture of the seine et oise to the prefecture of police in
paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under
peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of montfermeil
a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had
been intrusted by her mother to an inn keeper of that neighborhood had
been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette
and was the daughter of a girl named fantine who had died in the
hospital it was not known where or when
this report came under javerts eye and set him to thinking
the name of fantine was well known to him he remembered that jean
valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a
respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that creatures
child he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris
at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for montfermeil
some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second
occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the
previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for
he had not been seen in the village itself what had he been intending
to do in that region of montfermeil it could not even be surmised
javert understood it now fantines daughter was there jean valjean was
going there in search of her and now this child had been stolen by a
stranger who could that stranger be could it be jean valjean but jean
valjean was dead javert without saying anything to anybody took the
coach from the pewter platter cul de sac de la planchette and made a
he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found
for the first few days the thenardiers had chattered in their rage the
disappearance of the lark had created a sensation in the village he
immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the
abduction of a child hence the police report but their first vexation
having passed off thenardier with his wonderful instinct had
very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the
prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the
abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon
himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering
eye of justice the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle
brought to them and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred
francs which he had received he turned squarely round put a gag on
his wifes mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was
mentioned to him he understood nothing about it no doubt he had
grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him
so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer
out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most
natural way in the world he added the grandfather which produced a
good effect this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at
montfermeil the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish
nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into
thenardiers history who was that grandfather and what was his name
thenardier replied with simplicity he is a wealthy farmer i saw his
passport i think his name was m guillaume lambert
lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name thereupon javert
jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am a ninny
he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of
march 1824 he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of
saint medard and who had been surnamed the mendicant who gives alms
this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew
exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who
knew nothing about herself save that she had come from montfermeil
montfermeil that name was always coming up and it made javert prick
up his ears an old beggar police spy an ex beadle to whom this person
had given alms added a few more details this gentleman of property was
very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one
except occasionally to the poor and never allowing any one to approach
him he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat which was worth many
millions being all wadded with bank bills this piqued javerts
curiosity in a decided manner in order to get a close look at this
fantastic gentleman without alarming him he borrowed the beadles
outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of
crouching every evening whining orisons through his nose and playing
the suspected individual did indeed approach javert thus disguised
and bestow alms on him at that moment javert raised his head and the
shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the
one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean
however the darkness might have misled him jean valjeans death was
official javert cherished very grave doubts and when in doubt javert
the man of scruples never laid a finger on any ones collar
he followed his man to the gorbeau house and got the old woman to
talking which was no difficult matter the old woman confirmed the fact
regarding the coat lined with millions and narrated to him the episode
of the thousand franc bill she had seen it she had handled it javert
hired a room that evening he installed himself in it he came and
listened at the mysterious lodgers door hoping to catch the sound of
his voice but jean valjean saw his candle through the key hole and
on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the
fall of the five franc piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing
the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and
made haste to warn javert at night when jean valjean came out javert
was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men
javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not
mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was
his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place
because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert
next because to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape
and was reputed dead on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed
forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort was a
magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would
assuredly not leave to a new comer like javert and he was afraid of
being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an
artist had a taste for the unforeseen he hated those well heralded
successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom
brushed off he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and
javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner
to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a single
instant even at the moments when jean valjean believed himself to
be the most secure javerts eye had been on him why had not javert
arrested jean valjean because he was still in doubt
it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely
at its ease the free press embarrassed it several arbitrary arrests
denounced by the newspapers had echoed even as far as the chambers and
had rendered the prefecture timid interference with individual liberty
was a grave matter the police agents were afraid of making a mistake
the prefect laid the blame on them a mistake meant dismissal the
reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced
by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged
grandfather with white hair a respectable and well to do gentleman
who was walking with his grandchild aged eight was arrested and
conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict
let us repeat in addition that javert had scruples of his own
injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the
jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark
sadness uneasiness anxiety depression this fresh misfortune of being
forced to flee by night to seek a chance refuge in paris for cosette
and himself the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of
the child all this without his being aware of it had altered jean
valjeans walk and impressed on his bearing such senility that the
police themselves incarnate in the person of javert might and did in
fact make a mistake the impossibility of approaching too close his
costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of thenardier which made
a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison
added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in javerts
for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his
papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a
good honest old fellow living on his income he was probably some merry
blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian
misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who gave alms to conceal
his other talents which was an old dodge he had trusty fellows
accomplices retreats in case of emergencies in which he would no
doubt take refuge all these turns which he was making through the
streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man to
arrest him too hastily would be to kill the hen that laid the golden
eggs where was the inconvenience in waiting javert was very sure that
thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to
himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage
it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the
brilliant light thrown from a dram shop he decidedly recognized jean
there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the
mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey
as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable
convict he perceived that there were only three of them and he asked
for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise one
puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel
this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his
agents came near causing him to lose the trail he speedily divined
however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his
pursuers and himself he bent his head and reflected like a blood hound
who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right
scent javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to
the bridge of austerlitz a word with the toll keeper furnished him with
the information which he required have you seen a man with a little
girl i made him pay two sous replied the toll keeper javert
reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small
illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by
the hand he saw him enter the rue du chemin vert saint antoine he
remembered the cul de sac genrot arranged there like a trap and of the
sole exit of the rue droit mur into the rue petit picpus he made sure
of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his
agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue a patrol which was
returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition
on it and caused it to accompany him in such games soldiers are aces
moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild
boar one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs these
combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught
between the blind alley genrot on the right his agent on the left and
himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff
then he began the game he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment
he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but
desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy
at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating
over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which
allows the fly to flutter and of the cat which lets the mouse run
claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements
of the creature imprisoned in their pincers what a delight this
javert was enjoying himself the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted
he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand
accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible
however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be
illustration javert on the hunt 2b5 10 javert on the hunt
javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the nooks of
the street like so many pockets of thieves
when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there
he interrogated his sentinel of the rues droit mur and petit picpus
that agent who had remained imperturbably at his post had not seen the
it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns that is to
say he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels and then the
oldest huntsmen know not what to say duvivier ligniville and desprez
halt short in a discomfiture of this sort artonge exclaims it was
not a stag but a sorcerer javert would have liked to utter the same
his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage
it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia
that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made
mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war
in scythia and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean
valjean he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the
exconvict the first glance should have sufficed him he was wrong in
not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong
in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de
pontoise he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the
full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advice is certainly
useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs
who deserve confidence but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is
chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict javert by taking
too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on
the trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so
made him run above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the
scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and
puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread he thought
himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the
game of the mouse and the lion at the same time he reckoned himself
as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement fatal
precaution waste of precious time javert committed all these blunders
and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that
ever existed he was in the full force of the term what is called in
venery a knowing dog but what is there that is perfect
the greatest follies are often composed like the largest ropes of
a multitude of strands take the cable thread by thread take all the
petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after
the other and you say that is all there is of it braid them twist
them together the result is enormous it is attila hesitating between
marcian on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal tarrying
at capua it is danton falling asleep at arcis sur aube
however that may be even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean
had escaped him javert did not lose his head sure that the convict who
had broken his ban could not be far off he established sentinels he
organized traps and ambuscades and beat the quarter all that night the
first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope
had been cut a precious sign which however led him astray since it
caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the cul de sac
genrot in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted
on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land
jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction the fact is
that had he penetrated a little further in the cul de sac genrot he
would probably have done so and have been lost javert explored these
gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a
at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to
the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been
nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage gate
than the carriage gate of number 62 rue petit picpus this entrance
which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion permitted a
view of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about
them a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines and the face
of a lounging porter above the wall at the bottom of the court tall
trees were visible when a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when
a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number
62 little picpus street without carrying away a smiling impression of
it nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse
the threshold smiled the house prayed and wept
if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was
even nearly impossible for every one for there was an open sesame
which it was necessary to know if the porter once passed one entered
a little vestibule on the right on which opened a staircase shut in
between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at
a time if one did not allow ones self to be alarmed by a daubing of
canary yellow with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase if
one ventured to ascend it one crossed a first landing then a second
and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and
the chocolate hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency
staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows the
corridor took a turn and became dark if one doubled this cape one
arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the
more mysterious because it was not fastened if one opened it one
found ones self in a little chamber about six feet square tiled
well scrubbed clean cold and hung with nankin paper with green
flowers at fifteen sous the roll a white dull light fell from a large
window with tiny panes on the left which usurped the whole width
of the room one gazed about but saw no one one listened one heard
neither a footstep nor a human murmur the walls were bare the chamber
was not furnished there was not even a chair
one looked again and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular
hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars
black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said
meshes of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length the little
green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to
those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by
their funereal contact supposing that a living being had been so
wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square
hole this grating would have prevented it it did not allow the passage
of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to
say of the mind this seems to have occurred to them for it had been
re enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear
and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of
a strainer at the bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced
exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box a bit of tape attached
to a bell wire hung at the right of the grated opening
if the tape was pulled a bell rang and one heard a voice very near at
it was a womans voice a gentle voice so gentle that it was mournful
here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know if
one did not know it the voice ceased the wall became silent once more
as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other
if one knew the password the voice resumed enter on the right
one then perceived on the right facing the window a glass door
surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray on raising the latch and
crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression
as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the
grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted one was in fact in
a sort of theatre box narrow furnished with two old chairs and a
much frayed straw matting sparely illuminated by the vague light from
the glass door a regular box with its front just of a height to lean
upon bearing a tablet of black wood this box was grated only
the grating of it was not of gilded wood as at the opera it was a
monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the
wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists
the first minutes passed when ones eyes began to grow used to this
cellar like half twilight one tried to pass the grating but got no
further than six inches beyond it there he encountered a barrier of
black shutters re enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood
painted a gingerbread yellow these shutters were divided into long
narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating they
were always closed at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice
i am here what do you wish with me
it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice no one was visible hardly
the sound of a breath was audible it seemed as though it were a spirit
which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the
if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions
the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit
became an apparition behind the grating behind the shutter one
perceived so far as the grating permitted sight a head of which only
the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black
veil one caught a glimpse of a black guimpe and a form that was barely
defined covered with a black shroud that head spoke with you but did
not look at you and never smiled at you
the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that
you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black this light was
nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which
was made in that place shut off from all glances a profound vagueness
enveloped that form clad in mourning your eyes searched that vagueness
and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition at the
expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see
nothing what you beheld was night emptiness shadows a wintry mist
mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence
from which you could gather nothing not even sighs a gloom in which
what you beheld was the interior of a cloister
it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called
the convent of the bernardines of the perpetual adoration the box in
which you stood was the parlor the first voice which had addressed you
was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent on the
other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron
grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor
the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the
parlor which had a window on the side of the world had none on the
side of the convent profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place
nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light
there was life in the midst of that death although this was the most
strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into
it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the
proper bounds things which story tellers have never seen and have
this convent which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in
the rue petit picpus was a community of bernardines of the obedience of
these bernardines were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like
the bernardine monks but to citeaux like the benedictine monks in
other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but of saint
any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin
verga founded in 1425 a congregation of bernardines benedictines
with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch
this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic
there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one
order on another to mention only a single order of saint benoit which
is here in question there are attached to this order without counting
the obedience of martin verga four congregations two in italy
mont cassin and sainte justine of padua two in france cluny and
saint maur and nine orders vallombrosa granmont the celestins
the camaldules the carthusians the humilies the olivateurs the
silvestrins and lastly citeaux for citeaux itself a trunk for other
orders is only an offshoot of saint benoit citeaux dates from saint
robert abbe de molesme in the diocese of langres in 1098 now it was
in 529 that the devil having retired to the desert of subiaco he
was old had he turned hermit was chased from the ancient temple of
apollo where he dwelt by saint benoit then aged seventeen
after the rule of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow
on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the
bernardines benedictines of martin verga they are clothed in black
with a guimpe which in accordance with the express command of
saint benoit mounts to the chin a robe of serge with large sleeves
a large woollen veil the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on
the breast the band which descends over their brow to their eyes this
is their dress all is black except the band which is white the
novices wear the same habit but all in white the professed nuns also
the bernardines benedictines of martin verga practise the perpetual
adoration like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament
who at the beginning of this century had two houses in paris one at
the temple the other in the rue neuve sainte genevieve however the
bernardines benedictines of the petit picpus of whom we are speaking
were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament
cloistered in the rue neuve sainte genevieve and at the temple there
were numerous differences in their rule there were some in their
costume the bernardines benedictines of the petit picpus wore the
black guimpe and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the
rue neuve sainte genevieve wore a white one and had besides on their
breasts a holy sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or
gilded copper the nuns of the petit picpus did not wear this holy
sacrament the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of
the petit picpus and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders
perfectly distinct their only resemblance lies in this practice of the
ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga just
as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of
all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus
christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless
widely separated and on occasion even hostile the oratory of italy
established at florence by philip de neri and the oratory of france
established by pierre de berulle the oratory of france claimed the
precedence since philip de neri was only a saint while berulle was a
let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verga
the bernardines benedictines of this obedience fast all the year
round abstain from meat fast in lent and on many other days which are
peculiar to them rise from their first sleep from one to three oclock
in the morning to read their breviary and chant matins sleep in all
seasons between serge sheets and on straw make no use of the bath
never light a fire scourge themselves every friday observe the rule of
silence speak to each other only during the recreation hours which are
very brief and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year from
september 14th which is the exaltation of the holy cross until easter
these six months are a modification the rule says all the year but
this drugget chemise intolerable in the heat of summer produced fevers
and nervous spasms the use of it had to be restricted even with this
palliation when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of september
they suffer from fever for three or four days obedience poverty
chastity perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows which
the prioress is elected for three years by the mothers who are called
meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter a prioress can
only be re elected twice which fixes the longest possible reign of a
they never see the officiating priest who is always hidden from them
by a serge curtain nine feet in height during the sermon when the
preacher is in the chapel they drop their veils over their faces they
must always speak low walk with their eyes on the ground and their
heads bowed one man only is allowed to enter the convent the
there is really one other the gardener but he is always an old man
and in order that he may always be alone in the garden and that the
nuns may be warned to avoid him a bell is attached to his knee
their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive it is the
canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation as at the
voice of christ ut voci christi at a gesture at the first sign
ad nutum ad primum signum immediately with cheerfulness with
perseverance with a certain blind obedience prompte hilariter
perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia as the file in the hand of the
workman quasi limam in manibus fabri without power to read or to write
without express permission legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine
each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation the reparation
is the prayer for all the sins for all the faults for all the
dissensions for all the violations for all the iniquities for all the
crimes committed on earth for the space of twelve consecutive hours
from four oclock in the afternoon till four oclock in the morning or
from four oclock in the morning until four oclock in the afternoon
the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone
before the holy sacrament with hands clasped a rope around her neck
when her fatigue becomes unendurable she prostrates herself flat on
her face against the earth with her arms outstretched in the form of a
cross this is her only relief in this attitude she prays for all the
guilty in the universe this is great to sublimity
as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle it
is called without distinction to make reparation or to be at the post
the nuns even prefer out of humility this last expression which
to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed
the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall
besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy
sacrament this station lasts an hour they relieve each other like
soldiers on guard this is the perpetual adoration
the prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with
peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments
in the life of jesus christ as mother nativity mother conception
mother presentation mother passion but the names of saints are not
when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths
all their teeth are yellow no tooth brush ever entered that convent
brushing ones teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the
they never say my they possess nothing of their own and they must not
attach themselves to anything they call everything our thus our veil
our chaplet if they were speaking of their chemise they would say our
chemise sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book
of hours a relic a medal that has been blessed as soon as they become
aware that they are growing attached to this object they must give it
up they recall the words of saint therese to whom a great lady said
as she was on the point of entering her order permit me mother to
send for a bible to which i am greatly attached ah you are attached
to something in that case do not enter our order
every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up to have a place
of her own a chamber they live with their cells open when they meet
one says blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
the other responds forever the same ceremony when one taps at the
others door hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the
other side is heard to say hastily forever like all practices this
becomes mechanical by force of habit and one sometimes says forever
before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence praised
and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
among the visitandines the one who enters says ave maria and the one
whose cell is entered says gratia plena it is their way of saying
good day which is in fact full of grace
at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the
church bell of the convent at this signal prioress vocal mothers
professed nuns lay sisters novices postulants interrupt what they
are saying what they are doing or what they are thinking and all say
in unison if it is five oclock for instance at five oclock and at
all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
if it is eight oclock at eight oclock and at all hours and so on
this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought
and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the
formula alone varies thus at the infant jesus they say at this
hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kindle my heart the
bernardines benedictines of martin verga cloistered fifty years ago at
petit picpus chant the offices to a solemn psalmody a pure gregorian
chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office
everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause and say in
a low voice jesus marie joseph for the office of the dead they adopt
a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a
depth the effect produced is striking and tragic
the nuns of the petit picpus had made a vault under their grand altar
for the burial of their community the government as they say does not
permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they
die this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an
they had obtained a mediocre consolation at best permission to be
interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient
vaugirard cemetery which was made of land which had formerly belonged
on fridays the nuns hear high mass vespers and all the offices as on
sunday they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals
unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so
prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain
and italy their stations in the chapel are interminable as for the
number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of
them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them the prayers
of the postulants are frightful the prayers of the novices are still
worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse
once a week the chapter assembles the prioress presides the vocal
mothers assist each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses
aloud in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has
committed during the week the vocal mothers consult after each
besides this confession in a loud tone for which all faults in the
least serious are reserved they have for their venial offences what
they call the coulpe to make ones coulpe means to prostrate ones self
flat on ones face during the office in front of the prioress until
the latter who is never called anything but our mother notifies the
culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that
she can rise the coulpe or peccavi is made for a very small matter a
broken glass a torn veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an
office a false note in church etc this suffices and the coulpe
is made the coulpe is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person
herself the word is etymologically in its place here who judges
herself and inflicts it on herself on festival days and sundays four
mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading desk with
four places one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm
beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three
notes do si sol for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent a
coulpe which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault
enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed
when a nun is summoned to the parlor even were it the prioress herself
she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is
the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers the others can
see only their immediate family and that very rarely if by chance
an outsider presents herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and
loved in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required
if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted the nun
comes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only
for a mother or sister it is unnecessary to say that permission is
such is the rule of saint benoit aggravated by martin verga
these nuns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other
orders often are they are pale and grave between 1825 and 1830 three
one is a postulant for two years at least often for four a novice for
four it is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced
earlier than the age of twenty three or twenty four years the
bernardines benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their
in their cells they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations
on the day when a novice makes her profession she is dressed in her
handsomest attire she is crowned with white roses her hair is brushed
until it shines and curled then she prostrates herself a great black
veil is thrown over her and the office for the dead is sung then the
nuns separate into two files one file passes close to her saying in
plaintive accents our sister is dead and the other file responds in
a voice of ecstasy our sister is alive in jesus christ
at the epoch when this story takes place a boarding school was attached
to the convent a boarding school for young girls of noble and
mostly wealthy families among whom could be remarked mademoiselle
de saint aulaire and de belissen and an english girl bearing the
illustrious catholic name of talbot these young girls reared by these
nuns between four walls grew up with a horror of the world and of the
age one of them said to us one day the sight of the street pavement
made me shudder from head to foot they were dressed in blue with a
white cap and a holy spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast
on certain grand festival days particularly saint marthas day they
were permitted as a high favor and a supreme happiness to dress
themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of
saint benoit for a whole day in the early days the nuns were in the
habit of lending them their black garments this seemed profane and
the prioress forbade it only the novices were permitted to lend it is
remarkable that these performances tolerated and encouraged no doubt
in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order
to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit were a genuine
happiness and a real recreation for the scholars they simply amused
themselves with it it was new it gave them a change candid reasons
of childhood which do not however succeed in making us worldlings
comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in ones hand
and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of
the pupils conformed with the exception of the austerities to all the
practices of the convent there was a certain young woman who entered
the world and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in
breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any
one knocked at her door forever like the nuns the pupils saw
their relatives only in the parlor their very mothers did not obtain
permission to embrace them the following illustrates to what a degree
severity on that point was carried one day a young girl received a
visit from her mother who was accompanied by a little sister three
years of age the young girl wept for she wished greatly to embrace
her sister impossible she begged that at least the child might be
permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could
none the less these young girls filled this grave house with charming
at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister the recreation
hour struck a door swung on its hinges the birds said good
here come the children an irruption of youth inundated that garden
intersected with a cross like a shroud radiant faces white foreheads
innocent eyes full of merry light all sorts of auroras were scattered
about amid these shadows after the psalmodies the bells the peals
and knells and offices the sound of these little girls burst forth on a
sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees the hive of joy was opened
and each one brought her honey they played they called to each other
they formed into groups they ran about pretty little white teeth
chattered in the corners the veils superintended the laughs from a
distance shades kept watch of the sunbeams but what mattered it still
they beamed and laughed those four lugubrious walls had their moment
of dazzling brilliancy they looked on vaguely blanched with the
reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives it was
like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning the young
girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns the gaze of impeccability
does not embarrass innocence thanks to these children there was
among so many austere hours one hour of ingenuousness the little ones
skipped about the elder ones danced in this cloister play was mingled
with heaven nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh
expanding young souls homer would have come thither to laugh with
perrault and there was in that black garden youth health noise
cries giddiness pleasure happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles
of all their ancestresses those of the epic as well as those of the
fairy tale those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage
in that house more than anywhere else perhaps arise those childrens
sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of
thoughtfulness it was between those four gloomy walls that a child of
five years exclaimed one day mother one of the big girls has just
told me that i have only nine years and ten months longer to remain
it was here too that this memorable dialogue took place
a vocal mother why are you weeping my child
the child aged six i told alix that i knew my french history she
says that i do not know it but i do
alix the big girl aged nine no she does not know it
alix she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question
in the book and she would answer it
let us see about it what did you ask her
i opened the book at random as she proposed and i put the first
it was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy
