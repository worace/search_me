he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man through
a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and
arrangements he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how
unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities and how often
in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions
and new paths he knows still better from his painfulest recollections
on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank
have hitherto usually gone to pieces broken down sunk and become
contemptible the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of
the man of the future as idealized by the socialistic fools and
shallow pates this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely
gregarious animal or as they call it to a man of free society
this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims is
undoubtedly possible he who has thought out this possibility to its
ultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest of
204 at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that
which it has always been namely resolutely montrer ses plaies
according to balzac i would venture to protest against an improper and
injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and as if with the
best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations
of science and philosophy i mean to say that one must have the right
out of ones own experience experience as it seems to me always
implies unfortunate experience to treat of such an important question
of rank so as not to speak of colour like the blind or against science
like women and artists ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct
and their shame it always finds things out the declaration of
independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy
is one of the subtler after effects of democratic organization and
disorganization the self glorification and self conceitedness of
the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its best
springtime which does not mean to imply that in this case self praise
smells sweet here also the instinct of the populace cries freedom
from all masters and after science has with the happiest results
resisted theology whose hand maid it had been too long it now
proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for
philosophy and in its turn to play the master what am i saying
to play the philosopher on its own account my memory the memory of
a scientific man if you please teems with the naivetes of insolence
which i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young
naturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured and
most conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasters
who are both the one and the other by profession on one occasion it
was the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the
defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities at another time
it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined
luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt
himself aggrieved and belittled thereby on another occasion it was the
colour blindness of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy but
a series of refuted systems and an extravagant expenditure which does
nobody any good at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of
the boundary adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another
time the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarily
extended to disregard of philosophy generally in fine i found most
frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars
the evil after effect of some particular philosopher to whom on the
whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his
scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of the
result being a general ill will to all philosophy such seems to
me for instance the after effect of schopenhauer on the most modern
germany by his unintelligent rage against hegel he has succeeded in
severing the whole of the last generation of germans from its connection
with german culture which culture all things considered has been
an elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense but
precisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptive
and un german to the extent of ingeniousness on the whole speaking
generally it may just have been the humanness all too humanness of the
modern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness which
has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the
doors to the instinct of the populace let it but be acknowledged to
what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the
world of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royal
and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called and with what
justice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family and
origin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing to
the fashion of the present day are just as much aloft as they are down
below in germany for instance the two lions of berlin the anarchist
eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann it is especially
the sight of those hotch potch philosophers who call themselves
realists or positivists which is calculated to implant a
dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those
philosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialists
that is very evident all of them are persons who have been vanquished
and brought back again under the dominion of science who at one time
or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the
more and its responsibility and who now creditably rancorously and
vindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the master task
and supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwise
science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible
on its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy has
gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites
distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to
a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of
epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even
gets beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the right
to enter that is philosophy in its last throes an end an agony
something that awakens pity how could such a philosophy rule
205 the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in
fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit
could still come to maturity the extent and towering structure of the
sciences have increased enormously and therewith also the probability
that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner or will attach
himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to
his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection
and his despection or he gets aloft too late when the best of his
maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and
deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of things is no
longer of much importance it is perhaps just the refinement of his
intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the
way he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a
milleantenna he knows too well that as a discerner one who has lost
his self respect no longer commands no longer leads unless he should
aspire to become a great play actor a philosophical cagliostro and
spiritual rat catcher in short a misleader this is in the last
instance a question of taste if it has not really been a question of
conscience to double once more the philosophers difficulties there is
also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict a yea or nay not
concerning science but concerning life and the worth of life he learns
unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain
this verdict and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief
only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying
experiences often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded in fact the
philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either
with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously
man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he lives
wisely or as a philosopher it hardly means anything more than
prudently and apart wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind
of flight a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a
bad game but the genuine philosopher does it not seem so to us
my friends lives unphilosophically and unwisely above all
imprudently and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts
and temptations of life he risks himself constantly he plays this bad
206 in relation to the genius that is to say a being who either
engenders or produces both words understood in their fullest sense the
man of learning the scientific average man has always something of
the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two
principal functions of man to both of course to the scholar and
to the old maid one concedes respectability as if by way of
indemnification in these cases one emphasizes the respectability and
yet in the compulsion of this concession one has the same admixture
of vexation let us examine more closely what is the scientific man
firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues that is
to say a non ruling non authoritative and non self sufficient type
of man he possesses industry patient adaptableness to rank and file
equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he has the
instinct for people like himself and for that which they require for
instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which
there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration
which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability
the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and
usefulness with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of
the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals has again and
again to be overcome the learned man as is appropriate has also
maladies and faults of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and
has a lynx eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations
he cannot attain he is confiding yet only as one who lets himself go
but does not flow and precisely before the man of the great current he
stands all the colder and more reserved his eye is then like a smooth
and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy
the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results
from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the jesuitism of
mediocrity which labours instinctively for the destruction of
the exceptional man and endeavours to break or still better to
relax every bent bow to relax of course with consideration and
naturally with an indulgent hand to relax with confiding sympathy
that is the real art of jesuitism which has always understood how to
207 however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit and
who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded
ipsisimosity in the end however one must learn caution even with
regard to ones gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with
which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been
celebrated as if it were the goal in itself as if it were salvation
and glorification as is especially accustomed to happen in the
pessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the
highest honours to disinterested knowledge the objective man who no
longer curses and scolds like the pessimist the ideal man of learning
in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand
complete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costly
instruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more
powerful he is only an instrument we may say he is a mirror he is no
purpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed
to prostration before everything that wants to be known with such
desires only as knowing or reflecting implies he waits until
something comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even the
light footsteps and gliding past of spiritual beings may not be lost on
his surface and film whatever personality he still possesses seems to
him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has he
come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms
and events he calls up the recollection of himself with an effort
and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other
persons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here only
is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health
or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack
of companions and society indeed he sets himself to reflect on his
suffering but in vain his thoughts already rove away to the more
general case and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how
to help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote time
to himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack
of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual
complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiant
and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that
comes his way his habit of inconsiderate good nature of dangerous
indifference as to yea and nay alas there are enough of cases in which
he has to atone for these virtues of his and as man generally he
becomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtues should one
wish love or hatred from him i mean love and hatred as god woman and
animal understand them he will do what he can and furnish what he can
but one must not be surprised if it should not be much if he should
show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and
deteriorated his love is constrained his hatred is artificial and
rather un tour de force a slight ostentation and exaggeration he is
only genuine so far as he can be objective only in his serene totality
is he still nature and natural his mirroring and eternally
self polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm no longer how to
deny he does not command neither does he destroy je ne meprise
presque rien he says with leibniz let us not overlook nor undervalue
the presque neither is he a model man he does not go in advance of any
one nor after either he places himself generally too far off to have
any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil if he has
been so long confounded with the philosopher with the caesarian trainer
and dictator of civilization he has had far too much honour and what
is more essential in him has been overlooked he is an instrument
something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but
nothing in himself presque rien the objective man is an instrument
a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and
mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he
is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the
rest of existence justifies itself no termination and still less a
commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful
self centred that wants to be master but rather only a soft inflated
delicate movable potters form that must wait for some kind of content
and frame to shape itself thereto for the most part a man without
frame and content a selfless man consequently also nothing for
208 when a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic i
hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the
objective spirit people all hear it impatiently they regard him on
that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many
many questions indeed among timid hearers of whom there are now so
many he is henceforth said to be dangerous with his repudiation of
skepticism it seems to them as if they heard some evil threatening
sound in the distance as if a new kind of explosive were being tried
somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered russian
nihiline a pessimism bonae voluntatis that not only denies means
denial but dreadful thought practises denial against this kind of
good will a will to the veritable actual negation of life there is
as is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative
than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism
and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an
antidote to the spirit and its underground noises are not our ears
already full of bad sounds say the skeptics as lovers of repose and
almost as a kind of safety police this subterranean nay is terrible
be still ye pessimistic moles the skeptic in effect that delicate
creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so
as to start at every nay and even at that sharp decided yea and feels
something like a bite thereby yea and nay they seem to him opposed
to morality he loves on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue
by a noble aloofness while perhaps he says with montaigne what do i
know or with socrates i know that i know nothing or here i do
not trust myself no door is open to me or even if the door were
open why should i enter immediately or what is the use of any hasty
hypotheses it might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses
at all are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is
crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not time
enough for that has not the time leisure oh ye demons can ye not
at all wait the uncertain also has its charms the sphinx too is a
circe and circe too was a philosopher thus does a skeptic console
himself and in truth he needs some consolation for skepticism is
the most spiritual expression of a certain many sided physiological
temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and
sickliness it arises whenever races or classes which have been long
separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another in the new
generation which has inherited as it were different standards and
valuations in its blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and
tentativeness the best powers operate restrictively the very virtues
prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast
and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul that however
which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the
will they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or
the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing they are doubtful of the
freedom of the will even in their dreams our present day europe
the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of
classes and consequently of races is therefore skeptical in all its
heights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which
springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with
gloomy aspect like a cloud over charged with interrogative signs and
often sick unto death of its will paralysis of will where do we not
find this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes how
seductively ornamented there are the finest gala dresses and disguises
for this disease and that for instance most of what places itself
nowadays in the show cases as objectiveness the scientific spirit
lart pour lart and pure voluntary knowledge is only decked out
skepticism and paralysis of will i am ready to answer for this
diagnosis of the european disease the disease of the will is diffused
unequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilization
has longest prevailed it decreases according as the barbarian
still or again asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western
culture it is therefore in the france of today as can be readily
disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and france
which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the
portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive
now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe
by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the
power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already
somewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of germany it
is stronger than in central germany it is considerably stronger in
england spain and corsica associated with phlegm in the former and
with hard skulls in the latter not to mention italy which is too young
yet to know what it wants and must first show whether it can exercise
will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense
middle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia namely in
russia there the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated
there the will uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative waits
threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our
physicists perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia would
be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger but also internal
subversion the shattering of the empire into small states and above
all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the
obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do not
say this as one who desires it in my heart i should rather prefer the
contrary i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of
russia that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally
threatening namely to acquire one will by means of a new caste to
rule over the continent a persistent dreadful will of its own that
can set its aims thousands of years ahead so that the long spun out
comedy of its petty statism and its dynastic as well as its democratic
many willed ness might finally be brought to a close the time for
petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the
dominion of the world the compulsion to great politics
209 as to how far the new warlike age on which we europeans have
evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger
kind of skepticism i should like to express myself preliminarily
merely by a parable which the lovers of german history will already
understand that unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadiers
who as king of prussia brought into being a military and skeptical
genius and therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged
type of german the problematic crazy father of frederick the great
had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew
what was then lacking in germany the want of which was a hundred times
more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form his
ill will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound
instinct men were lacking and he suspected to his bitterest regret
that his own son was not man enough there however he deceived
himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place he saw
his son lapsed to atheism to the esprit to the pleasant frivolity of
clever frenchmen he saw in the background the great bloodsucker the
spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no
longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no
longer commands is no longer able to command meanwhile however
there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous
skepticism who knows to what extent it was encouraged just by
his fathers hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to
solitude the skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related
to the genius for war and conquest and made its first entrance into
germany in the person of the great frederick this skepticism despises
and nevertheless grasps it undermines and takes possession it does
not believe but it does not thereby lose itself it gives the spirit a
dangerous liberty but it keeps strict guard over the heart it is the
german form of skepticism which as a continued fredericianism risen
to the highest spirituality has kept europe for a considerable time
under the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historical
distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character
of the great german philologists and historical critics who
rightly estimated were also all of them artists of destruction
and dissolution a new conception of the german spirit gradually
established itself in spite of all romanticism in music and
philosophy in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was
decidedly prominent whether for instance as fearlessness of gaze as
courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or as resolute will to
dangerous voyages of discovery to spiritualized north pole expeditions
under barren and dangerous skies there may be good grounds for it when
warm blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this
spirit cet esprit fataliste ironique mephistophelique as michelet
calls it not without a shudder but if one would realize how
characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which
awakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind the
former conception which had to be overcome by this new one and that
it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with
unbridled presumption to recommend the germans to the interest of
europe as gentle good hearted weak willed and poetical fools
finally let us only understand profoundly enough napoleons
astonishment when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded for
centuries as the german spirit voila un homme that was as much as
to say but this is a man and i only expected to see a german
210 supposing then that in the picture of the philosophers of the
future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps
be skeptics in the last mentioned sense something in them would only be
designated thereby and not they themselves with equal right they might
call themselves critics and assuredly they will be men of experiments
by the name with which i ventured to baptize them i have already
expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is
this because as critics in body and soul they will love to make use
of experiments in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense in
their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and
painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic
century can approve of there is no doubt these coming ones will be
least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities
which distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty as to
standards of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method
the wary courage the standing alone and the capacity for
self responsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a delight
in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which knows
how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds
they will be sterner and perhaps not always towards themselves only
than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in
order that it may please them or elevate and inspire them they
will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revels
for the feelings they will smile those rigorous spirits when any one
says in their presence that thought elevates me why should it not be
true or that work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or
that artist enlarges me why should he not be great perhaps they
will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus
rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one
could look into their inmost hearts he would not easily find therein
the intention to reconcile christian sentiments with antique taste
or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation
necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and
consequently very conciliatory century critical discipline and every
habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters
will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of
the future they may even make a display thereof as their special
adornment nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that
account it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to
have it decreed as is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is
criticism and critical science and nothing else whatever though this
estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivists of
france and germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste
of kant let us call to mind the titles of his principal works our new
philosophers will say notwithstanding that critics are instruments of
the philosopher and just on that account as instruments they are
far from being philosophers themselves even the great chinaman of
211 i insist upon it that people finally cease confounding
philosophical workers and in general scientific men with
philosophers that precisely here one should strictly give each his
own and not give those far too much these far too little it may
be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself
should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants
the scientific workers of philosophy remain standing and must remain
standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist
and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and
riddle reader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost
everything in order to traverse the whole range of human values
and estimations and that he may be able with a variety of eyes and
consciences to look from a height to any distance from a depth up
to any height from a nook into any expanse but all these are only
preliminary conditions for his task this task itself demands something
else it requires him to create values the philosophical workers after
the excellent pattern of kant and hegel have to fix and formalize some
great existing body of valuations that is to say former determinations
of value creations of value which have become prevalent and are for
a time called truths whether in the domain of the logical the
political moral or the artistic it is for these investigators to
make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous
conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long
even time itself and to subjugate the entire past an immense and
wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all
tenacious will can surely find satisfaction the real philosophers
however are commanders and law givers they say thus shall it be
they determine first the whither and the why of mankind and thereby
set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers and all
subjugators of the past they grasp at the future with a creative
hand and whatever is and was becomes for them thereby a means an
instrument and a hammer their knowing is creating their creating
is a law giving their will to truth is will to power are there at
present such philosophers have there ever been such philosophers must
212 it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher as a man
indispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow has ever
found himself and has been obliged to find himself in contradiction
to the day in which he lives his enemy has always been the ideal of his
day hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one
calls philosophers who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom
but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators have found
their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end
however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of
their age in putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very
virtues of their age they have betrayed their own secret it has been
for the sake of a new greatness of man a new untrodden path to
his aggrandizement they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy
indolence self indulgence and self neglect how much falsehood was
concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality how
much virtue was outlived they have always said we must remove hence to
where you are least at home in the face of a world of modern ideas
which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a
philosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelled
to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely
in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his all roundness he
would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety
of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the
extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the
taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is
so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently in
the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity
for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception
of greatness with as good a right as the opposite doctrine with its
ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity was suited to
an opposite age such as the sixteenth century which suffered from its
accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and floods
of selfishness in the time of socrates among men only of worn out
instincts old conservative athenians who let themselves go for the
sake of happiness as they said for the sake of pleasure as their
conduct indicated and who had continually on their lips the old pompous
words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led
irony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked socratic
assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his
own flesh as into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that
said plainly enough do not dissemble before me here we are equal
at present on the contrary when throughout europe the herding animal
alone attains to honours and dispenses honours when equality of
right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong i mean to
say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged
against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher
responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordliness at present
it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be
apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live
by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his
own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most
solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good
and evil the master of his virtues and of super abundance of will
precisely this shall be called greatness as diversified as can be
entire as ample as can be full and to ask once more the question is
213 it is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it cannot
be taught one must know it by experience or one should have the
pride not to know it the fact that at present people all talk of things
of which they cannot have any experience is true more especially
and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical
matters the very few know them are permitted to know them and
all popular ideas about them are false thus for instance the truly
philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which runs
at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no
false step is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own
experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their
presence it is incredible to them they conceive of every necessity as
troublesome as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint
thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating
almost as a trouble and often enough as worthy of the sweat of the
noble but not at all as something easy and divine closely related
to dancing and exuberance to think and to take a matter seriously
arduously that is one and the same thing to them such only has been
their experience artists have here perhaps a finer intuition they
who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything
arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom
of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping
reaches its climax in short that necessity and freedom of will are
then the same thing with them there is in fine a gradation of rank
in psychical states to which the gradation of rank in the problems
corresponds and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who
ventures too near them without being predestined for their solution
by the loftiness and power of his spirituality of what use is it for
nimble everyday intellects or clumsy honest mechanics and empiricists
to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problems and as
it were into this holy of holies as so often happens nowadays but
coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets this is provided for in
the primary law of things the doors remain closed to those intruders
though they may dash and break their heads thereon people have always
to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be bred
for it a person has only a right to philosophy taking the word in
its higher significance in virtue of his descent the ancestors the
blood decide here also many generations must have prepared the way
for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtues must have been
separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the
bold easy delicate course and current of his thoughts but above all
the readiness for great responsibilities the majesty of ruling glance
and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with
their duties and virtues the kindly patronage and defense of whatever
is misunderstood and calumniated be it god or devil the delight and
practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of
will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely looks up rarely
214 our virtues it is probable that we too have still our virtues
although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on
account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little
distance from us we europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings
of the twentieth century with all our dangerous curiosity our
multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly
sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit we shall presumably if we must
have virtues have those only which have come to agreement with our most
secret and heartfelt inclinations with our most ardent requirements
well then let us look for them in our labyrinths where as we know
so many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost and is
there anything finer than to search for ones own virtues is it not
almost to believe in ones own virtues but this believing in ones
own virtues is it not practically the same as what was formerly called
ones good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea
which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads and often enough
also behind their understandings it seems therefore that however
little we may imagine ourselves to be old fashioned and grandfatherly
respectable in other respects in one thing we are nevertheless the
worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers we last europeans with good
consciences we also still wear their pigtail ah if you only knew how
soon so very soon it will be different
215 as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which
determine the path of one planet and in certain cases suns of different
colours shine around a single planet now with red light now with
green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley
colours so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our
firmament are determined by different moralities our actions shine
alternately in different colours and are seldom unequivocal and there
are often cases also in which our actions are motley coloured
216 to love ones enemies i think that has been well learnt it takes
place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale indeed
at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place we learn to despise
when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however
unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and
secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word
and the formula of virtue morality as attitude is opposed to our taste
nowadays this is also an advance as it was an advance in our fathers
that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste
including the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion and all
that formerly belonged to freethinker pantomime it is the music in our
conscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litanies moral
217 let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance
to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment
they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before us
or even with regard to us they inevitably become our instinctive
calumniators and detractors even when they still remain our
friends blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of
218 the psychologists of france and where else are there still
psychologists nowadays have never yet exhausted their bitter and
manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just as though in
short they betray something thereby flaubert for instance the honest
citizen of rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the
end it was his mode of self torment and refined cruelty as this is
growing wearisome i would now recommend for a change something else
for a pleasure namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat
honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks
they have to perform the subtle barbed jesuitical astuteness which
is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the
middle class in its best moments subtler even than the understanding of
its victims a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent
of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered in
short you psychologists study the philosophy of the rule in its
struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for gods
and godlike malignity or in plainer words practise vivisection on
good people on the homo bonae voluntatis on yourselves
219 the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite
revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so it is
also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature
and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming
subtle malice spiritualises they are glad in their inmost heart that
there is a standard according to which those who are over endowed with
intellectual goods and privileges are equal to them they contend for
the equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god for
this purpose it is among them that the most powerful antagonists of
atheism are found if any one were to say to them a lofty spirituality
is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely
moral man it would make them furious i shall take care not to say
so i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality
itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities that it
is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man
after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice
perhaps during a whole series of generations that lofty spirituality
is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity
which knows that it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in the
world even among things and not only among men
220 now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular
one must probably not without some danger get an idea of what people
actually take an interest in and what are the things generally which
fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men including the
cultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also if
appearances do not deceive the fact thereby becomes obvious that the
greater part of what interests and charms higher natures and more
refined and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting to
the average man if notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these
interests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible to
act disinterestedly there have been philosophers who could give this
popular astonishment a seductive and mystical other worldly expression
perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience
instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that
disinterested action is very interesting and interested action
provided that and love what even an action for loves sake
shall be unegoistic but you fools  and the praise of the
self sacrificer but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that
he wanted and obtained something for it perhaps something from himself
for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have
more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more
but this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious
spirit does not like to stay for here truth has to stifle her yawns so
much when she is obliged to answer and after all truth is a woman one
221 it sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and
trifle retailer that i honour and respect an unselfish man not
however because he is unselfish but because i think he has a right to
be useful to another man at his own expense in short the question
is always who he is and who the other is for instance in a person
created and destined for command self denial and modest retirement
instead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues so it seems
to me every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself
unconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against good
taste but is also an incentive to sins of omission an additional
seduction under the mask of philanthropy and precisely a seduction and
injury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men moral
systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations of
rank their presumption must be driven home to their conscience until
they thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that what
is right for one is proper for another so said my moralistic pedant
and bonhomme did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus
exhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not be
too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ones own
side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste
222 wherever sympathy fellow suffering is preached nowadays and
if i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached let the
psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all the
noise which is natural to these preachers as to all preachers he will
hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of self contempt it belongs
to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which has been on
the increase for a century the first symptoms of which are already
specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame
depinay if it is not really the cause thereof the man of
modern ideas the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with
himself this is perfectly certain he suffers and his vanity wants him
223 the hybrid european a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in
all absolutely requires a costume he needs history as a storeroom
of costumes to be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit him
properly he changes and changes let us look at the nineteenth century
with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades
of style and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account
of nothing suiting us it is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic
or classical or christian or florentine or barocco or national
in moribus et artibus it does not clothe us but the spirit
especially the historical spirit profits even by this desperation
once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested
put on taken off packed up and above all studied we are the first
studious age in puncto of costumes i mean as concerns morals
articles of belief artistic tastes and religions we are prepared as
no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the
most spiritual festival laughter and arrogance for the transcendental
height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world perhaps
we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the
domain where even we can still be original probably as parodists of
the worlds history and as gods merry andrews perhaps though nothing
else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a
224 the historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly
the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people a
community or an individual has lived the divining instinct for the
relationships of these valuations for the relation of the authority
of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces this
historical sense which we europeans claim as our specialty has come
to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi barbarity into which
europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and
races it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this
faculty as its sixth sense owing to this mingling the past of every
form and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closely
contiguous and superimposed on one another flows forth into us modern
souls our instincts now run back in all directions we ourselves are
a kind of chaos in the end as we have said the spirit perceives its
advantage therein by means of our semi barbarity in body and in desire
we have secret access everywhere such as a noble age never had we have
access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations and to
every form of semi barbarity that has at any time existed on earth and
in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto
has just been semi barbarity the historical sense implies almost the
sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything
whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense for
instance we enjoy homer once more it is perhaps our happiest
acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men of
distinguished culture as the french of the seventeenth century like
saint evremond who reproached him for his esprit vaste and even
voltaire the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easily
appropriate whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy the very
decided yea and nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their
hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of
the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of
every distinguished and self sufficing culture to avow a new desire
a dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what is
strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards
the best things of the world which are not their property or could not
become their prey and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men
than just this historical sense with its truckling plebeian
curiosity the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelous
spanish moorish saxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenian
of the circle of aeschylus would have half killed himself with laughter
or irritation but we accept precisely this wild motleyness this
medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial
with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it as a refinement
of art reserved expressly for us and allow ourselves to be as little
disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english
populace in which shakespeares art and taste lives as perhaps on
the chiaja of naples where with all our senses awake we go our way
enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drain odour of the lower
quarters of the town that as men of the historical sense we have
our virtues is not to be disputed we are unpretentious unselfish
modest brave habituated to self control and self renunciation very
grateful very patient very complaisant but with all this we are
perhaps not very tasteful let us finally confess it that what is
most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp feel
taste and love what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost
hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every
culture and art the essentially noble in works and men their moment
of smooth sea and halcyon self sufficiency the goldenness and coldness
which all things show that have perfected themselves perhaps our great
virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste
at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves
imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and
happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and
there those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has
voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite when a
super abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking
and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still
trembling ground proportionateness is strange to us let us confess it
to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the
immeasurable like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the
reins fall before the infinite we modern men we semi barbarians and
are only in our highest bliss when we are in most danger
225 whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism
all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according
to pleasure and pain that is according to accompanying circumstances
and secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought and
naivetes which every one conscious of creative powers and an artists
conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy
sympathy for you to be sure that is not sympathy as you understand
it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with its
sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie
on the ground around us still less is it sympathy for the grumbling
vexed revolutionary slave classes who strive after power they call it
freedom our sympathy is a loftier and further sighted sympathy we
see how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him and there are moments
when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist
it when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind
of levity you want if possible and there is not a more foolish if
possible to do away with suffering and we it really seems that we
would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been
well being as you understand it is certainly not a goal it seems
to us an end a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and
contemptible and makes his destruction desirable the discipline
of suffering of great suffering know ye not that it is only this
discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto
the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy
its shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and bravery
in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and
whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness has
been bestowed upon the soul has it not been bestowed through suffering
through the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creator
are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire
folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness
of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day do
ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creature
in man applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forged
stretched roasted annealed refined to that which must necessarily
suffer and is meant to suffer and our sympathy do ye not understand
what our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy as
the worst of all pampering and enervation so it is sympathy against
sympathy but to repeat it once more there are higher problems than
the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all systems of
philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes
226 we immoralists this world with which we are concerned in which
we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of
delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every
respect captious insidious sharp and tender yes it is well
protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity we are
woven into a strong net and garment of duties and cannot disengage
ourselves precisely here we are men of duty even we occasionally
it is true we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords it
is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the
circumstances and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot but
do what we will fools and appearances say of us these are men without
duty we have always fools and appearances against us
227 honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid
ourselves we free spirits well we will labour at it with all our
perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our
virtue which alone remains may its glance some day overspread like
a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull
gloomy seriousness and if nevertheless our honesty should one day
grow weary and sigh and stretch its limbs and find us too hard and
would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable
vice let us remain hard we latest stoics and let us send to its
help whatever devilry we have in us our disgust at the clumsy
and undefined our nitimur in vetitum our love of adventure
our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised
intellectual will to power and universal conquest which rambles and
roves avidiously around all the realms of the future let us go with all
our devils to the help of our god it is probable that people will
misunderstand and mistake us on that account what does it matter they
will say their honesty that is their devilry and nothing else
what does it matter and even if they were right have not all gods
hitherto been such sanctified re baptized devils and after all what
do we know of ourselves and what the spirit that leads us wants to be
called it is a question of names and how many spirits we harbour
our honesty we free spirits let us be careful lest it become our
vanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity
every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue stupid
to the point of sanctity they say in russia let us be careful lest
out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores is not life
a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves one would have to
228 i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy
hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific
appliances and that virtue in my opinion has been more injured
by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else at the same
time however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness it
is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals
and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day
become interesting but let us not be afraid things still remain today
as they have always been i see no one in europe who has or discloses
an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be
conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring manner that calamity
might be involved therein observe for example the indefatigable
inevitable english utilitarians how ponderously and respectably they
stalk on stalk along a homeric metaphor expresses it better in the
footsteps of bentham just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of
the respectable helvetius no he was not a dangerous man helvetius
ce senateur pococurante to use an expression of galiani no new
thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression
of an old thought not even a proper history of what has been previously
thought on the subject an impossible literature taking it all in all
unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief in effect the
old english vice called cant which is moral tartuffism has insinuated
itself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with an
eye to their motives if one must read them concealed this time under
the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent
from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience from which a
race of former puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientific
tinkering with morals is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan
that is to say as a thinker who regards morality as questionable
as worthy of interrogation in short as a problem is moralizing
not immoral in the end they all want english morality to be
recognized as authoritative inasmuch as mankind or the general
utility or the happiness of the greatest number no the happiness
of england will be best served thereby they would like by all means
to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness i
mean after comfort and fashion and in the highest instance a seat in
parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that
in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto it has
just consisted in such striving not one of those ponderous
conscience stricken herding animals who undertake to advocate the
cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare wants to have
any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is
no ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only a
nostrum that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another
that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to
higher men in short that there is a distinction of rank between man
and man and consequently between morality and morality they are an
unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men these utilitarian
englishmen and as already remarked in so far as they are tedious one
cannot think highly enough of their utility one ought even to encourage
them as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes
229 in these later ages which may be proud of their humanity there
still remains so much fear so much superstition of the fear of the
cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of
these humaner ages that even obvious truths as if by the agreement
of centuries have long remained unuttered because they have the
appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again
i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape let
others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment
