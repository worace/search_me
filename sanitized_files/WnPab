prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and
perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considering this information
do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five
years if he goes on like this presently he added thats what we
fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich
her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the
well known prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the
late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever
but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a
brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an
aide de camp of kutuzovs and will be here tonight
listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna pavlovnas
hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for
me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe with an f as a
village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good
and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the
maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as
he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction
attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak to lise young
bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be
arranged it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my
anna pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling the highest
petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged
prince vasilis daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father
to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge
as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya known as la
femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg  was also there she had been
married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any
large gatherings but only to small receptions prince vasilis son
hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio
to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt
or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a
little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come
sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and
slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna
mentioned each ones name and then left them
each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them
cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words about their health and her own and the health of her
majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though
politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a
sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return
the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold
embroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate
dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it
lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her
upper lip and her half open mouth seemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and
carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a
little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life
and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a
the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying
steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work
said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present
mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she
added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a
small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread
out her arms to show her short waisted lace trimmed dainty gray dress
girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast
soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else
you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going
to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she
added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene
what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to
one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with
close cropped hair spectacles the light colored breeches fashionable
at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout
young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a well known
grandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his
first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of
this lowest grade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight
of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face
when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than
the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the
clever though shy but observant and natural expression which
distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room
it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor
invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as
if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance
anna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys health anna
pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe
yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very
you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get
away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a
reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had
finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who
wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart
he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimerical
we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the
foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her
drawing room approaching now a silent now a too noisy group and by a
word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady
proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about
pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe
pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna pavlovnas
was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the
intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child
in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any
clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the self confident and
refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting
to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the
conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity
to express his own views as young people are fond of doing
anna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the aunt
beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had
settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed round the
abbe another of young people was grouped round the beautiful princess
helene prince vasilis daughter and the little princess bolkonskaya
very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age the third
group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovna
the vicomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and polished
manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a
treat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a specially
choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the
kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served up to her
guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choice
morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghien had
perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons
ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovna with a
pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in the sound of
the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to
the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to one of
the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to another
how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third and
the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most
advantageous style like a well garnished joint of roast beef on a hot
the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile
come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to the beautiful
young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another
the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly beautiful
woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and
ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling
diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not looking
at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the
privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back
and bosom which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed
and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved
toward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not only did she not
show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of
her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she seemed to wish
but to be unable to diminish its effect
how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly
the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story was
being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm
altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more
beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsed
the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene
wait a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinking
of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag
there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she
prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her
le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to
his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this
resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like his
sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous self
satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was
dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self
confidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose and mouth
all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and
its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside the
princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this
why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging his
because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone which
showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had
he spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in a
dark green dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings
the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then current
to the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris to visit
mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte who also
enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence napoleon
happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject
and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him and this
the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where
the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked
charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her
work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to the
rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about
the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young
mans simple minded eagerness was explaining his pet theory both were
talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why anna
the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of the
people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for one powerful
nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to place herself
disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the
maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save the
but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning
at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at pierre
asked the italian how he stood russian climate the italians face
instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary
expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women
i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society more especially of the feminine society in which i have had
the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think of
not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the more
conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the
just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew
bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young
man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about
him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was
evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had
found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to
bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from her
with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna pavlovnas
hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company
you are off to the war prince said anna pavlovna
general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the
last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has been pleased
to take me as an aide de camp
are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife
andre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish
manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us
such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte
prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from the
moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad
affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round
prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him an
there now so you too are in the great world said he to pierre
i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with
you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte
no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierres
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished to
say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter
got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass
you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchman
holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising
this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure
and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your
enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna
his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous
in passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna pavlovna
educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and
this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so
necessary for a young man as the society of clever women
anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his
father to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who had
been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili
in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had
left her kindly and tear worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
how about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the
anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i
although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the
elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go
what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would
be transferred to the guards at once said she
believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince
vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise
you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the
the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the
best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to
petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it
was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an
invitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to the
vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she
smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightly
listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for
anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my
fathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake to do
this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor she
added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn
and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said
trying to smile though tears were in her eyes
papa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautiful
head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood
influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized that
if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable
to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in
princess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appeal something
like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true
he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career
moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women
mostly mothers who having once made up their minds will not rest
until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on
insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes
my dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask
but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your fathers memory
i will do the impossible your son shall be transferred to the guards
here is my hand on it are you satisfied
my dear benefactor this is what i expected from you i knew your
wait just a word when he has been transferred to the guards she
faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov
recommend boris to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and
no i wont promise that you dont know how kutuzov is pestered since
his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the
moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants
no but do promise i wont let you go my dear benefactor
papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we
well au revoir good bye you hear her
then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor
do promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he went
with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came
naturally to her but was now very ill suited to her careworn face
apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all
the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to
listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was
and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan
asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca
laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur
buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
nations adorable it is enough to make ones head whirl it is as if
prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic
dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche  they say he was very fine
when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio
mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi
 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware
i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything
the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but
hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii
for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more
animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal
of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors
and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position
prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde
coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity
as if she had asked him to do it
baton de gueules engrele de gueules dazur maison conde said he
if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the
vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he
is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far
by intrigues violence exile and executions french society i mean
good french society will have been forever destroyed and then
he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to
make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna
the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always
accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared
that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their
own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper
the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its
rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist
that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will
be difficult to return to the old regime
from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the
conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real
bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile
it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him though without looking at him
i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince
andrew continued after a short silence again quoting napoleons words
i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far
not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc
even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some
people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation
of the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and
though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she
the execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierre was a
political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness
of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
dieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper
what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her
capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee
the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his
i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from
the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good
he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life
wont you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna
but pierre continued his speech without heeding her
no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because
he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all
that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and
of the press and only for that reason did he obtain power
yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit
murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him
he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid
them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the
revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by
this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his
wish to express all that was in his mind
what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but
wont you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna
rousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile
i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas
yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an
those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important
what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices
and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained
liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last
deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were
high sounding words which have long been discredited who does not love
liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality
have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we
prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of
pierres outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience was
horror struck but when she saw that pierres sacrilegious words had not
exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact
of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is innocent
i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the
18th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at
all like the conduct of a great man
and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the
hes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte
pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his
smile was unlike the half smile of other people when he smiled his
grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another
a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask
the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this
young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were
how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew
besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between
his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it
yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this
one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was
great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plague stricken but but there are other acts
prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend
and asking them all to be seated began
i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it
excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be
lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia
everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must
have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her
taste and she had a ladys maid also big she said
here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with
she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery
get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls
here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several
persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however
she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and
went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew
and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told
it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the
others appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending
pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the
conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and
next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and
having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began
pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge
red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absent
minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals
three cornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general
asked him to restore it all his absent mindedness and inability to
enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly
simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and with
a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion
nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will
when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody
saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are
opinions but you see what a capital good natured fellow i am and
prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to
the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened
indifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also
come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant
princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass
go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess
taking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a low
anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she
contemplated between anatole and the little princess sister in law
i rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone write
to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir
prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face
two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a
cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the
french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual
i am very glad i did not go to the ambassadors said prince hippolyte
 so dull  it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful
they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up
her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there
not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte
smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even
pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from
awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as
still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her
husband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he
are you ready he asked his wife looking past her
prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch
following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage
princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as
the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark
carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under
allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable
tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path
i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and
the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside
hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice
indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte
do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs
continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who
hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were
saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to
pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study like one
quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesars
commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle
what have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now said
prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands
pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager
face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand
that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not
know how to express it not by a balance of political power
it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract
one cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at
last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence
pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him
really i dont yet know i dont like either the one or the other
but you must decide on something your father expects it
pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and
had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his
father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to
petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to
anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write to
me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already
been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on
anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking
but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had
that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us
talk business have you been to the horse guards
no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to
tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for
freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army
but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is
prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierres childish words he
put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense
but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than
the one prince andrew gave to this naive question
if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars
very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about
well why are you going to the war asked pierre
what for i dont know i must besides that i am going he paused
i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me
the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince andrew
shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had
in anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa
the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress as
fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed a
how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and
fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how
stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so
but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are
and i am still arguing with your husband i cant understand why he
wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with
none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
the princess started evidently pierres words touched her to the quick
ah that is just what i tell him said she i dont understand it i
dont in the least understand why men cant live without wars how is it
that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it now you
shall judge between us i always tell him here he is uncles aide de
camp a most brilliant position he is so well known so much
appreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady
asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed
he is so well received everywhere he might easily become aide de camp
to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously
annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think
pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the
oh dont speak of his going dont i wont hear it spoken of said
the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken
to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill suited to
the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i
remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off
and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband
im afraid im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her
her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of
what is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said he
there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim of
his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in
