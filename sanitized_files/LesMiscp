cosette took both the old mans hands in hers
my god said she your hands are still colder than before are you
i no replied jean valjean i am very well only   
yes but that is nothing said jean valjean
cosette thou wert talking to me go on so thy little robin red breast
is dead speak so that i may hear thy voice
marius gazed at the old man in amazement
father my father you will live you are going to live i insist upon
jean valjean raised his head towards her with adoration
oh yes forbid me to die who knows perhaps i shall obey i was on
the verge of dying when you came that stopped me it seemed to me that
you are full of strength and life cried marius do you imagine that
a person can die like this you have had sorrow you shall have no more
it is i who ask your forgiveness and on my knees you are going to
live and to live with us and to live a long time we take possession
of you once more there are two of us here who will henceforth have no
you see resumed cosette all bathed in tears that marius says that
even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pontmercy would
that make me other than i am no god has thought like you and myself
and he does not change his mind it is useful for me to go death is
a good arrangement god knows better than we what we need may you be
happy may monsieur pontmercy have cosette may youth wed the morning
may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your
life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill
your souls and now let me who am good for nothing die it is certain
that all this is right come be reasonable nothing is possible now i
am fully conscious that all is over and then last night i drank that
whole jug of water how good thy husband is cosette thou art much
good day and farewell doctor said jean valjean here are my poor
marius stepped up to the doctor he addressed to him only this single
word monsieur    but his manner of pronouncing it contained a
the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance
because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no
jean valjean turned to cosette he began to gaze at her as though he
in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy
was still possible to him when gazing at cosette the reflection of that
ah it was you that he wanted he murmured looking at cosette and
and bending down to marius ear he added in a very low voice
jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without
these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth
it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live
all at once he rose to his feet these accesses of strength are
sometimes the sign of the death agony he walked with a firm step to
the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him
detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended
there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of
perfect health and said in a loud voice as he laid the crucifix on the
then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of
his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into
cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him
among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies
father do not leave us is it possible that we have found you only to
it might be said that agony writhes it goes comes advances towards
the sepulchre and returns towards life there is groping in the action
jean valjean rallied after this semi swoon shook his brow as though
to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid
he took a fold of cosettes sleeve and kissed it
he is coming back doctor he is coming back cried marius
you are good both of you said jean valjean i am going to tell you
what has caused me pain what has pained me monsieur pontmercy is that
you have not been willing to touch that money that money really belongs
to your wife i will explain to you my children and for that reason
also i am glad to see you black jet comes from england white jet
comes from norway all this is in this paper which you will read for
bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet
iron slides of iron laid together it is prettier better and less
costly you will understand how much money can be made in that way so
cosettes fortune is really hers i give you these details in order
that your mind may be set at rest
the portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half open door
but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying
man before she disappeared would you like a priest
and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where
one would have said that he saw some one
it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death
cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins
have no fear monsieur pontmercy i adjure you the six hundred
thousand francs really belong to cosette my life will have been wasted
if you do not enjoy them we managed to do very well with those glass
goods we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery however we could
not equal the black glass of england a gross which contains twelve
hundred very well cut grains only costs three francs
when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon
him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain
cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not
knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing
jean valjean sank moment by moment he was failing he was drawing near
his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted it
he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all
movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness
of body increased all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread
over his brow the light of the unknown world was already visible in his
his face paled and smiled life was no longer there it was something
his breath sank his glance grew grander he was a corpse on which the
he made a sign to cosette to draw near then to marius the last minute
he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come
from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between
draw near draw near both of you i love you dearly oh how good it
is to die like this and thou lovest me also my cosette i knew well
that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man how kind it was
of thee to place that pillow under my loins thou wilt weep for me a
little wilt thou not not too much i do not wish thee to have any real
griefs you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children i forgot
to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without
tongues than on all the rest a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs
and sold for sixty it really was a good business so there is no
occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur
pontmercy it is honest money you may be rich with a tranquil mind
thou must have a carriage a box at the theatres now and then and
handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners
to thy friends and be very happy i was writing to cosette a while ago
she will find my letter i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which
stand on the chimney piece they are of silver but to me they are gold
they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into
wax tapers i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is
pleased with me yonder on high i have done what i could my children
you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the
first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot this
is my wish no name on the stone if cosette cares to come for a little
while now and then it will give me pleasure and you too monsieur
pontmercy i must admit that i have not always loved you i ask your
pardon for that now she and you form but one for me i feel very
grateful to you i am sure that you make cosette happy if you only
knew monsieur pontmercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i
saw her in the least pale i was sad in the chest of drawers there is
a bank bill for five hundred francs i have not touched it it is for
the poor cosette dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed dost
thou recognize it that was ten years ago however how time flies we
have been very happy all is over do not weep my children i am not
going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to
look at night and you will see me smile cosette dost thou remember
montfermeil thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost
thou remember how i took hold of the handle of the water bucket that
was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand it was so cold
ah your hands were red then mademoiselle they are very white now and
the big doll dost thou remember thou didst call her catherine thou
regrettedest not having taken her to the convent how thou didst make
me laugh sometimes my sweet angel when it had been raining thou didst
float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away one day
i gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and
green feathers thou hast forgotten it thou wert roguish so young thou
didst play thou didst put cherries in thy ears those are things of
the past the forests through which one has passed with ones child the
trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed
oneself the games the hearty laughs of childhood are shadows i
imagined that all that belonged to me in that lay my stupidity those
thenardiers were wicked thou must forgive them cosette the moment
has come to tell thee the name of thy mother she was called fantine
remember that name fantine kneel whenever thou utterest it she
suffered much she loved thee dearly she had as much unhappiness as
thou hast had happiness that is the way god apportions things he is
there on high he sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of
his great stars i am on the verge of departure my children love each
other well and always there is nothing else but that in the world love
for each other you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died
here oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen
thee all this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner
of the street i must have produced a queer effect on the people who
saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat i no
longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but
never mind think a little of me come still nearer i die happy give
me your dear and well beloved heads so that i may lay my hands upon
cosette and marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with
tears each beneath one of jean valjeans hands those august hands no
he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him
his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to
the night was starless and extremely dark no doubt in the gloom some
immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul
chapter vi the grass covers and the rain effaces
in the cemetery of pere lachaise in the vicinity of the common grave
far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres far from all
the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the
hideous fashions of death in a deserted corner beside an old wall
beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus amid
dandelions and mosses there lies a stone that stone is no more exempt
than others from the leprosy of time of dampness of the lichens and
from the defilement of the birds the water turns it green the air
blackens it it is not near any path and people are not fond of
walking in that direction because the grass is high and their feet
are immediately wet when there is a little sunshine the lizards
come thither all around there is a quivering of weeds in the spring
this stone is perfectly plain in cutting it the only thought was the
requirements of the tomb and no other care was taken than to make the
stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man
only many years ago a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines
which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust and

publisher of the italian translation of les miserables in milan
you are right sir when you tell me that les miserables is written for
all nations i do not know whether it will be read by all but i wrote
it for all it is addressed to england as well as to spain to italy as
well as to france to germany as well as to ireland to republics which
have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs social problems
overstep frontiers the sores of the human race those great sores which
cover the globe do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the
map in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place
where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of
the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm
him the book of les miserables knocks at the door and says open to
at the hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which
is still so sombre the miserables name is man he is agonizing in all
climes and he is groaning in all languages
your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france your
admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it does not banditism
that raging form of pauperism inhabit your mountains few nations are
more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which i have endeavored to
fathom in spite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin
florence sienna pisa mantua bologna ferrara genoa venice a
heroic history sublime ruins magnificent ruins and superb cities
you are like ourselves poor you are covered with marvels and vermin
assuredly the sun of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky
like us you have prejudices superstitions tyrannies fanaticisms
blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs you taste nothing of
the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled
with it you have a barbarian the monk and a savage the lazzarone
the social question is the same for you as for us there are a few less
deaths from hunger with you and a few more from fever your social
hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in
england are catholic in italy but under different names the vescovo
is identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty
nearly the same quality to explain the bible badly amounts to the same
is it necessary to emphasize this must this melancholy parallelism
be yet more completely verified have you not indigent persons glance
below have you not parasites glance up does not that hideous balance
whose two scales pauperism and parasitism so mournfully preserve their
mutual equilibrium oscillate before you as it does before us where
is your army of schoolmasters the only army which civilization
where are your free and compulsory schools does every one know how to
read in the land of dante and of michael angelo have you made public
schools of your barracks have you not like ourselves an opulent
war budget and a paltry budget of education have not you also that
passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience
military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of
firing upon garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy
let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it
stands and as it stands let us view its flagrant offences show me the
woman and the child it is by the amount of protection with which these
two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization
is to be measured is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in
paris what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what
amount of justice springs from your tribunals do you chance to be so
fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words public
prosecution legal infamy prison the scaffold the executioner the
death penalty italians with you as with us beccaria is dead and
farinace is alive and then let us scrutinize your state reasons
have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and
politics you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes
something very similar has been done in france stay let us pass
miseries in review let each one contribute his pile you are as rich
as we have you not like ourselves two condemnations religious
condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed
by the judge oh great nation of italy thou resemblest the great
nation of france alas our brothers you are like ourselves
from the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much more
distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of eden only the
priests are mistaken these holy portals are before and not behind us
i resume this book les miserables is no less your mirror than ours
certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book i
understand that mirrors those revealers of the truth are hated that
does not prevent them from being of use
as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own
country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other
nation in proportion as i advance in life i grow more simple and i
this is moreover the tendency of our age and the law of radiance
of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french
italian german spanish or english and become european i say more
human if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization
hence a new logic of art and of certain requirements of composition
which modify everything even the conditions formerly narrow of taste
and language which must grow broader like all the rest
in france certain critics have reproached me to my great delight
with having transgressed the bounds of what they call french taste i
should be glad if this eulogium were merited
in short i am doing what i can i suffer with the same universal
suffering and i try to assuage it i possess only the puny forces of a
man and i cry to all help me
this sir is what your letter prompts me to say i say it for you and
for your country if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one
there are italians and they are numerous who say this book les
miserables is a french book it does not concern us let the french
read it as a history we read it as a romance alas i repeat
whether we be italians or frenchmen misery concerns us all ever since
history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery
has been the garment of the human race the moment has at length arrived
for tearing off that rag and for replacing upon the naked limbs of the
man people the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe
if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and
in dissipating some prejudices you are at liberty to publish it
sir accept i pray you a renewed assurance of my very distinguished

goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me i obeyed thee thou
didst submit to me oh gilded garret to lace thee to behold thee going

ancient mirror and who then would forego the memory of those days of
aurora and the firmament of flowers of gauze and of moire when love
stammers a charming slang our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips
