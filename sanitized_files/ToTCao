for me a parting blessing for our child
i send it to her by you i kiss her by you i say farewell to her by
my husband no a moment he was tearing himself apart from her
we shall not be separated long i feel that this will break my heart
by and bye but i will do my duty while i can and when i leave her god
will raise up friends for her as he did for me
her father had followed her and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them but that darnay put out a hand and seized him crying
no no what have you done what have you done that you should kneel
to us we know now what a struggle you made of old we know now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent and when you knew it we
know now the natural antipathy you strove against and conquered for
her dear sake we thank you with all our hearts and all our love and
her fathers only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair
and wring them with a shriek of anguish
it could not be otherwise said the prisoner all things have worked
together as they have fallen out it was the always vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you good could never come of such evil a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning be comforted and forgive me heaven
as he was drawn away his wife released him and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer and
with a radiant look upon her face in which there was even a comforting
smile as he went out at the prisoners door she turned laid her head
lovingly on her fathers breast tried to speak to him and fell at his
then issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved
sydney carton came and took her up only her father and mr lorry were
with her his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her head
yet there was an air about him that was not all of pity that had a
shall i take her to a coach i shall never feel her weight
he carried her lightly to the door and laid her tenderly down in a
coach her father and their old friend got into it and he took his seat
when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden he lifted her again and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms there he laid her down on a couch where
her child and miss pross wept over her
dont recall her to herself he said softly to the latter she is
better so dont revive her to consciousness while she only faints
oh carton carton dear carton cried little lucie springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him in a burst of grief now that
you have come i think you will do something to help mamma something to
save papa o look at her dear carton can you of all the people who
he bent over the child and laid her blooming cheek against his face he
put her gently from him and looked at her unconscious mother
before i go he said and paused i may kiss her
it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips he murmured some words the child who was nearest to
him told them afterwards and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady that she heard him say a life you love
when he had gone out into the next room he turned suddenly on mr lorry
and her father who were following and said to the latter
you had great influence but yesterday doctor manette let it at least
be tried these judges and all the men in power are very friendly to
you and very recognisant of your services are they not
nothing connected with charles was concealed from me i had the
strongest assurances that i should save him and i did he returned the
try them again the hours between this and to morrow afternoon are few
i intend to try i will not rest a moment
thats well i have known such energy as yours do great things before
now though never he added with a smile and a sigh together such
great things as this but try of little worth as life is when we misuse
it it is worth that effort it would cost nothing to lay down if it
i will go said doctor manette to the prosecutor and the president
straight and i will go to others whom it is better not to name i will
write too and but stay there is a celebration in the streets and no
thats true well it is a forlorn hope at the best and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark i should like to know how you
speed though mind i expect nothing when are you likely to have seen
immediately after dark i should hope within an hour or two from
it will be dark soon after four let us stretch the hour or two if i
go to mr lorrys at nine shall i hear what you have done either from
mr lorry followed sydney to the outer door and touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away caused him to turn
i have no hope said mr lorry in a low and sorrowful whisper
if any one of these men or all of these men were disposed to spare
him which is a large supposition for what is his life or any mans
to them i doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
and so do i i heard the fall of the axe in that sound
mr lorry leaned his arm upon the door post and bowed his face upon it
dont despond said carton very gently dont grieve i encouraged
doctor manette in this idea because i felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her otherwise she might think his life was wantonly
thrown away or wasted and that might trouble her
yes yes yes returned mr lorry drying his eyes you are right
but he will perish there is no real hope
yes he will perish there is no real hope echoed carton
and walked with a settled step down stairs
sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go at
tellsons banking house at nine he said with a musing face shall i
do well in the mean time to show myself i think so it is best that
these people should know there is such a man as i here it is a sound
precaution and may be a necessary preparation but care care care
checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences his first impression was
confirmed it is best he said finally resolved that these people
should know there is such a man as i here and he turned his face
defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wine shop in
the saint antoine suburb it was not difficult for one who knew the city
well to find his house without asking any question having ascertained
its situation carton came out of those closer streets again and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner for the
first time in many years he had no strong drink since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on mr lorrys hearth like a man who had
it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and went out
into the streets again as he passed along towards saint antoine he
stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat and his coat collar and
his wild hair this done he went on direct to defarges and went in
there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice this man whom he had seen upon
the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the
defarges man and wife the vengeance assisted in the conversation like
as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent
french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced
to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered
english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark
after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him he answered in his former strong foreign
madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he
took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde
defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening
oh good evening citizen filling his glass ah and good wine i
defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like
madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like jacques three
pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind see you madame
the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faith and you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slow
forefinger and with a studious and absorbed face they were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together speaking low after a silence
of a few moments during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor they resumed
it is true what madame says observed jacques three why stop there
well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere after all
magnificent croaked jacques three the vengeance also highly
extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather
troubled in general i say nothing against it but this doctor has
suffered much you have seen him to day you have observed his face when
i have observed his face repeated madame contemptuously and angrily
yes i have observed his face i have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the republic let him take care of his face
and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner
the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him
i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i have observed
his daughter more times than one i have observed her to day and i
have observed her other days i have observed her in the court and
i have observed her in the street by the prison let me but lift my
finger  she seemed to raise it the listeners eyes were always on
his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her as
she is an angel said the vengeance and embraced her
as to thee pursued madame implacably addressing her husband if it
depended on thee which happily it does not thou wouldst rescue this
no protested defarge not if to lift this glass would do it but i
would leave the matter there i say stop there
see you then jacques said madame defarge wrathfully and see you
too my little vengeance see you both listen for other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on my register
doomed to destruction and extermination ask my husband is that so
it is so assented defarge without being asked
in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls he finds
this paper of to day and he brings it home and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut we read it here on this spot
by the light of this lamp ask him is that so
that night i tell him when the paper is read through and the lamp is
burnt out and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars that i have now a secret to communicate ask him is
i communicate to him that secret i smite this bosom with these two
hands as i smite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea shore and that peasant family so injured
by the two evremonde brothers as that bastille paper describes is my
family defarge that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister that husband was my sisters husband that unborn child
was their child that brother was my brother that father was my father
those dead are my dead and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me ask him is that so
then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame but dont
both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath the listener could feel how white she was without seeing
her and both highly commended it defarge a weak minority interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply tell
the wind and the fire where to stop not me
customers entered and the group was broken up the english customer
paid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and asked as
a stranger to be directed towards the national palace madame defarge
took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road
the english customer was not without his reflections then that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm lift it and strike under it sharp and
but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present
himself in mr lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety he said he had been with lucie
until just now and had only left her for a few minutes to come and
keep his appointment her father had not been seen since he quitted the
banking house towards four oclock she had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save charles but they were very slight he had been
more than five hours gone where could he be
mr lorry waited until ten but doctor manette not returning and
he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged that he
should go back to her and come to the banking house again at midnight
in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor
he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve but doctor manette
did not come back mr lorry returned and found no tidings of him and
they were discussing this question and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard him on
the stairs the instant he entered the room it was plain that all was
whether he had really been to any one or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets was never known as he stood staring at
them they asked him no question for his face told them everything
i cannot find it said he and i must have it where is it
his head and throat were bare and as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on the floor
where is my bench i have been looking everywhere for my bench and i
cant find it what have they done with my work time presses i must
they looked at one another and their hearts died within them
come come said he in a whimpering miserable way let me get to
receiving no answer he tore his hair and beat his feet upon the
dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with a dreadful
cry but give me my work what is to become of us if those shoes are
it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try to restore him
that as if by agreement they each put a hand upon his shoulder and
soothed him to sit down before the fire with a promise that he should
have his work presently he sank into the chair and brooded over the
embers and shed tears as if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy or a dream mr lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping
affected and impressed with terror as they both were by this spectacle
of ruin it was not a time to yield to such emotions his lonely
daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed to them both
too strongly again as if by agreement they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces carton was the first to speak
the last chance is gone it was not much yes he had better be taken
to her but before you go will you for a moment steadily attend to
me dont ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make and
exact the promise i am going to exact i have a reason a good one
i do not doubt it answered mr lorry say on
the figure in the chair between them was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro and moaning they spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick bed in the
carton stooped to pick up the coat which lay almost entangling his
feet as he did so a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on the floor carton
took it up and there was a folded paper in it we should look
at this he said mr lorry nodded his consent he opened it and
a moment let me speak of it in its place first he put his hand in
his coat and took another paper from it that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city look at it you see sydney carton
mr lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face
keep it for me until to morrow i shall see him to morrow you
remember and i had better not take it into the prison
i dont know i prefer not to do so now take this paper that doctor
manette has carried about him it is a similar certificate enabling him
and his daughter and her child at any time to pass the barrier and the
perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil
yesterday when is it dated but no matter dont stay to look put it
up carefully with mine and your own now observe i never doubted until
within this hour or two that he had or could have such a paper it is
good until recalled but it may be soon recalled and i have reason to
they are in great danger they are in danger of denunciation by madame
defarge i know it from her own lips i have overheard words of that
womans to night which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours i have lost no time and since then i have seen the spy he
confirms me he knows that a wood sawyer living by the prison wall
is under the control of the defarges and has been rehearsed by
madame defarge as to his having seen her he never mentioned lucies
name making signs and signals to prisoners it is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one a prison plot and that it will
involve her life and perhaps her childs and perhaps her fathers for
both have been seen with her at that place dont look so horrified you
i am going to tell you how it will depend on you and it could depend
on no better man this new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after to morrow probably not until two or three days afterwards
more probably a week afterwards you know it is a capital crime to
mourn for or sympathise with a victim of the guillotine she and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime and this woman the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described would wait to add that
strength to her case and make herself doubly sure you follow me
so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say that for
the moment i lose sight touching the back of the doctors chair even
you have money and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made your preparations have been
completed for some days to return to england early to morrow have your
horses ready so that they may be in starting trim at two oclock in the
his manner was so fervent and inspiring that mr lorry caught the
you are a noble heart did i say we could depend upon no better man
tell her to night what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father dwell upon that for she would lay her own fair head
beside her husbands cheerfully he faltered for an instant then went
on as before for the sake of her child and her father press upon her
the necessity of leaving paris with them and you at that hour tell
her that it was her husbands last arrangement tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe or hope you think that her
father even in this sad state will submit himself to her do you not
i thought so quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage
the moment i come to you take me in and drive away
i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances
you have my certificate in your hand with the rest you know and will
reserve my place wait for nothing but to have my place occupied and
why then said mr lorry grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand it does not all depend on one old man but i shall have a young
by the help of heaven you shall promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
remember these words to morrow change the course or delay in it for
any reason and no life can possibly be saved and many lives must
i will remember them i hope to do my part faithfully
and i hope to do mine now good bye
though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness and though he even
put the old mans hand to his lips he did not part from him then he
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it outwatched the awful night he entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone looking up at the light in the window of
her room before he went away he breathed a blessing towards it and a
in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the day awaited
their fate they were in number as the weeks of the year fifty two were
to roll that afternoon on the life tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea before their cells were quit of them new occupants
were appointed before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to morrow was already set
two score and twelve were told off from the farmer general of seventy
whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress of twenty whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her physical diseases engendered
in the vices and neglects of men will seize on victims of all degrees
and the frightful moral disorder born of unspeakable suffering
charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal in every line
of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnation he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and that units could
nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him to compose his mind to what it must bear his hold on life
was strong and it was very very hard to loosen by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched the tighter there and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded
this was closed again there was a hurry too in all his thoughts
a turbulent and heated working of his heart that contended against
resignation if for a moment he did feel resigned then his wife and
child who had to live after him seemed to protest and to make it a
but all this was at first before long the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang up to stimulate
him next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quiet fortitude so
by degrees he calmed into the better state when he could raise his
before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he had
travelled thus far on his last way being allowed to purchase the means
of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time as the
he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had known nothing
of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it from herself
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and uncles
responsibility for that misery until the paper had been read he had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished was the one condition fully intelligible now that
her father had attached to their betrothal and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage he entreated her
for her fathers sake never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper or had had it recalled
to him for the moment or for good by the story of the tower on
that old sunday under the dear old plane tree in the garden if he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there and which had been described to all the world he
besought her though he added that he knew it was needless to console
her father by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing and her overcoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their
dear child he adjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her
to her father himself he wrote in the same strain but he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care and
he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
to mr lorry he commended them all and explained his worldly affairs
that done with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment all was done he never thought of carton his mind was so
full of the others that he never once thought of him
he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out when
he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world
but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shining
forms free and happy back in the old house in soho though it had
nothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and light of
heart he was with lucie again and she told him it was all a dream and
he had never gone away a pause of forgetfulness and then he had even
suffered and had come back to her dead and at peace and yet there
was no difference in him another pause of oblivion and he awoke in the
sombre morning unconscious where he was or what had happened until it
flashed upon his mind this is the day of my death
thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fifty two heads
were to fall and now while he was composed and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in his waking
he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life how
high it was from the ground how many steps it had where he would be
stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would be dyed
red which way his face would be turned whether he would be the first
or might be the last these and many similar questions in nowise
directed by his will obtruded themselves over and over again countless
times neither were they connected with fear he was conscious of no
fear rather they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his than his own
the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again nine gone for ever ten gone for
ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away after a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him he had got the better of it he walked up and down softly
repeating their names to himself the worst of the strife was over
he could walk up and down free from distracting fancies praying for
he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets therefore he resolved to keep two
before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able after that time to strengthen others
walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast a very
different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro at la force
he heard one struck away from him without surprise the hour had
measured like most other hours devoutly thankful to heaven for his
recovered self possession he thought there is but another now and
footsteps in the stone passage outside the door he stopped
the key was put in the lock and turned before the door was opened or
as it opened a man said in a low voice in english he has never seen
me here i have kept out of his way go you in alone i wait near lose
the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before him
face to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on his
features and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton
there was something so bright and remarkable in his look that for the
first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining but he spoke and it was his voice he took the prisoners
of all the people upon earth you least expected to see me he said
i could not believe it to be you i can scarcely believe it now you
are not the apprehension came suddenly into his mind a prisoner
no i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here and in virtue of it i stand before you i come from her your
a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that you well
you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means i have
no time to tell you you must comply with it take off those boots you
there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisoner
carton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightning got
him down into it and stood over him barefoot
draw on these boots of mine put your hands to them put your will to
carton there is no escaping from this place it never can be done you
will only die with me it is madness
it would be madness if i asked you to escape but do i when i ask you
to pass out at that door tell me it is madness and remain here change
that cravat for this of mine that coat for this of mine while you do
it let me take this ribbon from your hair and shake out your hair like
with wonderful quickness and with a strength both of will and action
that appeared quite supernatural he forced all these changes upon him
the prisoner was like a young child in his hands
carton dear carton it is madness it cannot be accomplished it never
can be done it has been attempted and has always failed i implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine
do i ask you my dear darnay to pass the door when i ask that
refuse there are pen and ink and paper on this table is your hand
steady it again and write what i shall dictate quick friend quick
pressing his hand to his bewildered head darnay sat down at the table
carton with his right hand in his breast stood close beside him
to no one carton still had his hand in his breast
the prisoner looked up at each question carton standing over him with
if you remember said carton dictating the words that passed
between us long ago you will readily comprehend this when you see it
you do remember them i know it is not in your nature to forget them
he was drawing his hand from his breast the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder as he wrote the hand stopped closing upon
i have is that a weapon in your hand
you shall know directly write on there are but a few words more he
dictated again i am thankful that the time has come when i can prove
them that i do so is no subject for regret or grief as he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand slowly and softly
the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he looked about
i am conscious of nothing there can be nothing here take up the pen
as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention as he looked at carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing carton his
hand again in his breast looked steadily at him
the prisoner bent over the paper once more
if it had been otherwise cartons hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down i never should have used the longer opportunity
if it had been otherwise the hand was at the prisoners face i
should but have had so much the more to answer for if it had been
otherwise  carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
cartons hand moved back to his breast no more the prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look but cartons hand was close and firm at his
nostrils and cartons left arm caught him round the waist for a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him but within a minute or so he was stretched insensible on
quickly but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside combed back
his hair and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn then he
softly called enter there come in and the spy presented himself
you see said carton looking up as he kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure putting the paper in the breast is your hazard very
mr carton the spy answered with a timid snap of his fingers my
hazard is not that in the thick of business here if you are true to
dont fear me i will be true to the death
you must be mr carton if the tale of fifty two is to be right being
made right by you in that dress i shall have no fear
have no fear i shall soon be out of the way of harming you and the
rest will soon be far from here please god now get assistance and
him man with whom i have exchanged you go out at the gate by which
i was weak and faint when you brought me in and i am fainter now you
take me out the parting interview has overpowered me such a thing has
happened here often and too often your life is in your own hands
you swear not to betray me said the trembling spy as he paused for a
man man returned carton stamping his foot have i sworn by no
solemn vow already to go through with this that you waste the precious
moments now take him yourself to the courtyard you know of place
him yourself in the carriage show him yourself to mr lorry tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air and to remember my words of
last night and his promise of last night and drive away
the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table resting his
forehead on his hands the spy returned immediately with two men
how then said one of them contemplating the fallen figure so
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
a good patriot said the other could hardly have been more afflicted
they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door and bent to carry it away
the time is short evremonde said the spy in a warning voice
i know it well answered carton be careful of my friend i entreat
come then my children said barsad lift him and come away
the door closed and carton was left alone straining his powers of
listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm there was none keys turned doors clashed
footsteps passed along distant passages no cry was raised or hurry
made that seemed unusual breathing more freely in a little while he
sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two
sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning then
began to be audible several doors were opened in succession and
finally his own a gaoler with a list in his hand looked in merely
saying follow me evremonde and he followed into a large dark room
at a distance it was a dark winter day and what with the shadows
within and what with the shadows without he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound some were
standing some seated some were lamenting and in restless motion
but these were few the great majority were silent and still looking
as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fifty two
were brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace him
as having a knowledge of him it thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery but the man went on a very few moments after that a young
woman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face in which there was

the seat where he had observed her sitting and came to speak to him
citizen evremonde she said touching him with her cold hand i am a
poor little seamstress who was with you in la force
he murmured for answer true i forget what you were accused of
plots though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any is it
likely who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tears
i am not afraid to die citizen evremonde but i have done nothing i

hand i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will give me
as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in
them and then astonishment he pressed the work worn hunger worn young
o you will let me hold your brave hand stranger
hush yes my poor sister to the last
the same shadows that are falling on the prison are falling in that
same hour of the early afternoon on the barrier with the crowd about
it when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined
who goes here whom have we within papers
this is he this helpless inarticulately murmuring wandering old man
apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind the
revolution fever will have been too much for him

something new in thy family remember it sydney carton advocate
he lies here in this corner of the carriage he too is pointed out
apparently the english advocate is in a swoon
it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air it is represented that
he is not in strong health and has separated sadly from a friend who is
is that all it is not a great deal that many are under the
displeasure of the republic and must look out at the little window
it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions it
is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door replying to a group of officials they leisurely walk round the
