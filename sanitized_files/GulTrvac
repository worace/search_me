might at another time raise an inundation by the same means to drown
the whole palace and the same strength which enabled you to bring over
the enemys fleet might serve upon the first discontent to carry it
back that he had good reasons to think you were a big endian in your
heart and as treason begins in the heart before it appears in
overt acts so he accused you as a traitor on that account and therefore
the treasurer was of the same opinion he showed to what straits his
majestys revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you which
would soon grow insupportable that the secretarys expedient of putting
out your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this evil that it
would probably increase it as is manifest from the common practice of
blinding some kind of fowls after which they fed the faster and grew
sooner fat that his sacred majesty and the council who are your judges
were in their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt which was
a sufficient argument to condemn you to death without the formal proofs
required by the strict letter of the law
but his imperial majesty fully determined against capital punishment
was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of
your eyes too easy a censure some other way may be inflicted hereafter
and your friend the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again in
answer to what the treasurer had objected concerning the great charge
his majesty was at in maintaining you said that his excellency who had
the sole disposal of the emperors revenue might easily provide against
that evil by gradually lessening your establishment by which for want
of sufficient for you would grow weak and faint and lose your appetite
and consequently decay and consume in a few months neither would the
stench of your carcass be then so dangerous when it should become more
than half diminished and immediately upon your death five or six
thousand of his majestys subjects might in two or three days cut your
flesh from your bones take it away by cart loads and bury it in distant
parts to prevent infection leaving the skeleton as a monument of
thus by the great friendship of the secretary the whole affair was
compromised it was strictly enjoined that the project of starving you
by degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out your
eyes was entered on the books none dissenting except bolgolam the
admiral who being a creature of the empress was perpetually instigated
by her majesty to insist upon your death she having borne perpetual
malice against you on account of that infamous and illegal method you
took to extinguish the fire in her apartment
in three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to your
house and read before you the articles of impeachment and then to
signify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council whereby
you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes which his majesty does
not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to and twenty of his
majestys surgeons will attend in order to see the operation well
performed by discharging very sharp pointed arrows into the balls of
your eyes as you lie on the ground
i leave to your prudence what measures you will take and to avoid
suspicion i must immediately return in as private a manner as i came
his lordship did so and i remained alone under many doubts and
it was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry very
different as i have been assured from the practice of former times
that after the court had decreed any cruel execution either to gratify
the monarchs resentment or the malice of a favourite the emperor
always made a speech to his whole council expressing his great lenity
and tenderness as qualities known and confessed by all the world this
speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom nor did any
thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majestys
mercy because it was observed that the more these praises were enlarged
and insisted on the more inhuman was the punishment and the sufferer
more innocent yet as to myself i must confess having never been
designed for a courtier either by my birth or education i was so ill a
judge of things that i could not discover the lenity and favour of this
sentence but conceived it perhaps erroneously rather to be rigorous
than gentle i sometimes thought of standing my trial for although i
could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles yet i hoped
they would admit of some extenuation but having in my life perused many
state trials which i ever observed to terminate as the judges thought
fit to direct i durst not rely on so dangerous a decision in so
critical a juncture and against such powerful enemies once i was
strongly bent upon resistance for while i had liberty the whole
strength of that empire could hardly subdue me and i might easily with
stones pelt the metropolis to pieces but i soon rejected that project
with horror by remembering the oath i had made to the emperor the
favours i received from him and the high title of nardac he conferred
upon me neither had i so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers to
persuade myself that his majestys present seventies acquitted me of all
at last i fixed upon a resolution for which it is probable i may incur
some censure and not unjustly for i confess i owe the preserving of
mine eyes and consequently my liberty to my own great rashness and want
of experience because if i had then known the nature of princes and
ministers which i have since observed in many other courts and their
methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself i should with
great alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment
but hurried on by the precipitancy of youth and having his imperial
majestys license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of blefuscu i
took this opportunity before the three days were elapsed to send a
letter to my friend the secretary signifying my resolution of setting
out that morning for blefuscu pursuant to the leave i had got and
without waiting for an answer i went to that side of the island where
our fleet lay i seized a large man of war tied a cable to the prow
and lifting up the anchors i stripped myself put my clothes together
with my coverlet which i carried under my arm into the vessel and
drawing it after me between wading and swimming arrived at the royal
port of blefuscu where the people had long expected me they lent me two
guides to direct me to the capital city which is of the same name i
held them in my hands till i came within two hundred yards of the gate
and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries and
let him know i there waited his majestys command i had an answer in
about an hour that his majesty attended by the royal family and great
officers of the court was coming out to receive me i advanced a
hundred yards the emperor and his train alighted from their horses the
empress and ladies from their coaches and i did not perceive they were
in any fright or concern i lay on the ground to kiss his majestys and
the empresss hands i told his majesty that i was come according to
my promise and with the license of the emperor my master to have the
honour of seeing so mighty a monarch and to offer him any service in my
power consistent with my duty to my own prince not mentioning a word
of my disgrace because i had hitherto no regular information of it and
might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design neither could i
reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret while i
was out of his power wherein however it soon appeared i was deceived
i shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my
reception at this court which was suitable to the generosity of so great
a prince nor of the difficulties i was in for want of a house and bed
being forced to lie on the ground wrapped up in my coverlet
the author by a lucky accident finds means to leave blefuscu and
after some difficulties returns safe to his native country
three days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the north east
coast of the island i observed about half a league off in the sea
somewhat that looked like a boat overturned i pulled off my shoes and
stockings and wailing two or three hundred yards i found the object to
approach nearer by force of the tide and then plainly saw it to be a
real boat which i supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a
ship whereupon i returned immediately towards the city and desired
his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had
left after the loss of his fleet and three thousand seamen under the
command of his vice admiral this fleet sailed round while i went back
the shortest way to the coast where i first discovered the boat i
found the tide had driven it still nearer the seamen were all provided
with cordage which i had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength
when the ships came up i stripped myself and waded till i came within a
hundred yards off the boat after which i was forced to swim till i got
up to it the seamen threw me the end of the cord which i fastened to a
hole in the fore part of the boat and the other end to a man of war but
i found all my labour to little purpose for being out of my depth i
was not able to work in this necessity i was forced to swim behind and
push the boat forward as often as i could with one of my hands and the
tide favouring me i advanced so far that i could just hold up my chin
and feel the ground i rested two or three minutes and then gave the
boat another shove and so on till the sea was no higher than my
arm pits and now the most laborious part being over i took out my
other cables which were stowed in one of the ships and fastened them
first to the boat and then to nine of the vessels which attended me the
wind being favourable the seamen towed and i shoved until we arrived
within forty yards of the shore and waiting till the tide was out i
got dry to the boat and by the assistance of two thousand men with
ropes and engines i made a shift to turn it on its bottom and found it
i shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties i was under by the
help of certain paddles which cost me ten days making to get my boat to
the royal port of blefuscu where a mighty concourse of people appeared
upon my arrival full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel
i told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way
to carry me to some place whence i might return into my native country
and begged his majestys orders for getting materials to fit it up
together with his license to depart which after some kind
i did very much wonder in all this time not to have heard of any
express relating to me from our emperor to the court of blefuscu but i
was afterward given privately to understand that his imperial majesty
never imagining i had the least notice of his designs believed i was
only gone to blefuscu in performance of my promise according to the
license he had given me which was well known at our court and would
return in a few days when the ceremony was ended but he was at last in
pain at my long absence and after consulting with the treasurer and the
rest of that cabal a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of
the articles against me this envoy had instructions to represent to the
monarch of blefuscu the great lenity of his master who was content to
punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes that i had fled
from justice and if i did not return in two hours i should be deprived
of my title of nardac and declared a traitor the envoy further
added that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both
empires his master expected that his brother of blefuscu would give
orders to have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to be
the emperor of blefuscu having taken three days to consult returned an
answer consisting of many civilities and excuses he said that as for
sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible that although i
had deprived him of his fleet yet he owed great obligations to me for
many good offices i had done him in making the peace that however
both their majesties would soon be made easy for i had found a
prodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he had
given orders to fit up with my own assistance and direction and he
hoped in a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable
with this answer the envoy returned to lilliput and the monarch of
blefuscu related to me all that had passed offering me at the same time
but under the strictest confidence his gracious protection if i would
continue in his service wherein although i believed him sincere yet i
resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers where
i could possibly avoid it and therefore with all due acknowledgments
for his favourable intentions i humbly begged to be excused i told
him that since fortune whether good or evil had thrown a vessel in my
way i was resolved to venture myself on the ocean rather than be an
occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs neither did i
find the emperor at all displeased and i discovered by a certain
accident that he was very glad of my resolution and so were most of his
these considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than
i intended to which the court impatient to have me gone very readily
contributed five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my
boat according to my directions by quilting thirteen folds of their
strongest linen together i was at the pains of making ropes and cables
by twisting ten twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of
theirs a great stone that i happened to find after a long search by
the sea shore served me for an anchor i had the tallow of three
hundred cows for greasing my boat and other uses i was at incredible
pains in cutting down some of the largest timber trees for oars and
masts wherein i was however much assisted by his majestys
ship carpenters who helped me in smoothing them after i had done the
in about a month when all was prepared i sent to receive his majestys
commands and to take my leave the emperor and royal family came out of
the palace i lay down on my face to kiss his hand which he very
graciously gave me so did the empress and young princes of the blood
his majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs
a piece together with his picture at full length which i put
immediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt the
ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at
i stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen and three hundred
sheep with bread and drink proportionable and as much meat ready
dressed as four hundred cooks could provide i took with me six cows and
two bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them into
my own country and propagate the breed and to feed them on board i
had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn i would gladly have taken a
dozen of the natives but this was a thing the emperor would by no means
permit and besides a diligent search into my pockets his majesty
engaged my honour not to carry away any of his subjects although with
having thus prepared all things as well as i was able i set sail on the
twenty fourth day of september 1701 at six in the morning and when i
had gone about four leagues to the northward the wind being at
south east at six in the evening i descried a small island about half a
league to the north west i advanced forward and cast anchor on the
lee side of the island which seemed to be uninhabited i then took some
refreshment and went to my rest i slept well and as i conjectured at
least six hours for i found the day broke in two hours after i awaked
it was a clear night i ate my breakfast before the sun was up and
heaving anchor the wind being favourable i steered the same course that
i had done the day before wherein i was directed by my pocket compass
my intention was to reach if possible one of those islands which i had
reason to believe lay to the north east of van diemens land i
discovered nothing all that day but upon the next about three in the
afternoon when i had by my computation made twenty four leagues from
blefuscu i descried a sail steering to the south east my course was due
east i hailed her but could get no answer yet i found i gained upon
her for the wind slackened i made all the sail i could and in half an
hour she spied me then hung out her ancient and discharged a gun it
is not easy to express the joy i was in upon the unexpected hope of once
more seeing my beloved country and the dear pledges i left in it the
ship slackened her sails and i came up with her between five and six in
the evening september 26th but my heart leaped within me to see her
english colours i put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets and got
on board with all my little cargo of provisions the vessel was an
english merchantman returning from japan by the north and south seas
the captain mr john biddel of deptford a very civil man and an
we were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south there were about fifty
men in the ship and here i met an old comrade of mine one peter
williams who gave me a good character to the captain this gentleman
treated me with kindness and desired i would let him know what place i
came from last and whither i was bound which i did in a few words but
he thought i was raving and that the dangers i underwent had disturbed
my head whereupon i took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket
which after great astonishment clearly convinced him of my veracity i
then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of blefuscu together
with his majestys picture at full length and some other rarities of
that country i gave him two purses of two hundreds sprugs each and
promised when we arrived in england to make him a present of a cow and
i shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage
which was very prosperous for the most part we arrived in the downs on
the 13th of april 1702 i had only one misfortune that the rats on
board carried away one of my sheep i found her bones in a hole picked
clean from the flesh the rest of my cattle i got safe ashore and set
them a grazing in a bowling green at greenwich where the fineness of the
grass made them feed very heartily though i had always feared the
contrary neither could i possibly have preserved them in so long a
voyage if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit
which rubbed to powder and mingled with water was their constant food
the short time i continued in england i made a considerable profit by
showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others and before i
began my second voyage i sold them for six hundred pounds since my
last return i find the breed is considerably increased especially the
sheep which i hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen
i stayed but two months with my wife and family for my insatiable desire
of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer i
left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and fixed her in a good house
at redriff my remaining stock i carried with me part in money and part
in goods in hopes to improve my fortunes my eldest uncle john had left
me an estate in land near epping of about thirty pounds a year and i
had a long lease of the black bull in fetter lane which yielded me as
much more so that i was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the
parish my son johnny named so after his uncle was at the
grammar school and a towardly child my daughter betty who is now well
married and has children was then at her needle work i took leave of
my wife and boy and girl with tears on both sides and went on board
the adventure a merchant ship of three hundred tons bound for surat
captain john nicholas of liverpool commander but my account of this
voyage must be referred to the second part of my travels
a great storm described the long boat sent to fetch water the author
goes with it to discover the country he is left on shore is seized by
one of the natives and carried to a farmers house his reception with
several accidents that happened there a description of the inhabitants
having been condemned by nature and fortune to active and restless
life in two months after my return i again left my native country and
took shipping in the downs on the 20th day of june 1702 in the
adventure captain john nicholas a cornish man commander bound for
surat we had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at the cape of
good hope where we landed for fresh water but discovering a leak we
unshipped our goods and wintered there for the captain falling sick of
an ague we could not leave the cape till the end of march we then set
sail and had a good voyage till we passed the straits of madagascar but
having got northward of that island and to about five degrees south
latitude the winds which in those seas are observed to blow a constant
equal gale between the north and west from the beginning of december to
the beginning of may on the 19th of april began to blow with much
greater violence and more westerly than usual continuing so for twenty
days together during which time we were driven a little to the east of
the molucca islands and about three degrees northward of the line as
our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of may at which time
the wind ceased and it was a perfect calm whereat i was not a little
rejoiced but he being a man well experienced in the navigation of
those seas bid us all prepare against a storm which accordingly
happened the day following for the southern wind called the southern
finding it was likely to overblow we took in our sprit sail and stood
by to hand the fore sail but making foul weather we looked the guns
were all fast and handed the mizen the ship lay very broad off so we
thought it better spooning before the sea than trying or hulling we
reefed the fore sail and set him and hauled aft the fore sheet the helm
was hard a weather the ship wore bravely we belayed the fore
down haul but the sail was split and we hauled down the yard and got
the sail into the ship and unbound all the things clear of it it was a
very fierce storm the sea broke strange and dangerous we hauled off
upon the laniard of the whip staff and helped the man at the helm we
would not get down our topmast but let all stand because she scudded
before the sea very well and we knew that the top mast being aloft the
ship was the wholesomer and made better way through the sea seeing we
had sea room when the storm was over we set fore sail and main sail
and brought the ship to then we set the mizen main top sail and the
fore top sail our course was east north east the wind was at
south west we got the starboard tacks aboard we cast off our
weather braces and lifts we set in the lee braces and hauled forward by
the weather bowlings and hauled them tight and belayed them and hauled
over the mizen tack to windward and kept her full and by as near as she
during this storm which was followed by a strong wind west south west
we were carried by my computation about five hundred leagues to the
east so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of
the world we were our provisions held out well our ship was staunch
and our crew all in good health but we lay in the utmost distress for
water we thought it best to hold on the same course rather than turn
more northerly which might have brought us to the north west part of
on the 16th day of june 1703 a boy on the top mast discovered land on
the 17th we came in full view of a great island or continent for we
knew not whether on the south side whereof was a small neck of land
jutting out into the sea and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above
one hundred tons we cast anchor within a league of this creek and our
captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long boat with vessels
for water if any could be found i desired his leave to go with them
that i might see the country and make what discoveries i could when we
came to land we saw no river or spring nor any sign of inhabitants our
men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the
sea and i walked alone about a mile on the other side where i observed
the country all barren and rocky i now began to be weary and seeing
nothing to entertain my curiosity i returned gently down towards the
creek and the sea being full in my view i saw our men already got into
the boat and rowing for life to the ship i was going to holla after
them although it had been to little purpose when i observed a huge
creature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could he waded not
much deeper than his knees and took prodigious strides but our men had
the start of him half a league and the sea thereabouts being full of
sharp pointed rocks the monster was not able to overtake the boat this
i was afterwards told for i durst not stay to see the issue of the
adventure but ran as fast as i could the way i first went and then
climbed up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the country i
found it fully cultivated but that which first surprised me was the
length of the grass which in those grounds that seemed to be kept for
i fell into a high road for so i took it to be though it served to the
inhabitants only as a foot path through a field of barley here i walked
on for some time but could see little on either side it being now near
harvest and the corn rising at least forty feet i was an hour walking
to the end of this field which was fenced in with a hedge of at least
one hundred and twenty feet high and the trees so lofty that i could
make no computation of their altitude there was a stile to pass from
this field into the next it had four steps and a stone to cross over
when you came to the uppermost it was impossible for me to climb this
stile because every step was six feet high and the upper stone about
twenty i was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge when i
discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field advancing towards
the stile of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursuing our
boat he appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple and took about
ten yards at every stride as near as i could guess i was struck with
the utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself in the corn
whence i saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field
on the right hand and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than
a speaking trumpet but the noise was so high in the air that at first i
certainly thought it was thunder whereupon seven monsters like
himself came towards him with reaping hooks in their hands each hook
about the largeness of six scythes these people were not so well clad
as the first whose servants or labourers they seemed to be for upon
some words he spoke they went to reap the corn in the field where i lay
i kept from them at as great a distance as i could but was forced to
move with extreme difficulty for the stalks of the corn were sometimes
not above a foot distant so that i could hardly squeeze my body betwixt
them however i made a shift to go forward till i came to a part of
the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind here it was
impossible for me to advance a step for the stalks were so interwoven
that i could not creep through and the beards of the fallen ears so
strong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh
at the same time i heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me
being quite dispirited with toil and wholly overcome by grief and
dispair i lay down between two ridges and heartily wished i might there
end my days i bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children i
lamented my own folly and wilfulness in attempting a second voyage
against the advice of all my friends and relations in this terrible
agitation of mind i could not forbear thinking of lilliput whose
inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in
the world where i was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand and
perform those other actions which will be recorded for ever in the
chronicles of that empire while posterity shall hardly believe them
although attested by millions i reflected what a mortification it must
prove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single
lilliputian would be among us but this i conceived was to be the least
of my misfortunes for as human creatures are observed to be more savage
and cruel in proportion to their bulk what could i expect but to be a
morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that
should happen to seize me undoubtedly philosophers are in the right
when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by
comparison it might have pleased fortune to have let the lilliputians
find some nation where the people were as diminutive with respect to
them as they were to me and who knows but that even this prodigious
race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the
scared and confounded as i was i could not forbear going on with these
reflections when one of the reapers approaching within ten yards of the
ridge where i lay made me apprehend that with the next step i should be
squashed to death under his foot or cut in two with his reaping hook
and therefore when he was again about to move i screamed as loud as
fear could make me whereupon the huge creature trod short and looking
round about under him for some time at last espied me as i lay on the
ground he considered awhile with the caution of one who endeavours to
lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not
be able either to scratch or bite him as i myself have sometimes done
with a weasel in england at length he ventured to take me behind by
the middle between his fore finger and thumb and brought me within
three yards of his eyes that he might behold my shape more perfectly i
guessed his meaning and my good fortune gave me so much presence of
mind that i resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the
air above sixty feet from the ground although he grievously pinched my
sides for fear i should slip through his fingers all i ventured was to
raise mine eyes towards the sun and place my hands together in a
supplicating posture and to speak some words in a humble melancholy
tone suitable to the condition i then was in for i apprehended every
moment that he would dash me against the ground as we usually do any
little hateful animal which we have a mind to destroy but my good star
would have it that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures and
began to look upon me as a curiosity much wondering to hear me pronounce
articulate words although he could not understand them in the mean
time i was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears and turning
my head towards my sides letting him know as well as i could how
cruelly i was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger he seemed to
apprehend my meaning for lifting up the lappet of his coat he put me
gently into it and immediately ran along with me to his master who was
a substantial farmer and the same person i had first seen in the field
the farmer having as i suppose by their talk received such an account
of me as his servant could give him took a piece of a small straw about
the size of a walking staff and therewith lifted up the lappets of my
coat which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature
had given me he blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face
he called his hinds about him and asked them as i afterwards learned
whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that
resembled me he then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours but
i got immediately up and walked slowly backward and forward to let
those people see i had no intent to run away they all sat down in a
circle about me the better to observe my motions i pulled off my hat
and made a low bow towards the farmer i fell on my knees and lifted up
my hands and eyes and spoke several words as loud as i could i took a
purse of gold out of my pocket and humbly presented it to him he
received it on the palm of his hand then applied it close to his eye to
see what it was and afterwards turned it several times with the point of
a pin which he took out of his sleeve but could make nothing of it
whereupon i made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground i
then took the purse and opening it poured all the gold into his palm
there were six spanish pieces of four pistoles each beside twenty or
thirty smaller coins i saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon
his tongue and take up one of my largest pieces and then another but
he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were he made me a sign to put
them again into my purse and the purse again into my pocket which
after offering it to him several times i thought it best to do
the farmer by this time was convinced i must be a rational creature
he spoke often to me but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like
that of a water mill yet his words were articulate enough i answered
as loud as i could in several languages and he often laid his ear within
two yards of me but all in vain for we were wholly unintelligible to
each other he then sent his servants to their work and taking his
handkerchief out of his pocket he doubled and spread it on his left
hand which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward making me
a sign to step into it as i could easily do for it was not above a foot
in thickness i thought it my part to obey and for fear of falling
laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remainder of
which he lapped me up to the head for further security and in this
manner carried me home to his house there he called his wife and
showed me to her but she screamed and ran back as women in england do
at the sight of a toad or a spider however when she had a while seen
my behaviour and how well i observed the signs her husband made she was
soon reconciled and by degrees grew extremely tender of me
it was about twelve at noon and a servant brought in dinner it was
only one substantial dish of meat fit for the plain condition of a
husbandman in a dish of about four and twenty feet diameter the
company were the farmer and his wife three children and an old
grandmother when they were sat down the farmer placed me at some
distance from him on the table which was thirty feet high from the
floor i was in a terrible fright and kept as far as i could from the
edge for fear of falling the wife minced a bit of meat then crumbled
some bread on a trencher and placed it before me i made her a low bow
took out my knife and fork and fell to eat which gave them exceeding
delight the mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup which held
about two gallons and filled it with drink i took up the vessel with
much difficulty in both hands and in a most respectful manner drank to
her ladyships health expressing the words as loud as i could in
english which made the company laugh so heartily that i was almost
deafened with the noise this liquor tasted like a small cider and was
not unpleasant then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher
side but as i walked on the table being in great surprise all the time
as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse i happened to
stumble against a crust and fell flat on my face but received no hurt
i got up immediately and observing the good people to be in much
concern i took my hat which i held under my arm out of good manners
and waving it over my head made three huzzas to show i had got no
mischief by my fall but advancing forward towards my master as i shall
henceforth call him his youngest son who sat next to him an arch boy
of about ten years old took me up by the legs and held me so high in
the air that i trembled every limb but his father snatched me from him
and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear as would have
felled an european troop of horse to the earth ordering him to be taken
from the table but being afraid the boy might owe me a spite and well
remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to
sparrows rabbits young kittens and puppy dogs i fell on my knees and
pointing to the boy made my master to understand as well as i could
that i desired his son might be pardoned the father complied and the
lad took his seat again whereupon i went to him and kissed his hand
which my master took and made him stroke me gently with it
in the midst of dinner my mistresss favourite cat leaped into her lap
i heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking weavers at work
and turning my head i found it proceeded from the purring of that
animal who seemed to be three times larger than an ox as i computed by
the view of her head and one of her paws while her mistress was feeding
and stroking her the fierceness of this creatures countenance
altogether discomposed me though i stood at the farther end of the
table above fifty feet off and although my mistress held her fast for
fear she might give a spring and seize me in her talons but it
happened there was no danger for the cat took not the least notice of me
when my master placed me within three yards of her and as i have been
always told and found true by experience in my travels that flying or
discovering fear before a fierce animal is a certain way to make it
pursue or attack you so i resolved in this dangerous juncture to show
no manner of concern i walked with intrepidity five or six times before
the very head of the cat and came within half a yard of her whereupon
she drew herself back as if she were more afraid of me i had less
apprehension concerning the dogs whereof three or four came into the
room as it is usual in farmers houses one of which was a mastiff
equal in bulk to four elephants and another a greyhound somewhat taller
when dinner was almost done the nurse came in with a child of a year old
in her arms who immediately spied me and began a squall that you might
have heard from london bridge to chelsea after the usual oratory of
infants to get me for a plaything the mother out of pure indulgence
took me up and put me towards the child who presently seized me by the
middle and got my head into his mouth where i roared so loud that the
urchin was frighted and let me drop and i should infallibly have broke
my neck if the mother had not held her apron under me the nurse to
quiet her babe made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel
filled with great stones and fastened by a cable to the childs waist
but all in vain so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by
giving it suck i must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as
the sight of her monstrous breast which i cannot tell what to compare
with so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk shape and
colour it stood prominent six feet and could not be less than sixteen
in circumference the nipple was about half the bigness of my head and
the hue both of that and the dug so varied with spots pimples and
freckles that nothing could appear more nauseous for i had a near sight
of her she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck and i
standing on the table this made me reflect upon the fair skins of our
english ladies who appear so beautiful to us only because they are of
our own size and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying
glass where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins
i remember when i was at lilliput the complexion of those diminutive
people appeared to me the fairest in the world and talking upon this
subject with a person of learning there who was an intimate friend of
mine he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he
looked on me from the ground than it did upon a nearer view when i took
him up in my hand and brought him close which he confessed was at first
a very shocking sight he said he could discover great holes in my
skin that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the
bristles of a boar and my complexion made up of several colours
altogether disagreeable although i must beg leave to say for myself
that i am as fair as most of my sex and country and very little sunburnt
by all my travels on the other side discoursing of the ladies in that
emperors court he used to tell me one had freckles another too wide
a mouth a third too large a nose nothing of which i was able to
distinguish i confess this reflection was obvious enough which
however i could not forbear lest the reader might think those vast
creatures were actually deformed for i must do them the justice to say
they are a comely race of people and particularly the features of my
masters countenance although he was but a farmer when i beheld him
from the height of sixty feet appeared very well proportioned
when dinner was done my master went out to his labourers and as i
could discover by his voice and gesture gave his wife strict charge to
take care of me i was very much tired and disposed to sleep which my
mistress perceiving she put me on her own bed and covered me with a
clean white handkerchief but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a
i slept about two hours and dreamt i was at home with my wife and
children which aggravated my sorrows when i awaked and found myself
alone in a vast room between two and three hundred feet wide and above
two hundred high lying in a bed twenty yards wide my mistress was gone
about her household affairs and had locked me in the bed was eight
yards from the floor some natural necessities required me to get down
i durst not presume to call and if i had it would have been in vain
with such a voice as mine at so great a distance from the room where i
lay to the kitchen where the family kept while i was under these
circumstances two rats crept up the curtains and ran smelling backwards
and forwards on the bed one of them came up almost to my face
whereupon i rose in a fright and drew out my hanger to defend myself
these horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides and
one of them held his fore feet at my collar but i had the good fortune
to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief he fell down at
my feet and the other seeing the fate of his comrade made his escape
but not without one good wound on the back which i gave him as he fled
and made the blood run trickling from him after this exploit i walked
gently to and fro on the bed to recover my breath and loss of spirits
these creatures were of the size of a large mastiff but infinitely more
nimble and fierce so that if i had taken off my belt before i went to
sleep i must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured i
measured the tail of the dead rat and found it to be two yards long
wanting an inch but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off
the bed where it lay still bleeding i observed it had yet some life
but with a strong slash across the neck i thoroughly despatched it
soon after my mistress came into the room who seeing me all bloody ran
and took me up in her hand i pointed to the dead rat smiling and
making other signs to show i was not hurt whereat she was extremely
rejoiced calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs
and throw it out of the window then she set me on a table where i
showed her my hanger all bloody and wiping it on the lappet of my coat
returned it to the scabbard i was pressed to do more than one thing
which another could not do for me and therefore endeavoured to make my
mistress understand that i desired to be set down on the floor which
after she had done my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself
farther than by pointing to the door and bowing several times the
good woman with much difficulty at last perceived what i would be at
and taking me up again in her hand walked into the garden where she set
me down i went on one side about two hundred yards and beckoning to
her not to look or to follow me i hid myself between two leaves of
sorrel and there discharged the necessities of nature
i hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the
like particulars which however insignificant they may appear to
groveling vulgar minds yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge
his thoughts and imagination and apply them to the benefit of public as
well as private life which was my sole design in presenting this and
other accounts of my travels to the world wherein i have been chiefly
studious of truth without affecting any ornaments of learning or of
style but the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression
on my mind and is so deeply fixed in my memory that in committing it
to paper i did not omit one material circumstance however upon a strict
review i blotted out several passages of less moment which were in my
first copy for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling whereof
travellers are often perhaps not without justice accused
a description of the farmers daughter the author carried to a
market town and then to the metropolis the particulars of his journey
my mistress had a daughter of nine years old a child of towardly parts
for her age very dexterous at her needle and skilful in dressing her
baby her mother and she contrived to fit up the babys cradle for me
against night the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet and
the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats this was my
bed all the time i staid with those people though made more convenient
by degrees as i began to learn their language and make my wants known
this young girl was so handy that after i had once or twice pulled off
my clothes before her she was able to dress and undress me though i
never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself she
made me seven shirts and some other linen of as fine cloth as could be
got which indeed was coarser than sackcloth and these she constantly
washed for me with her own hands she was likewise my school mistress
to teach me the language when i pointed to any thing she told me the
name of it in her own tongue so that in a few days i was able to call
for whatever i had a mind to she was very good natured and not above
forty feet high being little for her age she gave me the name of
grildrig which the family took up and afterwards the whole kingdom
the word imports what the latins call nanunculus the italians
homunceletino and the english mannikin to her i chiefly owe my
preservation in that country we never parted while i was there i called
her my glumdalclitch or little nurse and should be guilty of great
ingratitude if i omitted this honourable mention of her care and
affection towards me which i heartily wish it lay in my power to requite
as she deserves instead of being the innocent but unhappy instrument of
her disgrace as i have too much reason to fear
it now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood that my
master had found a strange animal in the field about the bigness of a
splacnuck but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature
which it likewise imitated in all its actions seemed to speak in a
little language of its own had already learned several words of theirs
went erect upon two legs was tame and gentle would come when it was
called do whatever it was bid had the finest limbs in the world and a
complexion fairer than a noblemans daughter of three years old another
farmer who lived hard by and was a particular friend of my master came
on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story i was
immediately produced and placed upon a table where i walked as i was
commanded drew my hanger put it up again made my reverence to my
masters guest asked him in his own language how he did and told him
he was welcome just as my little nurse had instructed me this man
who was old and dim sighted put on his spectacles to behold me better
at which i could not forbear laughing very heartily for his eyes
appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows our
people who discovered the cause of my mirth bore me company in
laughing at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of
countenance he had the character of a great miser and to my
misfortune he well deserved it by the cursed advice he gave my master
to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town which was half
an hours riding about two and twenty miles from our house i guessed
there was some mischief when i observed my master and his friend
whispering together sometimes pointing at me and my fears made me fancy
that i overheard and understood some of their words but the next
morning glumdalclitch my little nurse told me the whole matter which
she had cunningly picked out from her mother the poor girl laid me on
her bosom and fell a weeping with shame and grief she apprehended some
mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks who might squeeze me
to death or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands she had
also observed how modest i was in my nature how nicely i regarded my
honour and what an indignity i should conceive it to be exposed for
money as a public spectacle to the meanest of the people she said her
papa and mamma had promised that grildrig should be hers but now she
found they meant to serve her as they did last year when they pretended
to give her a lamb and yet as soon as it was fat sold it to a butcher
for my own part i may truly affirm that i was less concerned than my
nurse i had a strong hope which never left me that i should one day
recover my liberty and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a
monster i considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country and
that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach if
ever i should return to england since the king of great britain himself
in my condition must have undergone the same distress
my master pursuant to the advice of his friend carried me in a box the
next market day to the neighbouring town and took along with him his
little daughter my nurse upon a pillion behind him the box was close
on every side with a little door for me to go in and out and a few
gimlet holes to let in air the girl had been so careful as to put the
quilt of her babys bed into it for me to lie down on however i was
terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey though it was but of
half an hour for the horse went about forty feet at every step and
trotted so high that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling
of a ship in a great storm but much more frequent our journey was
somewhat farther than from london to st albans my master alighted at
an inn which he used to frequent and after consulting awhile with the
inn keeper and making some necessary preparations he hired the
grultrud or crier to give notice through the town of a strange
creature to be seen at the sign of the green eagle not so big as a
splacnuck an animal in that country very finely shaped about six feet
long and in every part of the body resembling a human creature could
speak several words and perform a hundred diverting tricks
i was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn which might be
near three hundred feet square my little nurse stood on a low stool
close to the table to take care of me and direct what i should do my
master to avoid a crowd would suffer only thirty people at a time to
see me i walked about on the table as the girl commanded she asked me
questions as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached
and i answered them as loud as i could i turned about several times to
the company paid my humble respects said they were welcome and used
some other speeches i had been taught i took up a thimble filled with
liquor which glumdalclitch had given me for a cup and drank their
health i drew out my hanger and flourished with it after the manner of
fencers in england my nurse gave me a part of a straw which i
exercised as a pike having learnt the art in my youth i was that day
shown to twelve sets of company and as often forced to act over again
the same fopperies till i was half dead with weariness and vexation for
those who had seen me made such wonderful reports that the people were
ready to break down the doors to come in my master for his own
interest would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse and to
prevent danger benches were set round the table at such a distance as to
put me out of every bodys reach however an unlucky school boy aimed a
hazel nut directly at my head which very narrowly missed me otherwise
it came with so much violence that it would have infallibly knocked out
my brains for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin but i had the
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten and turned out of the
my master gave public notice that he would show me again the next
market day and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me
which he had reason enough to do for i was so tired with my first
journey and with entertaining company for eight hours together that i
could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word it was at least three
days before i recovered my strength and that i might have no rest at
home all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round hearing
of my fame came to see me at my masters own house there could not be
fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children for the country
is very populous and my master demanded the rate of a full room
whenever he showed me at home although it were only to a single family
so that for some time i had but little ease every day of the week except
wednesday which is their sabbath although i were not carried to the
my master finding how profitable i was likely to be resolved to carry
me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom having therefore
provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey and
settled his affairs at home he took leave of his wife and upon the 17th
of august 1703 about two months after my arrival we set out for the
metropolis situate near the middle of that empire and about three
thousand miles distance from our house my master made his daughter
glumdalclitch ride behind him she carried me on her lap in a box tied
about her waist the girl had lined it on all sides with the softest
cloth she could get well quilted underneath furnished it with her
babys bed provided me with linen and other necessaries and made
everything as convenient as she could we had no other company but a boy
of the house who rode after us with the luggage
my masters design was to show me in all the towns by the way and to
step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles to any village or
person of qualitys house where he might expect custom we made easy
journeys of not above seven or eight score miles a day for
glumdalclitch on purpose to spare me complained she was tired with the
trotting of the horse she often took me out of my box at my own
desire to give me air and show me the country but always held me fast
by a leading string we passed over five or six rivers many degrees
broader and deeper than the nile or the ganges and there was hardly a
rivulet so small as the thames at london bridge we were ten weeks in
our journey and i was shown in eighteen large towns besides many
on the 26th day of october we arrived at the metropolis called in their
language lorbrulgrud or pride of the universe my master took a
lodging in the principal street of the city not far from the royal
palace and put out bills in the usual form containing an exact
description of my person and parts he hired a large room between three
and four hundred feet wide he provided a table sixty feet in diameter
upon which i was to act my part and pallisadoed it round three feet from
the edge and as many high to prevent my falling over i was shown ten
times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of all people i could now
speak the language tolerably well and perfectly understood every word
that was spoken to me besides i had learnt their alphabet and could
make a shift to explain a sentence here and there for glumdalclitch had
been my instructor while we were at home and at leisure hours during our
journey she carried a little book in her pocket not much larger than a
sansons atlas it was a common treatise for the use of young girls
giving a short account of their religion out of this she taught me my
the author sent for to court the queen buys him of his master the
farmer and presents him to the king he disputes with his majestys
great scholars an apartment at court provided for the author he is in
high favour with the queen he stands up for the honour of his own
the frequent labours i underwent every day made in a few weeks a very
considerable change in my health the more my master got by me the more
insatiable he grew i had quite lost my stomach and was almost reduced
to a skeleton the farmer observed it and concluding i must soon die
resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could while he was thus
reasoning and resolving with himself a sardral or gentleman usher
came from court commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for
the diversion of the queen and her ladies some of the latter had
already been to see me and reported strange things of my beauty
behaviour and good sense her majesty and those who attended her were
beyond measure delighted with my demeanour i fell on my knees and
begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot but this gracious
princess held out her little finger towards me after i was set on the
table which i embraced in both my arms and put the tip of it with the
utmost respect to my lip she made me some general questions about my
country and my travels which i answered as distinctly and in as few
words as i could she asked whether i could be content to live at
court i bowed down to the board of the table and humbly answered
that i was my masters slave but if i were at my own disposal i
should be proud to devote my life to her majestys service she then
asked my master whether he was willing to sell me at a good price
he who apprehended i could not live a month was ready enough to part
with me and demanded a thousand pieces of gold which were ordered him
on the spot each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred
moidores but allowing for the proportion of all things between that
country and europe and the high price of gold among them was hardly so
great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in england i then said to
the queen since i was now her majestys most humble creature and
vassal i must beg the favour that glumdalclitch who had always tended
me with so much care and kindness and understood to do it so well might
be admitted into her service and continue to be my nurse and
her majesty agreed to my petition and easily got the farmers consent
who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court and the poor
girl herself was not able to hide her joy my late master withdrew
bidding me farewell and saying he had left me in a good service to
which i replied not a word only making him a slight bow
the queen observed my coldness and when the farmer was gone out of the
apartment asked me the reason i made bold to tell her majesty that i
owed no other obligation to my late master than his not dashing out the
brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance in his fields which
obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in showing me
through half the kingdom and the price he had now sold me for that the
life i had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times
my strength that my health was much impaired by the continual drudgery
of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day and that if my master
had not thought my life in danger her majesty would not have got so
cheap a bargain but as i was out of all fear of being ill treated under
the protection of so great and good an empress the ornament of nature
the darling of the world the delight of her subjects the phoenix of the
creation so i hoped my late masters apprehensions would appear to be
groundless for i already found my spirits revive by the influence of
this was the sum of my speech delivered with great improprieties and
hesitation the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar
to that people whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch while
the queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking was
however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an
animal she took me in her own hand and carried me to the king who was
then retired to his cabinet his majesty a prince of much gravity and
