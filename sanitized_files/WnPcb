it is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one man
said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals others said
he must have returned home the officer searched till six oclock in the
evening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be found
and no one knew where he was the officer snatched a little food at a
comrades and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich
miloradovich too was away but here he was told that he had gone to a
ball at general kikins and that ermolov was probably there too
why there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a
theyve put two regiments as outposts and theyre having such a spree
there its awful two bands and three sets of singers
the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a
distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldiers dance song
in the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by whistling
and the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts these
sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that he
would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order
entrusted to him it was already past eight oclock he dismounted and
went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained
intact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment room
and the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups
of singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and
immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and among
them ermolovs big imposing figure they all had their coats unbuttoned
and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces
laughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general with
a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility
ha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha ha
the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
he was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one of
the generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informed
ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what the
officer had to say took the papers from him without a word
you think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on the
staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards referring to
ermolov it was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into
trouble youll see what a mess therell be tomorrow
next day the decrepit kutuzov having given orders to be called early
said his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of
having to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his caleche
and drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles from
tarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet he sat
in the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for any
sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun
but all was still quiet a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning on
approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to
water across the road along which he was driving kutuzov looked at them
searchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment they
belonged to they belonged to a column that should have been far in
front and in ambush long before then it may be a mistake thought the
old commander in chief but a little further on he saw infantry
regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressed
eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer the
officer reported that no order to advance had been received
how not rec kutuzov began but checked himself immediately and
sent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited with
drooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down when
eykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appeared
kutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blame
for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance
for him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fell
into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the
ground and he fell upon eykhen threatening him with his hands
shouting and loading him with gross abuse another man captain brozin
who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered the
what sort of another blackguard are you ill have you shot
scoundrels yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms and
he was suffering physically he the commander in chief a serene
highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had
in russia to be placed in this position made the laughingstock of the
whole army i neednt have been in such a hurry to pray about today or
have kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he to
himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to
mock me so and now he was in a state of physical suffering as if
from corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries of
anger and distress but his strength soon began to fail him and looking
about him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again got
into his caleche and drove back in silence
his wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly he
listened to excuses and self justifications ermolov did not come to see
him till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsyn
and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
day and once more kutuzov had to consent
next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
and advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purple
clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troops
advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk out loud to
smoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent their
horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and
they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their
destination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold ground
but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
only count orlov denisov with his cossacks the least important
detachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time this
detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading from
toward dawn count orlov denisov who had dozed off was awakened by a
deserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polish
sergeant of poniatowskis corps who explained in polish that he had
come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought
long ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any of
them and so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said that
murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were and
that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
capture him alive count orlov denisov consulted his fellow officers
the offer was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go and
everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguing
major general grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the
now remember said count orlov denisov to the sergeant at parting
if you have been lying ill have you hanged like a dog but if its
true you shall have a hundred gold pieces
without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode
away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled they disappeared into
the forest and count orlov denisov having seen grekov off returned
shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
had undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemy
camp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
campfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
declivity to his right he looked in that direction but though the
columns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seen
it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french
camp and his keen sighted adjutant confirmed this
oh it is really too late said count orlov looking at the camp
as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our
eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russian
attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he
would lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a
commander in chief from among such a mass of troops
i am sure that rascal was lying said the count
they can still be called back said one of his suite who like count
orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemys
eh really what do you think should we let them go on or not
fetch them back fetch them back said count orlov with sudden
determination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quite
and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov when grekov
returned count orlov denisov excited both by the abandoned attempt and
by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as
well as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his men
mount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and
hurrah ah ah reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies
trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp
one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the
cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking
up ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses
had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind and
around them they would have captured murat and everything there that
was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the
cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of them
listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty eight guns were
taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to
the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had
to be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty divided not
without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves and
it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves
the french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they
formed into detachments and began firing orlov denisov still waiting
for the other columns to arrive advanced no further
meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first
column will march and so on the infantry of the belated columns
commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due order
and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed
places as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt
murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally a
backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew
angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave
vent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward
simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they did
indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually
even got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only in
time to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part of
weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place
finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on bagovuts
corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corps
should long before have joined orlov denisov excited and vexed by the
failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it toll
galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him
severely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting
old soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delay
confusion and cross purposes fell into a rage to everybodys surprise
and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as
well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division
coming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general went
straight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in his
agitation whether going into action now with a single division would
be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he
needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other
bullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for
meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front
but kutuzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but
confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and as
far as was in his power held the troops back he did not advance
he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering
the word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we are
unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich who
we couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else
when kutuzov was informed that at the french rear where according to
the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were
now two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who
was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day
you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but
as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy
ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words
he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutuzov
hes having a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly nudging
with his knee raevski who was at his side
soon after this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked
it is not too late yet your highness the enemy has not gone away if
you were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as see
kutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that murats troops
were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he
the whole battle consisted in what orlov denisovs cossacks had done
the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly
in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration and
bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also
received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades
and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff
thats how everything is done with us all topsy turvy said the
russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it be
understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we
ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but
people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
or deliberately deceive themselves no battle tarutino borodino or
austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated that is an
a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during
a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course
taken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance and
never coincides with the direction of any one force
if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
forces but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by
if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we
find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in
view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
dispositions nor that which count orlov denisov may have had in view
to take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the
whole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the
aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself
nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on
but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the
russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia and
destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tarutino just
because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage
of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine
any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a
minimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatest
confusion the most important results of the whole campaign were
attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the
weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which
napoleons army had only awaited to begin its flight
napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there
can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
hands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient
capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and
incalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only half
the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for
a whole month napoleons position is most brilliant he can either fall
on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate
an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolensk or
vilna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be
required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time
for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow
the troops to loot to prepare winter clothing of which there was
sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the
provisions of which according to the french historians there were
enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleon
that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of
he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his
power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to
him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow
advancing on petersburg or on nizhni novgorod or retiring by a more
northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov afterwards
took nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he
actually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troops
plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
him he quitted moscow approached kutuzov without joining battle
turned to the right and reached malo yaroslavets again without
attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took but retiring
instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road nothing more
stupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the
army as the sequel showed had napoleons aim been to destroy his army
the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of
actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose
independently of anything the russian army might do
napoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed his
army because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be as
unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he
wished to and because he was very clever and a genius
in both cases his personal activity having no more force than the
personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that
the historians quite falsely represent napoleons faculties as having
weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify
his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did
subsequently in 1813 his activity at that time was no less astounding
than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not
know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty
centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there
are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius
in austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french
or german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps
without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans
to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in
germany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius in
order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the
matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right
his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
elsewhere order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from
the time he entered moscow till the time he left it the absence of
citizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did not
disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army
or of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare of the people of
russia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of diplomatic
considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace
with regard to military matters napoleon immediately on his entry into
moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of
the russian army sent army corps out along the different roads and
charged murat to find kutuzov then he gave careful directions about the
fortification of the kremlin and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
with regard to diplomatic questions napoleon summoned captain yakovlev
who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
moscow minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity
and having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which he
considered it his duty to inform his friend and brother that rostopchin
had managed affairs badly in moscow he dispatched yakovlev to
having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutolmin he
dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate
with regard to legal matters immediately after the fires he gave orders
to find and execute the incendiaries and the scoundrel rostopchin was
punished by an order to burn down his houses
with regard to administrative matters moscow was granted a
constitution a municipality was established and the following
your misfortunes are cruel but his majesty the emperor and king desires
to arrest their course terrible examples have taught you how he
punishes disobedience and crime strict measures have been taken to put
an end to disorder and to re establish public security a paternal

the city police is established on its former footing and better order
already prevails in consequence of its activity the government has
appointed two commissaries general or chiefs of police and twenty
commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different
wards of the city you will recognize them by the white ribbon they will
wear on the left arm several churches of different denominations are

given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their
misfortunes these are the measures the government has adopted to re
establish order and relieve your condition but to achieve this aim it
is necessary that you should add your efforts and should if possible

establish public confidence the source of the welfare of a state live
like brothers render mutual aid and protection one to another unite to
defeat the intentions of the evil minded obey the military and civil
authorities and your tears will soon cease to flow
with regard to supplies for the army napoleon decreed that all the
troops in turn should enter moscow a la maraude  to obtain provisions
for themselves so that the army might have its future provided for
with regard to religion napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
and services to be again performed in the churches
with regard to commerce and to provisioning the army the following was
you peaceful inhabitants of moscow artisans and workmen whom
misfortune has driven from the city and you scattered tillers of the
soil still kept out in the fields by groundless fear listen
tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in
it your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places
on finding that they are respected any violence to them or to their

you are hiding in terror return to your huts without fear in full
assurance that you will find protection markets are established in the
city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of
the soil the government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
of sale for them 1 from today peasants husbandmen and those living
in the neighborhood of moscow may without any danger bring their
supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets of which one is on the
mokhovaya street and the other at the provision market 2 such
supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
agree on and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be
free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him
under any pretense 3 sunday and wednesday of each week are appointed
as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops
will be stationed along the highroads on tuesdays and saturdays at such
distances from the town as to protect the carts 4 similar measures
will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no
hindrance on their return journey 5 steps will immediately be taken
inhabitants of the city and villages and you workingmen and artisans
to whatever nation you belong you are called on to carry out the
paternal intentions of his majesty the emperor and king and to co
operate with him for the public welfare lay your respect and confidence
at his feet and do not delay to unite with us
with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people
reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed the emperor rode
through the streets to comfort the inhabitants and despite his
preoccupation with state affairs himself visited the theaters that were
in regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned heads
napoleon also did all in his power he caused the words maison de ma
mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions thereby combining
tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch he
visited the foundling hospital and allowing the orphans saved by him to
kiss his white hands graciously conversed with tutolmin then as
thiers eloquently recounts he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
russian money which he had prepared raising the use of these means by
an act worthy of himself and of the french army he let relief be
distributed to those who had been burned out but as food was too
precious to be given to foreigners who were for the most part enemies
napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
from outside and had paper rubles distributed to them
with reference to army discipline orders were continually being issued
to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
but strange to say all these measures efforts and plans which were
not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did not
affect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a clock detached
from the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without
with reference to the military side the plan of campaign that work of
genius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anything
more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into a
polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was
or could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of
the case the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosquee as
napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been
razed to the ground proved quite useless the mining of the kremlin
only helped toward fulfilling napoleons wish that it should be blown up
when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt
himself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which
napoleon was so concerned produced an unheard of result the french
generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men and
according to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin by
the skill and apparently the genius of murat
with reference to diplomacy all napoleons arguments as to his
magnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief
concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless
alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed
with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a
municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being
with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been
settled by napoleons visit to a mosque no results were achieved two
or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out
napoleons wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french
soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of
another that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned
and locked up the church that night the doors were again broken open
the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders
with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and
to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen and
the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town
as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops
these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in the
kremlin and in posnyakovs house were closed again at once because the
even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as well
as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the
french collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the paper
money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the
unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold
but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
by the authorities at that time was napoleons attempt to stop the
this is what the army authorities were reporting
looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is
not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen
the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the
3rd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even have
the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly
nothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging
robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in our
district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october 11
the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to
stop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning
to the kremlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed
more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the
emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to
such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them
the grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complains
bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to
commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
that army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and
perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not
it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
capture of transport trains on the smolensk road and by the battle of
tarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received by
napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians
thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the whole
fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
stolen napoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but on
seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers says
horror struck and yet with his experience of war he did not order all
the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a
certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches and
carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions the
the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the
skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it
entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal
hearing a rustle rushes straight at the hunters gun runs forward and
back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from his
whole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tarutino
frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the hunters gun
reached him turned back and finally like any wild beast ran back
along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent
during the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been
the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem
to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who holding a
couple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it
early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the
shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue
gray dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him
this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at night
it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again
probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and
had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories
called it femgalka karataev and others called it gray or sometimes
flabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definite
color did not seem to trouble the blue gray dog in the least its furry
tail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so
well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily
and quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everything
pleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight now
bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolic
about playing with a chip of wood or a straw
pierres attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant
of his former clothing a pair of soldiers trousers which by
karataevs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and a
peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this time
he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of
solidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache
covered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested with
lice curled round his head like a cap the look of his eyes was
resolute calm and animatedly alert as never before the former
slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an
energetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were bare
pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
were passing that morning then into the distance across the river then
at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him and
then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
positions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at his
bare feet a smile of animated self satisfaction flitted across his face
the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned
during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him
for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in
the mornings what is called an old wives summer
in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly
pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
on everything far and near lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at
that time of autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distance
with the village the church and the large white house the bare trees
the sand the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spire
and the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in the
transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness
near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half burned mansion
occupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark green
beside the fence and even that ruined and befouled house which in dull
weather was repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now in the
a french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on
his head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner of
the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink
what sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just like
and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe
though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it
to be on the march in such weather he began
pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told
him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in the
shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that something
should be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need not
worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and
arrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everything
that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities
besides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captain
you know he is a man who never forgets anything speak to the captain
when he makes his round he will do anything for you
the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre
you see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril is
a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who has
had misfortunes but he is a man he knows whats what if he wants
anything and asks me he wont get a refusal when one has studied you
see one likes education and well bred people it is for your sake i
mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for you
and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair
he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight between the
prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in
pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had heard pierre
talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said
while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving
moscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door of
the shed rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way
of greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had
given a shirt to sew was in that shed
a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them
which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
ready ready dear fellow said karataev coming out with a neatly
karataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work
was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot his
hair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of lime tree bast
and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever
a promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is
ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn
the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming his
hesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt he had a
long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin bare
body but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
would laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly none
see it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt straight
the frenchman having pushed his head and hands through without raising
his eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams
you see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no proper
tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse said
platon with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his work
its good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french but
it will fit better still when it sets to your body said karataev
still admiring his handiwork youll be nice and comfortable
thanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the
frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and
gave it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over
pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was
saying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the
frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the frenchman
insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
what does he want the bits for said karataev theyd make fine leg
and karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took a
small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
frenchman without looking at him oh dear muttered karataev and went
away the frenchman looked at the linen considered for a moment then
looked inquiringly at pierre and as if pierres look had told him
something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice
platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the odd
there look at that said karataev swaying his head people said
they were not christians but they too have souls its what the old
folk used to say a sweating hands an open hand a dry hands close
hes naked but yet hes given it back
karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
but theyll make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went back
four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though
the french had offered to move him from the mens to the officers shed
he had stayed in the shed where he was first put
in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme
limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physical
strength and health of which he had till then been unconscious and
thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that
it was impossible to say when they began he endured his position not
only lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained the
tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach
he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind that
inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle
of borodino he had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the
dissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of self sacrifice
and in romantic love for natasha he had sought it by reasoning and all
these quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinking
about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
horror of death through privation and through what he recognized in
those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not
now occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics or
napoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business of
his and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
therefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not bound
together he thought repeating words of karataevs which he found
strangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and his
calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now
seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his anger with his wife
and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely
trivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere or
other that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matter
to anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out that
he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite
agreed with him though he understood prince andrews thoughts somewhat
differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could
only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony
as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is
implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre
believed it without any mental reservation the absence of suffering
the satisfaction of ones needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
ones occupation that is of ones way of life now seemed to pierre to
be indubitably mans highest happiness here and now for the first time
he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat
drinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep of
warmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
talk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of ones needs good
food cleanliness and freedom now that he was deprived of all this
seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice of
occupation that is of his way of life now that that was so
restricted seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying ones
needs while great freedom in the choice of occupation such freedom as
his wealth his education and his social position had given him in his
own life is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly
difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an
all pierres daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yet
subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke with
enthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strong
joyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner
freedom which he experienced only during those weeks
when on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn and
saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark
at first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills and the
wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance
when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the
crows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards light
gleamed from the east and the suns rim appeared solemnly from behind a
cloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and the
river all began to sparkle in the glad light pierre felt a new joy and
strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only
stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew in
strength as the hardships of his position increased
that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge of
languages the respect shown him by the french his simplicity his
readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of
three rubles a week made to officers with his strength which he
showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut his
gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still and
thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible
he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the very
