sancho had and they complimented him greatly upon it and begged him to
repeat the letter a couple of times more so that they too might get it
by heart to write it out by and by sancho repeated it three times and
as he did uttered three thousand more absurdities then he told them
more about his master but he never said a word about the blanketing that
had befallen himself in that inn into which he refused to enter he told
them moreover how his lord if he brought him a favourable answer from
the lady dulcinea del toboso was to put himself in the way of
endeavouring to become an emperor or at least a monarch for it had been
so settled between them and with his personal worth and the might of his
arm it was an easy matter to come to be one and how on becoming one his
lord was to make a marriage for him for he would be a widower by that
time as a matter of course and was to give him as a wife one of the
damsels of the empress the heiress of some rich and grand state on the
mainland having nothing to do with islands of any sort for he did not
care for them now all this sancho delivered with so much
composure wiping his nose from time to time and with so little
common sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the
force of don quixotes madness that could run away with this poor mans
reason they did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his
error as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his
conscience it would be better to leave him in it and they would have all
the more amusement in listening to his simplicities and so they bade him
pray to god for his lords health as it was a very likely and a very
feasible thing for him in course of time to come to be an emperor as he
said or at least an archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank
to which sancho made answer if fortune sirs should bring things about
in such a way that my master should have a mind instead of being an
emperor to be an archbishop i should like to know what
they commonly give them said the curate some simple benefice or cure
or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income not
counting the altar fees which may be reckoned at as much more
but for that said sancho the squire must be unmarried and must
know at any rate how to help at mass and if that be so woe is me for
i am married already and i dont know the first letter of the a b c what
will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not
an emperor as is usual and customary with knights errant
be not uneasy friend sancho said the barber for we will entreat
your master and advise him even urging it upon him as a case of
conscience to become an emperor and not an archbishop because it will
be easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered
so i have thought said sancho though i can tell you he is fit for
anything what i mean to do for my part is to pray to our lord to place
him where it may be best for him and where he may be able to bestow most
you speak like a man of sense said the curate and you will be acting
like a good christian but what must now be done is to take steps to coax
your master out of that useless penance you say he is performing and we
had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt and also to
sancho said they might go in but that he would wait there outside and
that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling and
why it did not suit him to enter it but he begged them to bring him out
something to eat and to let it be hot and also to bring barley for
rocinante they left him and went in and presently the barber brought
him out something to eat by and by after they had between them
carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object the
curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour don quixote and
effect their purpose and his notion which he explained to the barber
was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel
while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire and
that they should thus proceed to where don quixote was and he
pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel should ask a favour
of him which as a valiant knight errant he could not refuse to grant
and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her
whither she would conduct him in order to redress a wrong which a wicked
knight had done her while at the same time she should entreat him not to
require her to remove her mask nor ask her any question touching her
circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight and he had
no doubt that don quixote would comply with any request made in these
terms and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own
village where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary
of how the curate and the barber proceeded with their scheme together
with other matters worthy of record in this great history
the curates plan did not seem a bad one to the barber but on the
contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution
they begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady leaving her in pledge a
new cassock of the curates and the barber made a beard out of a
grey brown or red ox tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb
the landlady asked them what they wanted these things for and the curate
told her in a few words about the madness of don quixote and how this
disguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then
was the landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that
the madman was their guest the balsam man and master of the blanketed
squire and they told the curate all that had passed between him and
them not omitting what sancho had been so silent about finally the
landlady dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be
desired she put on him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a
palm broad all slashed and a bodice of green velvet set off by a
binding of white satin which as well as the petticoat must have been
made in the time of king wamba the curate would not let them hood him
but put on his head a little quilted linen cap which he used for a
night cap and bound his forehead with a strip of black silk while with
another he made a mask with which he concealed his beard and face very
well he then put on his hat which was broad enough to serve him for an
umbrella and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself
woman fashion on his mule while the barber mounted his with a beard down
to the waist of mingled red and white for it was as has been said the
they took leave of all and of the good maritornes who sinner as she
was promised to pray a rosary of prayers that god might grant them
success in such an arduous and christian undertaking as that they had in
hand but hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the
curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion as
it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even
though much might depend upon it and saying so to the barber he begged
him to change dresses as it was fitter he should be the distressed
damsel while he himself would play the squires part which would be
less derogatory to his dignity otherwise he was resolved to have nothing
more to do with the matter and let the devil take don quixote just at
this moment sancho came up and on seeing the pair in such a costume he
was unable to restrain his laughter the barber however agreed to do as
the curate wished and altering their plan the curate went on to
instruct him how to play his part and what to say to don quixote to
induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the
place he had chosen for his idle penance the barber told him he could
manage it properly without any instruction and as he did not care to
dress himself up until they were near where don quixote was he folded up
the garments and the curate adjusted his beard and they set out under
the guidance of sancho panza who went along telling them of the
encounter with the madman they met in the sierra saying nothing
however about the finding of the valise and its contents for with all
his simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous
the next day they reached the place where sancho had laid the
broom branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master
and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance and that they
would do well to dress themselves if that was required to deliver his
master for they had already told him that going in this guise and
dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue
his master from the pernicious life he had adopted and they charged him
strictly not to tell his master who they were or that he knew them and
should he ask as ask he would if he had given the letter to dulcinea
to say that he had and that as she did not know how to read she had
given an answer by word of mouth saying that she commanded him on pain
of her displeasure to come and see her at once and it was a very
important matter for himself because in this way and with what they
meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode
of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or
monarch for there was no fear of his becoming an archbishop all this
sancho listened to and fixed it well in his memory and thanked them
heartily for intending to recommend his master to be an emperor instead
of an archbishop for he felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards
on their squires emperors could do more than archbishops errant he said
too that it would be as well for him to go on before them to find him
and give him his ladys answer for that perhaps might be enough to bring
him away from the place without putting them to all this trouble they
approved of what sancho proposed and resolved to wait for him until he
brought back word of having found his master
sancho pushed on into the glens of the sierra leaving them in one
through which there flowed a little gentle rivulet and where the rocks
and trees afforded a cool and grateful shade it was an august day with
all the heat of one and the heat in those parts is intense and the hour
was three in the afternoon all which made the spot the more inviting and
tempted them to wait there for sanchos return which they did they were
reposing then in the shade when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of
any instrument but sweet and pleasing in its tone reached their ears
at which they were not a little astonished as the place did not seem to
them likely quarters for one who sang so well for though it is often
said that shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and
fields this is rather a flight of the poets fancy than the truth and
still more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard
sung were the verses not of rustic shepherds but of the polished wits of
the city and so it proved for the verses they heard were these
what makes my quest of happiness seem vain
what bids me to abandon hope of ease
what holds my heart in anguish of suspense
if that be so then for my grief
what the prime cause of all my woe doth prove
love chance and heaven in league i see
what must i do to find a remedy
what is the lure for love when coy and strange
what if all fail will cure the heart of sadness
if that be so it is but folly
the hour the summer season the solitary place the voice and skill of
the singer all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two
listeners who remained still waiting to hear something more finding
however that the silence continued some little time they resolved to go
in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice but just as they
were about to do so they were checked by the same voice which once more
soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky
and take thy seat among the saints on high
it was thy will to leave on earth below
and makes its vileness bright as virtue show
friendship return to us or force the cheat
that wears it now thy livery to restore
this earth will be the prey of strife once more
the song ended with a deep sigh and again the listeners remained waiting
attentively for the singer to resume but perceiving that the music had
now turned to sobs and heart rending moans they determined to find out
who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs were
piteous and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of a
rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as sancho
had described to them when he told them the story of cardenio he
showing no astonishment when he saw them stood still with his head bent
down upon his breast like one in deep thought without raising his eyes
to look at them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him
the curate who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the
description being a man of good address approached him and in a few
sensible words entreated and urged him to quit a life of such misery
lest he should end it there which would be the greatest of all
misfortunes cardenio was then in his right mind free from any attack of
that madness which so frequently carried him away and seeing them
dressed in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds
could not help showing some surprise especially when he heard them speak
of his case as if it were a well known matter for the curates words
gave him to understand as much so he replied to them thus
i see plainly sirs whoever you may be that heaven whose care it is
to succour the good and even the wicked very often here in this remote
spot cut off from human intercourse sends me though i deserve it not
those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat showing
me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably i act in leading the
life i do but as they know that if i escape from this evil i shall fall
into another still greater perhaps they will set me down as a
weak minded man or what is worse one devoid of reason nor would it be
any wonder for i myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection
of my misfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin that in
spite of myself i become at times like a stone without feeling or
consciousness and i come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and
show me proofs of the things i have done when the terrible fit
overmasters me and all i can do is bewail my lot in vain and idly curse
my destiny and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused to any
that care to hear it for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will
wonder at the effects and if they cannot help me at least they will not
blame me and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into
pity for my woes if it be sirs that you are here with the same design
as others have come wah before you proceed with your wise arguments i
entreat you to hear the story of my countless misfortunes for perhaps
when you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you would
take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it
as they both of them desired nothing more than to hear from his own
lips the cause of his suffering they entreated him to tell it promising
not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish and
thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same
words and manner in which he had related it to don quixote and the
goatherd a few days before when through master elisabad and don
quixotes scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry the tale was
left unfinished as this history has already recorded but now
fortunately the mad fit kept off allowed him to tell it to the end and
so coming to the incident of the note which don fernando had found in
the volume of amadis of gaul cardenio said that he remembered it
perfectly and that it was in these words
every day i discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold you
in higher estimation so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation
without cost to my honour you may easily do so i have a father who
knows you and loves me dearly who without putting any constraint on my
inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you to have if it be
that you value me as you say and as i believe you do
by this letter i was induced as i told you to demand luscinda for my
wife and it was through it that luscinda came to be regarded by don
fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day and
this letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine
could be carried into effect i told don fernando that all luscindas
father was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him which i did
not dare to suggest to him fearing that he would not consent to do so
not because he did not know perfectly well the rank goodness virtue
and beauty of luscinda and that she had qualities that would do honour
to any family in spain but because i was aware that he did not wish me
to marry so soon before seeing what the duke ricardo would do for me in
short i told him i did not venture to mention it to my father as well
on account of that difficulty as of many others that discouraged me
though i knew not well what they were only that it seemed to me that
what i desired was never to come to pass to all this don fernando
answered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father and
persuade him to speak to luscindas father o ambitious marius o cruel
catiline o wicked sylla o perfidious ganelon o treacherous vellido
o vindictive julian o covetous judas traitor cruel vindictive and
perfidious wherein had this poor wretch failed in his fidelity who with
such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys of his heart what
offence did i commit what words did i utter or what counsels did i give
that had not the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim
but woe is me wherefore do i complain for sure it is that when
misfortunes spring from the stars descending from on high they fall upon
us with such fury and violence that no power on earth can check their
course nor human device stay their coming who could have thought that
don fernando a highborn gentleman intelligent bound to me by gratitude
for my services one that could win the object of his love wherever he
might set his affections could have become so obdurate as they say as
to rob me of my one ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession but
laying aside these useless and unavailing reflections let us take up the
to proceed then don fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the
execution of his treacherous and wicked design resolved to send me to
his elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for
six horses which purposely and with the sole object of sending me away
that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme he had purchased
the very day he offered to speak to my father and the price of which he
now desired me to fetch could i have anticipated this treachery could i
by any chance have suspected it nay so far from that i offered with
the greatest pleasure to go at once in my satisfaction at the good
bargain that had been made that night i spoke with luscinda and told
her what had been agreed upon with don fernando and how i had strong
hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised she as
unsuspicious as i was of the treachery of don fernando bade me try to
return speedily as she believed the fulfilment of our desires would be
delayed only so long as my father put off speaking to hers i know not
why it was that on saying this to me her eyes filled with tears and
there came a lump in her throat that prevented her from uttering a word
of many more that it seemed to me she was striving to say to me i was
astonished at this unusual turn which i never before observed in her
for we always conversed whenever good fortune and my ingenuity gave us
the chance with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness mingling tears
sighs jealousies doubts or fears with our words it was all on my part
a eulogy of my good fortune that heaven should have given her to me for
my mistress i glorified her beauty i extolled her worth and her
understanding and she paid me back by praising in me what in her love
for me she thought worthy of praise and besides we had a hundred
thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk
about and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take almost by force
one of her fair white hands and carry it to my lips as well as the
closeness of the low grating that separated us allowed me but the night
before the unhappy day of my departure she wept she moaned she sighed
and she withdrew leaving me filled with perplexity and amazement
overwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affecting signs of grief and
sorrow in luscinda but not to dash my hopes i ascribed it all to the
depth of her love for me and the pain that separation gives those who
love tenderly at last i took my departure sad and dejected my heart
filled with fancies and suspicions but not knowing well what it was i
suspected or fancied plain omens pointing to the sad event and
i reached the place whither i had been sent gave the letter to don
fernandos brother and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed
for he desired me to wait very much against my will eight days in some
place where the duke his father was not likely to see me as his brother
wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge all of which
was a scheme of the treacherous don fernando for his brother had no want
of money to enable him to despatch me at once
the command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it
as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated
from luscinda especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood i have
described to you nevertheless as a dutiful servant i obeyed though i
felt it would be at the cost of my well being but four days later there
came a man in quest of me with a letter which he gave me and which by
the address i perceived to be from luscinda as the writing was hers i
opened it with fear and trepidation persuaded that it must be something
serious that had impelled her to write to me when at a distance as she
seldom did so when i was near before reading it i asked the man who it
was that had given it to him and how long he had been upon the road he
told me that as he happened to be passing through one of the streets of
the city at the hour of noon a very beautiful lady called to him from a
window and with tears in her eyes said to him hurriedly brother if
you are as you seem to be a christian for the love of god i entreat
you to have this letter despatched without a moments delay to the place
and person named in the address all which is well known and by this you
will render a great service to our lord and that you may be at no
inconvenience in doing so take what is in this handkerchief and said
he with this she threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which
were tied up a hundred reals and this gold ring which i bring here
together with the letter i have given you and then without waiting for
any answer she left the window though not before she saw me take the
letter and the handkerchief and i had by signs let her know that i would
do as she bade me and so seeing myself so well paid for the trouble i
would have in bringing it to you and knowing by the address that it was
to you it was sent for senor i know you very well and also unable to
resist that beautiful ladys tears i resolved to trust no one else but
to come myself and give it to you and in sixteen hours from the time
when it was given me i have made the journey which as you know is
all the while the good natured improvised courier was telling me this i
hung upon his words my legs trembling under me so that i could scarcely
stand however i opened the letter and read these words
the promise don fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine
he has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your
advantage i have to tell you senor that he has demanded me for a wife
and my father led away by what he considers don fernandos superiority
over you has favoured his suit so cordially that in two days hence the
betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so privately that the
only witnesses are to be the heavens above and a few of the household
picture to yourself the state i am in judge if it be urgent for you to
come the issue of the affair will show you whether i love you or not
god grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link
itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged
such in brief were the words of the letter words that made me set out
at once without waiting any longer for reply or money for i now saw
clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasure
that had made don fernando send me to his brother the exasperation i
felt against don fernando joined with the fear of losing the prize i had
won by so many years of love and devotion lent me wings so that almost
flying i reached home the same day by the hour which served for speaking
with luscinda i arrived unobserved and left the mule on which i had
come at the house of the worthy man who had brought me the letter and
fortune was pleased to be for once so kind that i found luscinda at the
grating that was the witness of our loves she recognised me at once and
i her but not as she ought to have recognised me or i her but who is
there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the
wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman of a truth no one to
proceed as soon as luscinda saw me she said cardenio i am in my
bridal dress and the treacherous don fernando and my covetous father are
waiting for me in the hall with the other witnesses who shall be the
witnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal be not
distressed my friend but contrive to be present at this sacrifice and
if that cannot be prevented by my words i have a dagger concealed which
will prevent more deliberate violence putting an end to my life and
giving thee a first proof of the love i have borne and bear thee i
replied to her distractedly and hastily in fear lest i should not have
time to reply may thy words be verified by thy deeds lady and if thou
hast a dagger to save thy honour i have a sword to defend thee or kill
i think she could not have heard all these words for i perceived that
they called her away in haste as the bridegroom was waiting now the
night of my sorrow set in the sun of my happiness went down i felt my
eyes bereft of sight my mind of reason i could not enter the house nor
was i capable of any movement but reflecting how important it was that i
should be present at what might take place on the occasion i nerved
myself as best i could and went in for i well knew all the entrances and
outlets and besides with the confusion that in secret pervaded the
house no one took notice of me so without being seen i found an
opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the
hall itself and concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries
from between which i could without being seen see all that took place
in the room who could describe the agitation of heart i suffered as i
stood there the thoughts that came to me the reflections that passed
through my mind they were such as cannot be nor were it well they
should be told suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall
in his usual dress without ornament of any kind as groomsman he had
with him a cousin of luscindas and except the servants of the house
there was no one else in the chamber soon afterwards luscinda came out
from an antechamber attended by her mother and two of her damsels
arrayed and adorned as became her rank and beauty and in full festival
and ceremonial attire my anxiety and distraction did not allow me to
observe or notice particularly what she wore i could only perceive the
colours which were crimson and white and the glitter of the gems and
jewels on her head dress and apparel surpassed by the rare beauty of her
lovely auburn hair that vying with the precious stones and the light of
the four torches that stood in the hall shone with a brighter gleam than
all oh memory mortal foe of my peace why bring before me now the
incomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine were it not better
cruel memory to remind me and recall what she then did that stirred by
a wrong so glaring i may seek if not vengeance now at least to rid
myself of life be not weary sirs of listening to these digressions my
sorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and
briefly for to me each incident seems to call for many words
to this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening
to him but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly being
of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention
to proceed then continued cardenio all being assembled in the hall
the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to
perform the requisite ceremony at the words will you senora luscinda
take senor don fernando here present for your lawful husband as the
holy mother church ordains i thrust my head and neck out from between
the tapestries and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to
listen to luscindas answer awaiting in her reply the sentence of death
or the grant of life oh that i had but dared at that moment to rush
forward crying aloud luscinda luscinda have a care what thou dost
remember what thou owest me bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be
anothers reflect that thy utterance of yes and the end of my life
will come at the same instant o treacherous don fernando robber of my
glory death of my life what seekest thou remember that thou canst not
as a christian attain the object of thy wishes for luscinda is my bride
and i am her husband fool that i am now that i am far away and out of
danger i say i should have done what i did not do now that i have
allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me i curse the robber on
whom i might have taken vengeance had i as much heart for it as i have
for bewailing my fate in short as i was then a coward and a fool
little wonder is it if i am now dying shame stricken remorseful and
the priest stood waiting for the answer of luscinda who for a long time
withheld it and just as i thought she was taking out the dagger to save
her honour or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth
on my behalf i heard her say in a faint and feeble voice i will don
fernando said the same and giving her the ring they stood linked by a
knot that could never be loosed the bridegroom then approached to
embrace his bride and she pressing her hand upon her heart fell
fainting in her mothers arms it only remains now for me to tell you the
state i was in when in that consent that i heard i saw all my hopes
mocked the words and promises of luscinda proved falsehoods and the
recovery of the prize i had that instant lost rendered impossible for
ever i stood stupefied wholly abandoned it seemed by heaven declared
the enemy of the earth that bore me the air refusing me breath for my
sighs the water moisture for my tears it was only the fire that
gathered strength so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy
they were all thrown into confusion by luscindas fainting and as her
mother was unlacing her to give her air a sealed paper was discovered in
her bosom which don fernando seized at once and began to read by the
light of one of the torches as soon as he had read it he seated himself
in a chair leaning his cheek on his hand in the attitude of one deep in
thought without taking any part in the efforts that were being made to
seeing all the household in confusion i ventured to come out regardless
whether i were seen or not and determined if i were to do some
frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation
of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous don fernando and even
in that of the fickle fainting traitress but my fate doubtless
reserving me for greater sorrows if such there be so ordered it that
just then i had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been
wanting to me and so without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest
enemies which might have been easily taken as all thought of me was so
far from their minds i resolved to take it upon myself and on myself
to inflict the pain they deserved perhaps with even greater severity
than i should have dealt out to them had i then slain them for sudden
pain is soon over but that which is protracted by tortures is ever
slaying without ending life in a word i quitted the house and reached
that of the man with whom i had left my mule i made him saddle it for
me mounted without bidding him farewell and rode out of the city like
another lot not daring to turn my head to look back upon it and when i
found myself alone in the open country screened by the darkness of the
night and tempted by the stillness to give vent to my grief without
apprehension or fear of being heard or seen then i broke silence and
lifted up my voice in maledictions upon luscinda and don fernando as if
i could thus avenge the wrong they had done me i called her cruel
ungrateful false thankless but above all covetous since the wealth of
my enemy had blinded the eyes of her affection and turned it from me to
transfer it to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal
and yet in the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding i
found excuses for her saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the
seclusion of her parents house trained and schooled to obey them
always should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they offered
her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction wealth and noble
birth that if she had refused to accept him she would have been thought
out of her senses or to have set her affection elsewhere a suspicion
injurious to her fair name and fame but then again i said had she
declared i was her husband they would have seen that in choosing me she
had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her for before don
fernando had made his offer they themselves could not have desired if
their desires had been ruled by reason a more eligible husband for their
daughter than i was and she before taking the last fatal step of giving
her hand might easily have said that i had already given her mine for i
should have come forward to support any assertion of hers to that effect
in short i came to the conclusion that feeble love little reflection
great ambition and a craving for rank had made her forget the words
with which she had deceived me encouraged and supported by my firm hopes
thus soliloquising and agitated i journeyed onward for the remainder of
the night and by daybreak i reached one of the passes of these
mountains among which i wandered for three days more without taking any
path or road until i came to some meadows lying on i know not which side
of the mountains and there i inquired of some herdsmen in what direction
the most rugged part of the range lay they told me that it was in this
quarter and i at once directed my course hither intending to end my
life here but as i was making my way among these crags my mule dropped
dead through fatigue and hunger or as i think more likely in order to
have done with such a worthless burden as it bore in me i was left on
foot worn out famishing without anyone to help me or any thought of
seeking help and so thus i lay stretched on the ground how long i know
not after which i rose up free from hunger and found beside me some
goatherds who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need
for they told me how they had found me and how i had been uttering
ravings that showed plainly i had lost my reason and since then i am
conscious that i am not always in full possession of it but at times so
deranged and crazed that i do a thousand mad things tearing my clothes
crying aloud in these solitudes cursing my fate and idly calling on the
dear name of her who is my enemy and only seeking to end my life in
lamentation and when i recover my senses i find myself so exhausted and
weary that i can scarcely move most commonly my dwelling is the hollow
of a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body the herdsmen
and goatherds who frequent these mountains moved by compassion furnish
me with food leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks where they think
i may perhaps pass and find it and so even though i may be then out of
my senses the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me
and make me crave it and eager to take it at other times so they tell
me when they find me in a rational mood i sally out upon the road and
though they would gladly give it me i snatch food by force from the
shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts thus do pass the
wretched life that remains to me until it be heavens will to bring it
to a close or so to order my memory that i no longer recollect the
beauty and treachery of luscinda or the wrong done me by don fernando
for if it will do this without depriving me of life i will turn my
thoughts into some better channel if not i can only implore it to have
full mercy on my soul for in myself i feel no power or strength to
release my body from this strait in which i have of my own accord chosen
such sirs is the dismal story of my misfortune say if it be one that
can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me and do not
trouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests
as likely to serve for my relief for it will avail me as much as the
medicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not
take it i have no wish for health without luscinda and since it is her
pleasure to be anothers when she is or should be mine let it be mine
to be a prey to misery when i might have enjoyed happiness she by her
fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable i will strive to gratify
her wishes by seeking destruction and it will show generations to come
that i alone was deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have
a superabundance for to them the impossibility of being consoled is
itself a consolation while to me it is the cause of greater sorrows and
sufferings for i think that even in death there will not be an end of
here cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story as full of
misfortune as it was of love but just as the curate was going to address
some words of comfort to him he was stopped by a voice that reached his
ear saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the fourth part of
this narrative for at this point the sage and sagacious historian cide
hamete benengeli brought the third to a conclusion
which treats of the strange and delightful adventure that befell the
curate and the barber in the same sierra
happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight don
quixote of la mancha was sent into the world for by reason of his having
formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and
restore to the world the long lost and almost defunct order of
knight errantry we now enjoy in this age of ours so poor in light
entertainment not only the charm of his veracious history but also of
the tales and episodes contained in it which are in a measure no less
pleasing ingenious and truthful than the history itself which
resuming its thread carded spun and wound relates that just as the
curate was going to offer consolation to cardenio he was interrupted by
a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones
o god is it possible i have found a place that may serve as a secret
grave for the weary load of this body that i support so unwillingly if
the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not it is so ah woe
is me how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these
rocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to heaven
than that of any human being for there is none on earth to look to for
counsel in doubt comfort in sorrow or relief in distress
all this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him and as it
seemed to them to be uttered close by as indeed it was they got up to
look for the speaker and before they had gone twenty paces they
discovered behind a rock seated at the foot of an ash tree a youth in
the dress of a peasant whose face they were unable at the moment to see
as he was leaning forward bathing his feet in the brook that flowed
past they approached so silently that he did not perceive them being
fully occupied in bathing his feet which were so fair that they looked
like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones
of the brook the whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with
surprise for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to
follow the plough and the oxen as their owners dress suggested and so
finding they had not been noticed the curate who was in front made a
sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock
that lay there which they did observing closely what the youth was
about he had on a loose double skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to
his body with a white cloth he wore besides breeches and gaiters of
brown cloth and on his head a brown montera and he had the gaiters
turned up as far as the middle of the leg which verily seemed to be of
as soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet he wiped them with a
towel he took from under the montera on taking off which he raised his
face and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a
beauty so exquisite that cardenio said to the curate in a whisper
as this is not luscinda it is no human creature but a divine being
the youth then took off the montera and shaking his head from side to
side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of
the sun might have envied by this they knew that what had seemed a
peasant was a lovely woman nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of
them had ever beheld or even cardenios if they had not seen and known
luscinda for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of luscinda
could compare with this the long auburn tresses not only covered her
shoulders but such was their length and abundance concealed her all
round beneath their masses so that except the feet nothing of her form
was visible she now used her hands as a comb and if her feet had seemed
like bits of crystal in the water her hands looked like pieces of driven
snow among her locks all which increased not only the admiration of the
three beholders but their anxiety to learn who she was with this object
they resolved to show themselves and at the stir they made in getting
upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head and parting her hair
from before her eyes with both hands she looked to see who had made the
noise and the instant she perceived them she started to her feet and
without waiting to put on her shoes or gather up her hair hastily
snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she had beside her and
scared and alarmed endeavoured to take flight but before she had gone
six paces she fell to the ground her delicate feet being unable to bear
the roughness of the stones seeing which the three hastened towards
her and the curate addressing her first said
stay senora whoever you may be for those whom you see here only
desire to be of service to you you have no need to attempt a flight so
heedless for neither can your feet bear it nor we allow it
taken by surprise and bewildered she made no reply to these words they
however came towards her and the curate taking her hand went on to say
what your dress would hide senora is made known to us by your hair a
clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your
beauty in a garb so unworthy of it and sent it into solitudes like these
where we have had the good fortune to find you if not to relieve your
distress at least to offer you comfort for no distress so long as life
lasts can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the
sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention and so
senora or senor or whatever you prefer to be dismiss the fears that
our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or
evil fortunes for from all of us together or from each one of us you
while the curate was speaking the disguised damsel stood as if
spell bound looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word
just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never
seen before has been suddenly shown but on the curate addressing some
further words to the same effect to her sighing deeply she broke silence
since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me and
the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in
falsehoods it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of
what if you were to believe me you would believe more out of courtesy
than for any other reason this being so i say i thank you sirs for
the offer you have made me which places me under the obligation of
complying with the request you have made of me though i fear the account
i shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as
compassion for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or
any consolation to alleviate them however that my honour may not be
left a matter of doubt in your minds now that you have discovered me to
be a woman and see that i am young alone and in this dress things
that taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good
name i feel bound to tell what i would willingly keep secret if i
all this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any
hesitation with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not
less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty and as they again
repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise she
without further pressing first modestly covering her feet and gathering
up her hair seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her
and after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes in a
clear and steady voice began her story thus
in this andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which
makes him one of those that are called grandees of spain this nobleman
has two sons the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his good
qualities the younger heir to i know not what unless it be the
treachery of vellido and the falsehood of ganelon my parents are this
lords vassals lowly in origin but so wealthy that if birth had
conferred as much on them as fortune they would have had nothing left to
desire nor should i have had reason to fear trouble like that in which i
find myself now for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not
having been nobly born it is true they are not so low that they have any
reason to be ashamed of their condition but neither are they so high as
to remove from my mind the impression that my mishap comes of their
humble birth they are in short peasants plain homely people without
any taint of disreputable blood and as the saying is old rusty
christians but so rich that by their wealth and free handed way of life
they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth and even
by position though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was
having me for their daughter and as they have no other child to make
their heir and are affectionate parents i was one of the most indulged
i was the mirror in which they beheld themselves the staff of their old
age and the object in which with submission to heaven all their wishes
centred and mine were in accordance with theirs for i knew their worth
and as i was mistress of their hearts so was i also of their
possessions through me they engaged or dismissed their servants through
my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped the
oil mills the wine presses the count of the flocks and herds the
beehives all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have
i had under my care and i acted as steward and mistress with an
assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that i cannot well
describe to you the leisure hours left to me after i had given the
requisite orders to the head shepherds overseers and other labourers i
passed in such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for
young girls those that the needle embroidery cushion and spinning
wheel usually afford and if to refresh my mind i quitted them for a
while i found recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the
harp for experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and
relieves weariness of spirit such was the life i led in my parents
house and if i have depicted it thus minutely it is not out of
ostentation or to let you know that i am rich but that you may see how
without any fault of mine i have fallen from the happy condition i have
described to the misery i am in at present the truth is that while i
was leading this busy life in a retirement that might compare with that
of a monastery and unseen as i thought by any except the servants of the
house for when i went to mass it was so early in the morning and i was
so closely attended by my mother and the women of the household and so
thickly veiled and so shy that my eyes scarcely saw more ground than i
trod on in spite of all this the eyes of love or idleness more
properly speaking that the lynxs cannot rival discovered me with the
help of the assiduity of don fernando for that is the name of the
younger son of the duke i told of
the moment the speaker mentioned the name of don fernando cardenio
changed colour and broke into a sweat with such signs of emotion that
the curate and the barber who observed it feared that one of the mad
fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him but
cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet regarding the
peasant girl with fixed attention for he began to suspect who she was
she however without noticing the excitement of cardenio continuing her
and they had hardly discovered me when as he owned afterwards he was
smitten with a violent love for me as the manner in which it displayed
itself plainly showed but to shorten the long recital of my woes i will
pass over in silence all the artifices employed by don fernando for
declaring his passion for me he bribed all the household he gave and
offered gifts and presents to my parents every day was like a holiday or
a merry making in our street by night no one could sleep for the music
the love letters that used to come to my hand no one knew how were
innumerable full of tender pleadings and pledges containing more
promises and oaths than there were letters in them all which not only
did not soften me but hardened my heart against him as if he had been
my mortal enemy and as if everything he did to make me yield were done
with the opposite intention not that the high bred bearing of don
fernando was disagreeable to me or that i found his importunities
wearisome for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself
so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction and i was not
displeased at seeing my praises in his letters for however ugly we women
may be it seems to me it always pleases us to hear ourselves called
beautiful but that my own sense of right was opposed to all this as
well as the repeated advice of my parents who now very plainly perceived
don fernandos purpose for he cared very little if all the world knew
it they told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to
my virtue and rectitude alone and bade me consider the disparity between
don fernando and myself from which i might conclude that his intentions
whatever he might say to the contrary had for their aim his own pleasure
rather than my advantage and if i were at all desirous of opposing an
obstacle to his unreasonable suit they were ready they said to marry
me at once to anyone i preferred either among the leading people of our
own town or of any of those in the neighbourhood for with their wealth
and my good name a match might be looked for in any quarter this offer
and their sound advice strengthened my resolution and i never gave don
fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success
all this caution of mine which he must have taken for coyness had
apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite for that is the
name i give to his passion for me had it been what he declared it to be
you would not know of it now because there would have been no occasion
to tell you of it at length he learned that my parents were
contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of
obtaining possession of me or at least to secure additional protectors
to watch over me and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you
shall hear one night as i was in my chamber with no other companion
than a damsel who waited on me with the doors carefully locked lest my
honour should be imperilled through any carelessness i know not nor can
conceive how it happened but with all this seclusion and these
precautions and in the solitude and silence of my retirement i found
him standing before me a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my
eyes of sight and my tongue of speech i had no power to utter a cry
nor i think did he give me time to utter one as he immediately
approached me and taking me in his arms for overwhelmed as i was i
was powerless i say to help myself he began to make such professions
to me that i know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing
them up to seem so like truth and the traitor contrived that his tears
should vouch for his words and his sighs for his sincerity
i a poor young creature alone ill versed among my people in cases such
as this began i know not how to think all these lying protestations
true though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything more
than pure compassion and so as the first feeling of bewilderment passed
away and i began in some degree to recover myself i said to him with
more courage than i thought i could have possessed if as i am now in
your arms senor i were in the claws of a fierce lion and my
deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the
prejudice of my honour it would no more be in my power to do it or say
it than it would be possible that what was should not have been so
then if you hold my body clasped in your arms i hold my soul secured by
virtuous intentions very different from yours as you will see if you
attempt to carry them into effect by force i am your vassal but i am
not your slave your nobility neither has nor should have any right to
dishonour or degrade my humble birth and low born peasant as i am i
have my self respect as much as you a lord and gentleman with me your
violence will be to no purpose your wealth will have no weight your
words will have no power to deceive me nor your sighs or tears to soften
me were i to see any of the things i speak of in him whom my parents
gave me as a husband his will should be mine and mine should be bounded
by his and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were
not would willingly yield him what you senor would now obtain by force
and this i say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband
shall ever win anything of me if that said this disloyal gentleman
be the only scruple you feel fairest dorothea for that is the name of
this unhappy being see here i give you my hand to be yours and let
heaven from which nothing is hid and this image of our lady you have
when cardenio heard her say she was called dorothea he showed fresh
agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion but he
was unwilling to interrupt the story and wished to hear the end of what
he already all but knew so he merely said
what is dorothea your name senora i have heard of another of the same
name who can perhaps match your misfortunes but proceed by and by i may
tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your
dorothea was struck by cardenios words as well as by his strange and
miserable attire and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to
tell it to her at once for if fortune had left her any blessing it was
courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her as she felt sure
that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she
i would not let the occasion pass senora replied cardenio of
telling you what i think if what i suspect were the truth but so far
there has been no opportunity nor is it of any importance to you to know
be it as it may replied dorothea what happened in my story was that
don fernando taking an image that stood in the chamber placed it as a
witness of our betrothal and with the most binding words and extravagant
oaths gave me his promise to become my husband though before he had made
an end of pledging himself i bade him consider well what he was doing
and think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a
peasant girl and one of his vassals i told him not to let my beauty
such as it was blind him for that was not enough to furnish an excuse
for his transgression and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me
any kindness it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the
level my condition required for marriages so unequal never brought
happiness nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began
all this that i have now repeated i said to him and much more which i
cannot recollect but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his
purpose he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about
difficulties when he is striking the bargain at the same time i argued
the matter briefly in my own mind saying to myself i shall not be the
first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station nor
will don fernando be the first whom beauty or as is more likely a blind
attachment has led to mate himself below his rank then since i am
introducing no new usage or practice i may as well avail myself of the
honour that chance offers me for even though his inclination for me
should not outlast the attainment of his wishes i shall be after all
his wife before god and if i strive to repel him by scorn i can see
that fair means failing he is in a mood to use force and i shall be
left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those
who cannot know how innocently i have come to be in this position for
what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my
all these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment but
the oaths of don fernando the witnesses he appealed to the tears he
shed and lastly the charms of his person and his high bred grace which
accompanied by such signs of genuine love might well have conquered a
heart even more free and coy than mine these were the things that more
than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin i called
my waiting maid to me that there might be a witness on earth besides
those in heaven and again don fernando renewed and repeated his oaths
