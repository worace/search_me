carriage and leisurely mount the box to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof the country people hanging about press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in a little child carried by its
mother has its short arm held out for it that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine
one can depart forward my postilions a good journey
i salute you citizens and the first danger passed
these are again the words of jarvis lorry as he clasps his hands and
looks upward there is terror in the carriage there is weeping there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller
are we not going too slowly can they not be induced to go faster
it would seem like flight my darling i must not urge them too much
look back look back and see if we are pursued
the road is clear my dearest so far we are not pursued
houses in twos and threes pass by us solitary farms ruinous buildings
dye works tanneries and the like open country avenues of leafless
trees the hard uneven pavement is under us the soft deep mud is on
either side sometimes we strike into the skirting mud to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us sometimes we stick in ruts and
sloughs there the agony of our impatience is then so great that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running hiding doing
out of the open country in again among ruinous buildings solitary
farms dye works tanneries and the like cottages in twos and threes
avenues of leafless trees have these men deceived us and taken us back
by another road is not this the same place twice over thank heaven
no a village look back look back and see if we are pursued hush
leisurely our four horses are taken out leisurely the coach stands in
the little street bereft of horses and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again leisurely the new horses come into visible
existence one by one leisurely the new postilions follow sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips leisurely the old postilions count
their money make wrong additions and arrive at dissatisfied results
all the time our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled
at length the new postilions are in their saddles and the old are left
behind we are through the village up the hill and down the hill and
on the low watery grounds suddenly the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation and the horses are pulled up almost on their
what is it asks mr lorry looking out at window
 at the last post how many to the guillotine to day
i said so a brave number my fellow citizen here would have it
forty two ten more heads are worth having the guillotine goes
the night comes on dark he moves more he is beginning to revive and
to speak intelligibly he thinks they are still together he asks him
by his name what he has in his hand o pity us kind heaven and help
us look out look out and see if we are pursued
the wind is rushing after us and the clouds are flying after us and
the moon is plunging after us and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us but so far we are pursued by nothing else
in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury not in the wine shop did madame
defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the wood sawyer
erst a mender of roads the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference but abided at a little distance like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required or to offer an opinion until invited
but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good
there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak my husband
fellow citizen is a good republican and a bold man he has deserved
well of the republic and possesses its confidence but my husband has
his weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor
it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking his head
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth it is not quite like a good
see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i he may wear
his head or lose it for any interest i have in him it is all one to
me but the evremonde people are to be exterminated and the wife and
she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three i have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming when samson held
them up ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure
madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little
the child also observed jacques three with a meditative enjoyment
of his words has golden hair and blue eyes and we seldom have a child
in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction
i cannot trust my husband in this matter not only do i feel since
last night that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects
but also i feel that if i delay there is danger of his giving warning
that must never be croaked jacques three no one must escape we
have not half enough as it is we ought to have six score a day
in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility i must act for myself
the wood sawyer who held her in the respect and himself in the
submission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap
touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly
that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bear witness to them
ay ay why not cried the sawyer every day in all weathers from
two to four always signalling sometimes with the little one sometimes
without i know what i know i have seen with my eyes
he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile
rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness i answer for my
now let me see said madame defarge pondering again yet once more
can i spare this doctor to my husband i have no feeling either way can
he would count as one head observed jacques three in a low voice
we really have not heads enough it would be a pity i think
he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge i
cannot speak of one without the other and i must not be silent and
trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here for i am not a
the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses the little citizen not to be outdone declared her to be a
he must take his chance said madame defarge no i cannot spare
him you are engaged at three oclock you are going to see the batch of
the question was addressed to the wood sawyer who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been
suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of madame defarges head of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety every hour in the day
i said madame am equally engaged at the same place after it is
over say at eight to night come you to me in saint antoine and we
will give information against these people at my section
the wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness the citizeness looking at him he became embarrassed evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done retreated among his wood and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw
madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door and there expounded her further views to them thus
she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death she will
be mourning and grieving she will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the republic she will be full of sympathy with its enemies
what an admirable woman what an adorable woman exclaimed jacques
three rapturously ah my cherished cried the vengeance and
take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her
lieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat keep
me my usual chair go you there straight for there will probably be a
i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance with
alacrity and kissing her cheek you will not be late
and before the tumbrils arrive be sure you are there my soul said
the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the
madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the
mud and round the corner of the prison wall the vengeance and the
juryman looking after her as she walked away were highly appreciative
of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments
there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman now taking her way along the streets of a
strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great
determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities the troubled time would have
heaved her up under any circumstances but imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong and an inveterate hatred of a class
opportunity had developed her into a tigress she was absolutely without
pity if she had ever had the virtue in her it had quite gone out of
it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers she saw not him but them it was nothing to her that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan that was
insufficient punishment because they were her natural enemies and
her prey and as such had no right to live to appeal to her was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself if she had
been laid low in the streets in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged she would not have pitied herself nor if she had
been ordered to the axe to morrow would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe carelessly
worn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap lying hidden in her
bosom was a loaded pistol lying hidden at her waist was a sharpened
dagger thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such
a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood bare foot and bare legged on the brown
sea sand madame defarge took her way along the streets
now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load had been planned out last night
the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr lorrys
attention it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers should be reduced to the utmost since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there
finally he had proposed after anxious consideration that miss pross
and jerry who were at liberty to leave the city should leave it at
three oclock in the lightest wheeled conveyance known to that period
unencumbered with luggage they would soon overtake the coach and
passing it and preceding it on the road would order its horses in
advance and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night when delay was the most to be dreaded
seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy she and jerry had
beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge
taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the
else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation
now what do you think mr cruncher said miss pross whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or move or live
what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard another
carriage having already gone from here to day it might awaken
my opinion miss returned mr cruncher is as youre right likewise
wot ill stand by you right or wrong
i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures said
miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable of forming any plan are
you capable of forming any plan my dear good mr cruncher
respectin a future spear o life miss returned mr cruncher i
hope so respectin any present use o this here blessed old head o
mine i think not would you do me the favour miss to take notice o
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
oh for gracious sake cried miss pross still wildly crying record
them at once and get them out of the way like an excellent man
first said mr cruncher who was all in a tremble and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out o this never no
more will i do it never no more
i am quite sure mr cruncher returned miss pross that you
never will do it again whatever it is and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is
no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you second them
poor things well out o this and never no more will i interfere with
whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be said miss pross
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it
is best that mrs cruncher should have it entirely under her own
i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded mr cruncher with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit and let my words
be took down and took to mrs cruncher through yourself that wot my
opinions respectin flopping has undergone a change and that wot i only
hope with all my heart as mrs cruncher may be a flopping at the present
there there there i hope she is my dear man cried the distracted
miss pross and i hope she finds it answering her expectations
forbid it proceeded mr cruncher with additional solemnity
additional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now forbid it as we shouldnt all
flop if it was anyways conwenient to get em out o this here dismal
risk forbid it miss wot i say for bid it this was mr crunchers
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one
and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came
if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross you may rely
upon my telling mrs cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said and at all events
you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time now pray let us think my esteemed mr
still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer
if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for me wouldnt
where could you wait for me asked miss pross
mr cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame
by the cathedral door said miss pross would it be much out of
the way to take me in near the great cathedral door between the two
then like the best of men said miss pross go to the posting house
i am doubtful said mr cruncher hesitating and shaking his head
about leaving of you you see we dont know what may happen
heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fear for me
take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near it as you can
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here i feel certain
of it there bless you mr cruncher think not of me but of the lives
this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his decided mr cruncher with an encouraging nod or two he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her by herself
the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution was a great relief to miss pross the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets was another relief she looked at her watch and it was twenty
minutes past two she had no time to lose but must get ready at once
afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms and of half imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes
which were swollen and red haunted by her feverish apprehensions she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out for she saw a figure standing in the room
the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge by strange stern ways and through much staining blood
those feet had come to meet that water
madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evremonde
it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standing open
and would suggest the flight her first act was to shut them there were
four in the room and she shut them all she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied
madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement
and rested on her when it was finished miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness
of her appearance but she too was a determined woman in her different
way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes every inch
you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said miss
pross in her breathing nevertheless you shall not get the better of
madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of
miss prosss own perception that they two were at bay she saw a tight
hard wiry woman before her as mr lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand in the years gone by she knew full well that
miss pross was the familys devoted friend miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the familys malevolent enemy
on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing i
i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and you may
depend upon it ill hold my own against them
each spoke in her own language neither understood the others words
both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look and manner what
it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment said madame defarge good patriots will know what that means
let me see her go tell her that i wish to see her do you hear
if those eyes of yours were bed winches returned miss pross and i
was an english four poster they shouldnt loose a splinter of me no
you wicked foreign woman i am your match
madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
woman imbecile and pig like said madame defarge frowning i take no
answer from you i demand to see her either tell her that i demand
to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her
this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm
i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language but i would give all i have
except the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth or any
neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her but she now advanced one step
i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate i dont care an
english twopence for myself i know that the longer i keep you here the
greater hope there is for my ladybird ill not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me
thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breath
thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life
but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness ha ha she
laughed you poor wretch what are you worth i address myself to that
doctor then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor wife
of evremonde child of evremonde any person but this miserable fool
perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone
three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in
those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packing there
are odds and ends upon the ground there is no one in that room behind
never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as
if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and
as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not you are
uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself and you shall not
know that if i can prevent your knowing it and know that or not know
that you shall not leave here while i can hold you
i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me
i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said
we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard we are
not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
madame defarge made at the door miss pross on the instinct of the
moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and held her tight
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike miss pross
with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate
clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman
soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled
waist it is under my arm said miss pross in smothered tones you
shall not draw it i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies
madame defarges hands were at her bosom miss pross looked up saw
what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash and stood
all this was in a second as the smoke cleared leaving an awful
stillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furious woman
in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help happily she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did in time to check herself and go back it was dreadful to
go in at the door again but she did go in and even went near it to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear these she put on
out on the staircase first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry and then got up and hurried away
by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped by good fortune too she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman she needed both advantages for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was torn and her
dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a
in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and waiting there
she thought what if the key were already taken in a net what if
it were identified what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to prison and
charged with murder in the midst of these fluttering thoughts the
escort appeared took her in and took her away
is there any noise in the streets she asked him
the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
i dont hear you said miss pross what do you say
it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross could
not hear him so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher amazed at
all events shell see that and she did
is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life
blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more and
more disturbed wot can she have been a takin to keep her courage up
hark theres the roll of them dreadful carts you can hear that miss
i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her nothing o
my good man there was first a great crash and then a great stillness
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts
if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh their
journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder its my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world
along the paris streets the death carts rumble hollow and harsh six
tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine all the devouring and
insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself
are fused in the one realisation guillotine and yet there is not in
france with its rich variety of soil and climate a blade a leaf
a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror crush
humanity out of shape once more under similar hammers and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again and it will surely yield
six tumbrils roll along the streets change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles the
toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my fathers
house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving peasants
no the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the creator never reverses his transformations if thou be changed
into this shape by the will of god say the seers to the enchanted in
the wise arabian stories then remain so but if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration then resume thy former aspect
as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go steadily onward
so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle that
in many windows there are no people and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils here and there the inmate has visitors to see the sight
then he points his finger with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent to this cart and to this and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday and who there the day before
of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres and in pictures several close their eyes
and think or try to get their straying thoughts together only one and
he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so shattered and made
drunk by horror that he sings and tries to dance not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture to the pity of the people
there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked some
question it would seem to be always the same question for it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart the
horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it with
their swords the leading curiosity is to know which is he he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart and holds his hand he has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him and always speaks to the
girl here and there in the long street of st honore cries are raised
against him if they move him at all it is only to a quiet smile as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face he cannot easily
on the steps of a church awaiting the coming up of the tumbrils stands
the spy and prison sheep he looks into the first of them not there
he looks into the second not there he already asks himself has he
sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks into the third
which is evremonde says a man behind him
the man cries down evremonde to the guillotine all aristocrats
he is going to pay the forfeit it will be paid in five minutes more
but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him evremonde then sees the
spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way
the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution and
end the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden of
public diversion are a number of women busily knitting on one of the
fore most chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her friend
therese she cries in her shrill tones who has seen her therese
she never missed before says a knitting woman of the sisterhood
no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly therese
ay louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair and
here are the tumbrils and evremonde will be despatched in a wink and
she not here see her knitting in my hand and her empty chair ready for
as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads the ministers of sainte guillotine are
robed and ready crash a head is held up and the knitting women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up crash and
the knitting women never faltering or pausing in their work count two
the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out but
still holds it as he promised he gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls and she looks into
but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here to day i think you were sent to me by
or you to me says sydney carton keep your eyes upon me dear child
i mind nothing while i hold your hand i shall mind nothing when i let
the two stand in the fast thinning throng of victims but they speak as
if they were alone eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand heart to
heart these two children of the universal mother else so wide apart
and differing have come together on the dark highway to repair home
brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last question i
am very ignorant and it troubles me just a little
i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly she is five years younger than i and she lives in a
farmers house in the south country poverty parted us and she knows
nothing of my fate for i cannot write and if i could how should i
tell her it is better as it is
what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is this if the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she may
live a long time she may even live to be old
do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and tremble
that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the better land
where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered
it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble there
you comfort me so much i am so ignorant am i to kiss you now is the
she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face she goes next before
him is gone the knitting women count twenty two
i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth
in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and
the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd so that it swells
forward in a mass like one great heave of water all flashes away
they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there many added that he looked
one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe a woman had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her if he had given any
utterance to his and they were prophetic they would have been these
i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the judge
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old perishing by this retributive instrument before it shall cease
out of its present use i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss and in their struggles to be truly free in
their triumphs and defeats through long years to come i see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out
i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more i see
her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name i see her father
aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all men in his
healing office and at peace i see the good old man so long their
friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has and passing
i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence i see her an old woman weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day i see her and her husband their
course done lying side by side in their last earthly bed and i know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the others soul
than i was in the souls of both
i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine i see him
winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his i see the blots i threw upon it faded away i see him
fore most of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my name
with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place then fair to
look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement and i hear him
tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering voice
it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a
far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known
