from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had
followed all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with
shortly after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank jean
valjean had felt himself carried out then driven off he knew from the
diminution in the jolting when they left the pavements and reached the
earth road he had divined from a dull noise that they were crossing
the bridge of austerlitz at the first halt he had understood that they
were entering the cemetery at the second halt he said to himself
suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin then a harsh grating against
the planks he explained it to himself as the rope which was being
fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity
the undertakers man and the grave digger had probably allowed the
coffin to lose its balance and had lowered the head before the foot he
recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless
a voice rose above him glacial and solemn he heard latin words which
he did not understand pass over him so slowly that he was able to
qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere evigilabunt alii in vitam aeternam et
he heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on
the plank which covered him it was probably the holy water
he thought this will be over soon now patience for a little while
longer the priest will take his departure fauchelevent will take
mestienne off to drink i shall be left then fauchelevent will return
alone and i shall get out that will be the work of a good hour
jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating
there they are going now thought he i am alone
all at once he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a
it was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin
one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up
there are things which are too strong for the strongest man jean
chapter vii in which will be found the origin of the saying dont lose
this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean
when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had
entered the carriage again and taken their departure fauchelevent who
had not taken his eyes from the grave digger saw the latter bend over
and grasp his shovel which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt
he placed himself between the grave and the grave digger crossed his
the grave digger stared at him in amazement and replied
go to the devil said the grave digger
and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin
the coffin gave back a hollow sound fauchelevent felt himself stagger
and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself he shouted
in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to
the grave digger took some more earth on his shovel fauchelevent
listen to me comrade i am the convent grave digger i have come
to help you it is a business which can be performed at night let us
and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy
reflection occurred to him and if he drinks will he get drunk
provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i
consent we will drink after work never before
and he flourished his shovel briskly fauchelevent held him back
oh come said the grave digger you are a bell ringer ding dong
ding dong thats all you know how to say go hang yourself
fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was
come along and drink he cried since it is i who pays the bill
when we have put the child to bed said the grave digger
then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added
its cold to night you see and the corpse would shriek out after us
if we were to plant her there without a coverlet
at that moment as he loaded his shovel the grave digger bent over
and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped fauchelevents wild gaze fell
mechanically into that pocket and there it stopped
the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light
enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of
the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain
traversed fauchelevents pupils an idea had just occurred to him
he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the
grave digger who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth
observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of
the man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave
just as he turned round to get the fifth fauchelevent looked calmly at
by the way you new man have you your card
the sun is on the point of setting
thats good it is going to put on its nightcap
the gate of the cemetery will close immediately
having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other he passed
on to his fobs explored the first returned to the second
why no said he i have not my card i must have forgotten it
the grave digger turned green green is the pallor of livid people
ah jesus mon dieu bancroche a bas la lune17 he exclaimed fifteen
three pieces of a hundred sous said fauchelevent
ah come now conscript said fauchelevent none of this despair
there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave
fifteen francs is fifteen francs and besides you may not be able to
pay it i am an old hand you are a new one i know all the ropes and
the devices i will give you some friendly advice one thing is clear
the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the dome now the
cemetery will be closed in five minutes more
five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is
as hollow as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to
in that case a fine of fifteen francs
but you have time where do you live
a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here no
you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best
once outside the gate you gallop home you get your card you return
the cemetery porter admits you as you have your card there will be
nothing to pay and you will bury your corpse ill watch it for you in
the meantime so that it shall not run away
i am indebted to you for my life peasant
the grave digger overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set off
when the man had disappeared in the thicket fauchelevent listened until
he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the
fauchelevent was seized with a shudder he tumbled rather than climbed
into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried
fauchelevent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his
cold chisel and his hammer and pried up the coffin lid
jean valjeans face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes
fauchelevents hair rose upright on his head he sprang to his feet
then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the
fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh
and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that
his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders he cried
and this is the way i save his life
then the poor man fell to sobbing he soliloquized the while for it is
an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural powerful emotion
it is father mestiennes fault why did that fool die what need was
there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was
expecting it it is he who has killed m madeleine father madeleine
he is in the coffin it is quite handy all is over now is there any
sense in these things ah my god he is dead well and his little
girl what am i to do with her what will the fruit seller say the idea
of its being possible for a man like that to die like this when i think
how he put himself under that cart father madeleine father madeleine
pardine he was suffocated i said so he wouldnt believe me well
heres a pretty trick to play he is dead that good man the very best
man out of all the good gods good folks and his little girl ah in
the first place i wont go back there myself i shall stay here after
having done such a thing as that whats the use of being two old men
if we are two old fools but in the first place how did he manage to
enter the convent that was the beginning of it all one should not
do such things father madeleine father madeleine father madeleine
madeleine monsieur madeleine monsieur le maire he does not hear me
now get out of this scrape if you can
a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance it was
fauchelevent bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounded back and
recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit
jean valjeans eyes were open and gazing at him
to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much
so fauchelevent became like stone pale haggard overwhelmed by all
these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a
living man or a dead one and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at
and he raised himself to a sitting posture
then he sprang to his feet and cried
jean valjean had merely fainted the fresh air had revived him
joy is the ebb of terror fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty
so you are not dead oh how wise you are i called you so much that
you came back when i saw your eyes shut i said good there he is
stifled i should have gone raving mad mad enough for a strait jacket
they would have put me in bicetre what do you suppose i should
have done if you had been dead and your little girl theres that
fruit seller she would never have understood it the child is thrust
into your arms and then the grandfather is dead what a story good
saints of paradise what a tale ah you are alive thats the best of
this remark recalled fauchelevent thoroughly to reality and there was
pressing need of it the souls of these two men were troubled even when
they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it
and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister
let us get out of here quickly exclaimed fauchelevent
he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a gourd with which he had
the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed
a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties
he got out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid
three minutes later they were out of the grave
moreover fauchelevent was perfectly composed he took his time the
cemetery was closed the arrival of the grave digger gribier was not to
be apprehended that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking
for his card and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings
since it was in fauchelevents pocket without a card he could not get
fauchelevent took the shovel and jean valjean the pick axe and
when the grave was full fauchelevent said to jean valjean
let us go i will keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock
jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking he
had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a
corpse the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four
planks he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb
you are benumbed said fauchelevent it is a pity that i have a game
leg for otherwise we might step out briskly
bah replied jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once
they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed on
arriving before the closed gate and the porters pavilion fauchelevent
who held the grave diggers card in his hand dropped it into the box
the porter pulled the rope the gate opened and they went out
how well everything is going said fauchelevent what a capital idea
they passed the vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world
in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two
father madeleine said fauchelevent as they went along and raising
his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than mine show me no
there is no one in the street said fauchelevent give me your
mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me
fauchelevent entered no 87 ascended to the very top guided by the
instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret and knocked in
the dark at the door of an attic
fauchelevent opened the door the grave diggers dwelling was like
all such wretched habitations an unfurnished and encumbered garret
a packing case a coffin perhaps took the place of a commode a
butter pot served for a drinking fountain a straw mattress served for
a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs in a corner on a
tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin
woman and a number of children were piled in a heap the whole of this
poverty stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned one
would have said that there had been an earthquake for one the covers
were displaced the rags scattered about the jug broken the mother had
been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous
and ill tempered search it was plain that the grave digger had made
a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret
from the jug to his wife responsible for its loss he wore an air of
but fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to
take any notice of this sad side of his success
i have brought you back your shovel and pick
and to morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the
and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor
what is the meaning of this demanded gribier
the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket
that i found it on the ground after you were gone that i have buried
the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work
that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have
to pay fifteen francs there you have it conscript
thanks villager exclaimed gribier radiant the next time i will
an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented
themselves at no 62 rue petit picpus the elder of the men lifted the
the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the fruiterers in
the rue du chemin vert where fauchelevent had deposited her on the
preceding day cosette had passed these twenty four hours trembling
silently and understanding nothing she trembled to such a degree that
she wept she had neither eaten nor slept the worthy fruit seller had
plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply
than a melancholy and unvarying gaze cosette had betrayed nothing of
what she had seen and heard during the last two days she divined that
they were passing through a crisis she was deeply conscious that it was
necessary to be good who has not experienced the sovereign power
of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a
terrified little being say nothing fear is mute moreover no one
but when at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty four hours she
beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any
thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry would have guessed
fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass words all the
thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and
the porter who had received his instructions opened the little
servants door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which
could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the
bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance
the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that
point they reached the inner reserved parlor where fauchelevent on the
preceding day had received his orders from the prioress
the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them a vocal mother with
a discreet candle lighted one might almost say made a show of lighting
the prioress passed jean valjean in review there is nothing which
he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead
the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the
the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the
corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said
father fauvent you will get another knee cap with a bell two will be
on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden
and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of
their veils at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two
men fauvent and another man were visible as they dug side by side an
enormous event their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each
the vocal mothers added he is a brother of father fauvent
jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belled
knee cap henceforth he was official his name was ultime fauchelevent
the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the
prioresss observation upon cosette she will grow up ugly
the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy
to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil
there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this
it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are
conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty
do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse
proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than
from the pretty hence a lively taste for plain girls
the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old
fauchelevent he won a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom
he had saved and sheltered in those of grave digger gribier who said
to himself he spared me that fine with the convent which being
enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion
under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god there was a coffin
containing a body in the petit picpus and a coffin without a body in
the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed
thereby but no one was aware of it
as for the convent its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great
fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of
gardeners upon the occasion of the archbishops next visit the
prioress recounted the affair to his grace making something of a
confession at the same time and yet boasting of her deed on leaving
the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper
to m de latil monsieurs confessor afterwards archbishop of reims
and cardinal this admiration for fauchelevent became widespread for it
made its way to rome we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning
pope leo xii to one of his relatives a monsignor in the nuncios
establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of della
genga it contained these lines it appears that there is in a convent
in paris an excellent gardener who is also a holy man named fauvent
nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut he went on
grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds without in the least
suspecting his excellences and his sanctity neither did he suspect his
glory any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published
in the london illustrated news with this inscription bull which
carried off the prize at the cattle show
cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean valjeans
daughter moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and
then she would not have said anything in any case as we have just
observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness cosette
had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to
breathe a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her
she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with
jean valjean she speedily became accustomed to the convent only she
regretted catherine but she dared not say so once however she did
say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her
cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to don
the garb of the pupils of the house jean valjean succeeded in getting
them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside this was the
same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted
the thenardiers inn it was not very threadbare even now jean valjean
locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a
quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a
little valise which he found means of procuring he set this valise on
a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person
father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which
father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action in
addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew
nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less
work since it was shared lastly as he was very fond of snuff he
found the presence of m madeleine an advantage in that he used three
times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more
luxurious manner seeing that m madeleine paid for it
the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the
if these holy women had possessed anything of javerts glance they
would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be
done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder
fauchelevent the old the infirm the lame man who went and never the
other but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how
to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch
on each other they paid no heed to this
moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not
stir out javert watched the quarter for more than a month
this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs
henceforth those four walls constituted his world he saw enough of the
sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to
he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with
fauchelevent this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in
existence in 1845 was composed as the reader already knows of three
chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the
walls the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean
had opposed it in vain to m madeleine by father fauchelevent the
walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nails
whereon to hang the knee cap and the basket a royalist bank note
of 93 applied to the wall over the chimney piece and of which the
this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by
the preceding gardener an old chouan who had died in the convent and
jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very
useful he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found
himself a gardener once more it will be remembered that he knew all
sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture he turned these to
advantage almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted and wild
he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit
cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day as the
sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and
adored him at the appointed hour she flew to the hut when she entered
the lowly cabin she filled it with paradise jean valjean blossomed
out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded
cosette the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far
from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant
than ever at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and
playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the
cosettes face had even undergone a change to a certain extent the
gloom had disappeared from it a smile is the same as sunshine it
recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean
gazed at the windows of her class room and at night he rose to look at
god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette
to uphold and complete the bishops work in jean valjean it is certain
that virtue adjoins pride on one side a bridge built by the devil
exists there jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably
near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the
convent of the petit picpus so long as he had compared himself only to
the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble
but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general
and pride was beginning to spring up who knows he might have ended by
the convent stopped him on that downward path
this was the second place of captivity which he had seen in his youth
in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite
recently again he had beheld another a frightful place a terrible
place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of
justice and the crime of the law now after the galleys he saw the
cloister and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys
and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he
confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety
sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly
he recalled his former companions how wretched they were they rose at
dawn and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they
lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches
thick in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of
the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed
as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen
carters blouse on their backs when it was very cold they drank no
wine and ate no meat except when they went on fatigue duty they
lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a
manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered
voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace
then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes
these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with
lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scoffs of the world
not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders
lacerated with their discipline their names also had vanished from
among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations
they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until
evening without food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a
black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter
without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having
even according to the season the resource of the linen garment or the
woollen cloak and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises
which gave them fever they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during
rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept
not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw and finally they were
not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they
were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment
when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse
themselves to rise and to go and pray in an ice cold and gloomy chapel
on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve
successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the
pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross
what had those men done they had stolen violated pillaged
incendiaries murderers parricides what had these women done they had
on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality
homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other
perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious
assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing
on the one hand confidences over crimes which are exchanged in
whispers on the other the confession of faults made aloud and what
on the one hand miasms on the other an ineffable perfume on the one
hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of
cannon and literally devouring its plague stricken victims on
the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth there
darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light
two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible
a legal limit always in sight and then escape in the second
perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that
faint light of liberty which men call death
in the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by
what flowed from the first an immense curse the gnashing of teeth
hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a
what results flowed from the second blessings and love
and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species
of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same work
jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former that
personal expiation the expiation for ones self but he did not
understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and
without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of
a voice within his conscience replied the most divine of human
here all personal theory is withheld we are only the narrator we
place ourselves at jean valjeans point of view and we translate his
before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest
possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardons men their faults
and which expiates in their stead servitude submitted to torture
accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned for the
sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen the love of humanity
swallowed up in the love of god but even there preserving its distinct
and mediatorial character sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery
of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed
and he remembered that he had dared to murmur
often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful
song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the
blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly
chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he
wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god
there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like
a warning whisper from providence itself the scaling of that wall the
passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of
death the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which
he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in
order to gain entrance into this one was this a symbol of his destiny
this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to
that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an
again he beheld gratings bolts iron bars to guard whom angels
these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now beheld once
this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was
still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other
these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts a cold
harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred
and padlocked grating of the vultures a still harsher and more biting
breeze blew in the cage of these doves
when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in
in these meditations his pride vanished he scrutinized his own heart
in all manner of ways he felt his pettiness and many a time he wept
all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him
back towards the bishops holy injunctions cosette through love the
sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was
deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which
skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had gazed on
the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew
the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer thus he prayed
it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god
everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant
flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those grave and simple
women that silent cloister slowly permeated him and little by little
his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like
the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children
and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had
received him in succession at two critical moments in his life the
first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him
the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit
of him and when the galleys were again yawning and that had it not
been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not
his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more
many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up
