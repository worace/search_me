has been reinstated but how could they fail to do that i think there
were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he and
now this duel have these people no feeling or honor knowing him to
be an only son to challenge him and shoot so straight its well god
had mercy on us and what was it for who doesnt have intrigues
nowadays why if he was so jealous as i see things he should have
shown it sooner but he lets it go on for months and then to call him
out reckoning on fedya not fighting because he owed him money what
baseness what meanness i know you understand fedya my dear count
that believe me is why i am so fond of you few people do understand
him he is such a lofty heavenly soul
dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to rostov in a way no
i know people consider me a bad man he said let them i dont care
a straw about anyone but those i love but those i love i love so that
i would give my life for them and the others id throttle if they stood
in my way i have an adored a priceless mother and two or three
friends you among them and as for the rest i only care about them in
so far as they are harmful or useful and most of them are harmful
especially the women yes dear boy he continued i have met loving
noble high minded men but i have not yet met any women countesses or
cooks who were not venal i have not yet met that divine purity and
devotion i look for in women if i found such a one id give my life for
her but those and he made a gesture of contempt and believe me
if i still value my life it is only because i still hope to meet such a
divine creature who will regenerate purify and elevate me but you
oh yes i quite understand answered rostov who was under his new
in the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winter
denisov also came back and stayed with them the first half of the
winter of 1806 which nicholas rostov spent in moscow was one of the
happiest merriest times for him and the whole family nicholas brought
many young men to his parents house vera was a handsome girl of
twenty sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower
natasha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing now
at that time in the rostovs house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming
girls every young man who came to the house seeing those
impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own
happiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitful
bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
young girls ready for anything and full of hope experienced the same
feeling sharing with the young folk of the rostovs household a
readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness
among the young men introduced by rostov one of the first was dolokhov
whom everyone in the house liked except natasha she almost quarreled
with her brother about him she insisted that he was a bad man and that
in the duel with bezukhov pierre was right and dolokhov wrong and
theres nothing for me to understand she cried out with resolute
self will he is wicked and heartless there now i like your denisov
though he is a rake and all that still i like him so you see i do
understand i dont know how to put it with this one everything is
calculated and i dont like that but denisov
oh denisov is quite different replied nicholas implying that even
denisov was nothing compared to dolokhov you must understand what a
soul there is in dolokhov you should see him with his mother what a
well i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and do
you know he has fallen in love with sonya
natashas prediction proved true dolokhov who did not usually care for
the society of ladies began to come often to the house and the
question for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon
settled he came because of sonya and sonya though she would never
have dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhov
dolokhov often dined at the rostovs never missed a performance at
which they were present and went to iogels balls for young people
which the rostovs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sonya
and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
glances without coloring but even the old countess and natasha blushed
it was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistible
influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another
rostov noticed something new in dolokhovs relations with sonya but he
did not explain to himself what these new relations were theyre
always in love with someone he thought of sonya and natasha but he
was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as before and was less
in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders were
given to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular army
and besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywhere
bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war was
talked of for the rostov family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of
remaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of denisovs
furlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment his
approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rather
gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away
on the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he had
rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and denisov
were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty people
never had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs house as at this
holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved that
is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the one thing
we are interested in here said the spirit of the place
nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without
visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited
returned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed and
felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a
curious embarrassment among some of those present sonya dolokhov and
the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree
natasha nicholas understood that something must have happened between
sonya and dolokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness
natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner on
that same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the
dancing master gave for his pupils during the holidays
nicholas will you come to iogels please do said natasha he asked
where would i not go at the countess command said denisov who at
the rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashas knight im
even weady to dance the pas de chale
if i have time answered nicholas but i promised the arkharovs they
and you he asked dolokhov but as soon as he had asked the question
he noticed that it should not have been put
perhaps coldly and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonya and
scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre at
there is something up thought nicholas and he was further confirmed
in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left immediately after
dinner he called natasha and asked her what was the matter
and i was looking for you said natasha running out to him i told
you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he has
little as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late something
seemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a suitable and
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from
the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
question for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling on
hearing the news was one of anger with sonya he tried to say
thats capital of course shell forget her childish promises and
accept the offer but before he had time to say it natasha began again
and fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause
yes my sonya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas
much as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont change
yes said natasha do you know nicholas dont be angry but i know
you will not marry her i know heaven knows how but i know for certain
now you dont know that at all said nicholas but i must talk to
her what a darling sonya is he added with a smile
ah she is indeed a darling ill send her to you
and natasha kissed her brother and ran away
a minute later sonya came in with a frightened guilty and scared look
nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first time
since his return that they had talked alone and about their love
sophie he began timidly at first and then more and more boldly if
you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous
match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friend
if you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that i
sonya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened look
no but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to say
it if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole truth i
love you and i think i love you more than anyone else
that is enough for me said sonya blushing
no but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love
again though for no one have i such a feeling of friendship
confidence and love as i have for you then i am young mamma does not
wish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to consider
dolokhovs offer he said articulating his friends name with
dont say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother and
you are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of misleading
iogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers as
they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps and
so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were
ready to drop and so said the grown up young men and women who came to
these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable
that year two marriages had come of these balls the two pretty young
princesses gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further
increased the fame of these dances what distinguished them from others
was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good natured
iogel flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of
his art as he collected the tickets from all his visitors there was
the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves
as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for
the first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were or seemed to
be pretty so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes
sometimes the best of the pupils of whom natasha who was exceptionally
graceful was first even danced the pas de chale but at this last ball
only the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka which was just coming
into fashion were danced iogel had taken a ballroom in bezukhovs
house and the ball as everyone said was a great success there were
many pretty girls and the rostov girls were among the prettiest they
were both particularly happy and gay that evening proud of dolokhovs
proposal her refusal and her explanation with nicholas sonya twirled
about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair
plaited and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy
natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
ball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with pink
natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom she was
not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whatever
person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment
oh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to sonya
nicholas and denisov were walking up and down looking with kindly
how sweet she is she will be a weal beauty said denisov
and how she dances what gwace he said again after a pause
my dear count you were one of my best pupils you must dance said
little iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming young
ladies  he turned with the same request to denisov who was also a
no my dear fellow ill be a wallflower said denisov dont you
wecollect what bad use i made of your lessons
oh no said iogel hastening to reassure him you were only
inattentive but you had talent oh yes you had talent
the band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could not
refuse iogel and asked sonya to dance denisov sat down by the old
ladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot told
them something funny and kept them amused while he watched the young
people dancing iogel with natasha his pride and his best pupil were
the first couple noiselessly skillfully stepping with his little feet
in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with natasha who though
shy went on carefully executing her steps denisov did not take his
eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
because he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostov
this is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish mazuwka is
knowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the masterly
way in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to natasha
go and choose denisov he is a real dancer a wonder he said
when it came to natashas turn to choose a partner she rose and
tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows ran
timidly to the corner where denisov sat she saw that everybody was
looking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denisov was refusing
though he smiled delightedly he ran up to them
please vasili dmitrich natasha was saying do come
oh no let me off countess denisov replied
they coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokingly
ill sing for you a whole evening said natasha
oh the faiwy she can do anything with me said denisov and he
unhooked his saber he came out from behind the chairs clasped his
partners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his foot
waiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka was
denisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he
felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways at
his partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with one
foot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room taking
his partner with him he glided silently on one foot half across the
room and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them
when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he stopped
short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking his
spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against his
right flew round again in a circle natasha guessed what he meant to
do and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how
first he spun her round holding her now with his left now with his
right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him and again
jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would
rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and then
he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when at
last smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair he drew
up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her natasha did not even make
him a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if she
although iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyone
was delighted with denisovs skill he was asked again and again as a
partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and the
good old days denisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
with his handkerchief sat down by natasha and did not leave her for the
for two days after that rostov did not see dolokhov at his own or at
dolokhovs home on the third day he received a note from him
as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of
and am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell supper
tonight to my friends come to the english hotel
about ten oclock rostov went to the english hotel straight from the
theater where he had been with his family and denisov he was at once
shown to the best room which dolokhov had taken for that evening some
twenty men were gathered round a table at which dolokhov sat between two
candles on the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he was
keeping the bank rostov had not seen him since his proposal and sonyas
refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet
dolokhovs clear cold glance met rostov as soon as he entered the door
its a long time since we met he said thanks for coming ill just
finish dealing and then ilyushka will come with his chorus
i called once or twice at your house said rostov reddening
rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with dolokhov none but fools trust to luck in play dolokhov had then
or are you afraid to play with me dolokhov now asked as if guessing
beneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
dinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
a need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel action
rostov felt ill at ease he tried but failed to find some joke with
which to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought of
anything dolokhov looking straight in his face said slowly and
do you remember we had a talk about cards hes a fool who trusts to
luck one should make certain and i want to try
to try his luck or the certainty rostov asked himself
well youd better not play dolokhov added and springing a new pack
moving the money forward he prepared to deal rostov sat down by his
side and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at him
and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play
i have no money with me he said
rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and again
lost dolokhov killed that is beat ten cards of rostovs running
gentlemen said dolokhov after he had dealt for some time please
place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoning
one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted
yes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i ask
you to put the money on your cards replied dolokhov dont stint
yourself well settle afterwards he added turning to rostov
the game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne
all rostovs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up
against him he wrote 800 rubles on a card but while the waiter
filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake
leave it said dolokhov though he did not seem to be even looking at
rostov youll win it back all the sooner i lose to the others but win
from you or are you afraid of me he asked again
rostov submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
of hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor he
well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of hearts
on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written 800 rubles in clear
upright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed
him smiled at dolokhovs words and with a sinking heart waiting for a
seven to turn up gazed at dolokhovs hands which held the pack much
depended on rostovs winning or losing on that seven of hearts on the
previous sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles and
though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told
nicholas that this was all he could let him have till may and asked him
to be more economical this time nicholas had replied that it would be
more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take
anything more till the spring now only twelve hundred rubles was left
of that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the
loss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on his
word with a sinking heart he watched dolokhovs hands and thought now
then make haste and let me have this card and ill take my cap and
drive home to supper with denisov natasha and sonya and will
certainly never touch a card again at that moment his home life jokes
with petya talks with sonya duets with natasha piquet with his
father and even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskaya rose
before him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as
if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past he could not
conceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the right
rather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newly
appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of
unknown and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with a
sinking heart the movement of dolokhovs hands those broad reddish
hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down
the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him
so you are not afraid to play with me repeated dolokhov and as if
about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his
yes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscow that
im a sharper so i advise you to be careful
oh those moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the cards with
aah rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the seven
he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he had lost
still dont ruin yourself said dolokhov with a side glance at rostov
an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
the whole interest was concentrated on rostov instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him which
he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely
supposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no longer listening to
stories or telling them but followed every movement of rostovs hands
and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he had decided
to play until that score reached forty three thousand he had fixed on
that number because forty three was the sum of his and sonyas joint
ages rostov leaning his head on both hands sat at the table which was
scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered with
cards one tormenting impression did not leave him that those broad
boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt
sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him in their power
six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backs
impossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double or
quits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostov
pondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dolokhov refused to
accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at
one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
over the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
from the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the
cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
total of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other
players or peered at the now cold face of dolokhov and tried to read
he knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want my ruin
wasnt he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not his fault
whats he to do if he has such luck and its not my fault either
he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyone
or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terrible misfortune
and when did it begin such a little while ago i came to this table with
the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for mammas
name day and then going home i was so happy so free so lighthearted
and i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when did
this new terrible state of things begin what marked the change i sat
all the time in this same place at this table chose and placed cards
and watched those broad boned agile hands in the same way when did it
happen and what has happened i am well and strong and still the same
and in the same place no it cant be surely it will all end in
he was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hot
his face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helpless
the score against him reached the fateful sum of forty three thousand
rostov had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which he meant
to double the three thousand just put down to his score when dolokhov
slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began rapidly adding
up the total of rostovs debt breaking the chalk as he marked the
supper its time for supper and here are the gypsies
some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
and saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas understood that it
was all over but he said in an indifferent tone
well wont you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it were
the fun of the game which interested him most
its all up im lost thought he now a bullet through my brain
thats all thats left me and at the same time he said in a cheerful
come now just this one more little card
all right said dolokhov having finished the addition all right
twenty one rubles he said pointing to the figure twenty one by which
the total exceeded the round sum of forty three thousand and taking up
a pack he prepared to deal rostov submissively unbent the corner of his
card and instead of the six thousand he had intended carefully wrote
its all the same to me he said i only want to see whether you will
let me win this ten or beat it
dolokhov began to deal seriously oh how rostov detested at that moment
those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists which
held him in their power the ten fell to him
you owe forty three thousand count said dolokhov and stretching
himself he rose from the table one does get tired sitting so long he
dolokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him to
when am i to receive the money count
rostov flushing drew dolokhov into the next room
i cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he said
i say rostov said dolokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholas
straight in the eyes you know the saying lucky in love unlucky at
cards your cousin is in love with you i know
oh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power thought
rostov he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother
by the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be to escape it
all and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this
shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a
your cousin dolokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted him
my cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to mention
to say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult but to
go home alone see his sisters brother mother and father confess and
ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor was
at home they had not yet gone to bed the young people after returning
from the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord
as soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
of love which pervaded the rostov household that winter and now after
dolokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed to have grown thicker round
sonya and natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm sonya and
natasha in the light blue dresses they had worn at the theater looking
pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy and
smiling vera was playing chess with shinshin in the drawing room the
old countess waiting for the return of her husband and son sat playing
patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house denisov
with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord striking
chords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling
as he sang with his small husky but true voice some verses called
enchantress which he had composed and to which he was trying to fit
enchantress say to my forsaken lyre what magic power is this recalls
me still what spark has set my inmost soul on fire what is this bliss
he was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling black
agate eyes at the frightened and happy natasha
splendid excellent exclaimed natasha another verse she said
everythings still the same with them thought nicholas glancing into
the drawing room where he saw vera and his mother with the old lady
ah and heres nicholas cried natasha running up to him
i am so glad youve come said natasha without answering him we are
enjoying ourselves vasili dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sake
no papa is not back yet said sonya
nicholas have you come come here dear called the old countess from
nicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at her
table began to watch her hands arranging the cards from the dancing
room they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
all wight all wight shouted denisov its no good making excuses
now its your turn to sing the bacawolla i entweat you
oh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the same
everythings the same with them they know nothing about it where am i
to go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing room where the
sonya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to denisovs
favorite barcarolle natasha was preparing to sing denisov was looking
nicholas began pacing up and down the room
why do they want to make her sing how can she sing theres nothing to
sonya struck the first chord of the prelude
my god im a ruined and dishonored man a bullet through my brain is
the only thing left me not singing his thoughts ran on go away but
he continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denisov and the girls
nikolenka what is the matter sonyas eyes fixed on him seemed to
ask she noticed at once that something had happened to him
nicholas turned away from her natasha too with her quick instinct had
instantly noticed her brothers condition but though she noticed it
she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from sorrow
sadness or self reproach that she purposely deceived herself as young
people often do no i am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by
sympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she said to herself no
i must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just as i am
now sonya she said going to the very middle of the room where she
having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as ballet
dancers do natasha rising energetically from her heels to her toes
stepped to the middle of the room and stood still
yes thats me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze with which
and what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at his
natasha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose her
eyes became serious at that moment she was oblivious of her
surroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but which
leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
natasha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously
mainly because denisov so delighted in her singing she no longer sang
as a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childish
painstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet sing
well as all the connoisseurs who heard her said it is not trained
but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they generally
said this some time after she had finished singing while that untrained
voice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was
sounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in it
and wished to hear it again in her voice there was a virginal
freshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrained
velvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
what is this thought nicholas listening to her with widely opened
eyes what has happened to her how she is singing today and suddenly
the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note the
next phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beats
oh mio crudele affetto one two three one two three
one oh mio crudele affetto one two three one oh this
senseless life of ours thought nicholas all this misery and money
and dolokhov and anger and honor its all nonsense but this is
real now then natasha now then dearest now then darling how
will she take that si shes taken it thank god and without noticing
that he was singing to strengthen the si he sung a second a third
below the high note ah god how fine did i really take it how
oh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finest
in rostovs soul and this something was apart from everything else in
the world and above everything in the world what were losses and
dolokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and rob
it was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did
that day but no sooner had natasha finished her barcarolle than reality
again presented itself he got up without saying a word and went
downstairs to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old count
came in from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing him
well had a good time said the old count smiling gaily and proudly
nicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst into
sobs the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sons
ah it cant be avoided thought nicholas for the first and last
time and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feel ashamed
of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him have the
papa i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting i
dear me said his father who was in a specially good humor i told
you it would not be enough how much
very much said nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless smile
for which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost a little
i mean a good deal a great deal forty three thousand
what to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening with
an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do
well said the old count spreading out his arms and sinking
it cant be helped it happens to everyone said the son with a bold
free and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as a
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime he
longed to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness but
said in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to everyone
the old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sons words and began
yes yes he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficult to
raise happens to everybody yes who has not done it
and with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of the
room nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at all
papa pa pa he called after him sobbing forgive me and seizing
his fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears
while father and son were having their explanation the mother and
daughter were having one not less important natasha came running to her
made made me an offer mamma mamma she exclaimed
the countess did not believe her ears denisov had proposed to whom to
this chit of a girl natasha who not so long ago was playing with dolls
dont natasha what nonsense she said hoping it was a joke
nonsense indeed i am telling you the fact said natasha indignantly
i come to ask you what to do and you call it nonsense
if it is true that monsieur denisov has made you a proposal tell him
no hes not a fool replied natasha indignantly and seriously
well then what do you want youre all in love nowadays well if you

no mamma im not in love with him i suppose im not in love with
mamma are you cross dont be cross dear is it my fault

the countess indignant that they should have dared to treat this little
no not on any account i will tell him myself and youll listen at
the door and natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall
where denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his
he jumped up at the sound of her light step
nataly he said moving with rapid steps toward her decide my fate
vasili dmitrich im so sorry for you no but you are so nice
but it wont donot that but as a friend i shall always love you
denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
understand she kissed his rough curly black head at this instant they
heard the quick rustle of the countess dress she came up to them
vasili dmitrich i thank you for the honor she said with an
embarrassed voice though it sounded severe to denisov but my daughter
is so young and i thought that as my sons friend you would have
addressed yourself first to me in that case you would not have obliged
countess said denisov with downcast eyes and a guilty face he
natasha could not remain calm seeing him in such a plight she began to
countess i have done wong denisov went on in an unsteady voice
but believe me i so adore your daughter and all your family that i
would give my life twice over he looked at the countess and seeing
her severe face said well good by countess and kissing her hand
he left the room with quick resolute strides without looking at
next day rostov saw denisov off he did not wish to stay another day in
moscow all denisovs moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment
at the gypsies with the result that he had no recollection of how he
was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey
after denisovs departure rostov spent another fortnight in moscow
without going out of the house waiting for the money his father could
not at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls room
sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she
wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
love him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
he filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at last
sent dolokhov the whole forty three thousand rubles and received his
receipt he left at the end of november without taking leave of any of
his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in poland
after his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg at the
torzhok post station either there were no horses or the postmaster
would not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressing
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big
feet in their overboots on the table and began to reflect
will you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bed got ready and
pierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he had
begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
question one so important that he took no notice of what went on around
him not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to petersburg
