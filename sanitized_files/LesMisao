would have shuddered the buckle of his leather stock was under his
left ear instead of at the nape of his neck this betrayed unwonted
javert was a complete character who never had a wrinkle in his duty or
in his uniform methodical with malefactors rigid with the buttons of
that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry it was
indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those
emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes
he had come in a simple way had made a requisition on the neighboring
post for a corporal and four soldiers had left the soldiers in the
courtyard had had fantines room pointed out to him by the portress
who was utterly unsuspicious accustomed as she was to seeing armed men
on arriving at fantines chamber javert turned the handle pushed
the door open with the gentleness of a sick nurse or a police spy and
properly speaking he did not enter he stood erect in the half open
door his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat which
was buttoned up to the chin in the bend of his elbow the leaden head of
his enormous cane which was hidden behind him could be seen
thus he remained for nearly a minute without his presence being
perceived all at once fantine raised her eyes saw him and made m
the instant that madeleines glance encountered javerts glance javert
without stirring without moving from his post without approaching him
became terrible no human sentiment can be as terrible as joy
it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul
the satisfaction of at last getting hold of jean valjean caused all that
was in his soul to appear in his countenance the depths having been
stirred up mounted to the surface the humiliation of having in
some slight degree lost the scent and of having indulged for a few
moments in an error with regard to champmathieu was effaced by pride
at having so well and accurately divined in the first place and of
having for so long cherished a just instinct javerts content shone
forth in his sovereign attitude the deformity of triumph overspread
that narrow brow all the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied
javert was in heaven at that moment without putting the thing clearly
to himself but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his
presence and of his success he javert personified justice light and
truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil behind him and
around him at an infinite distance he had authority reason the case
judged the legal conscience the public prosecution all the stars he
was protecting order he was causing the law to yield up its thunders
he was avenging society he was lending a helping hand to the absolute
he was standing erect in the midst of a glory there existed in his
victory a remnant of defiance and of combat erect haughty brilliant
he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious
archangel the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing
caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched
fist happy and indignant he held his heel upon crime vice rebellion
perdition hell he was radiant he exterminated he smiled and there
was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael
javert though frightful had nothing ignoble about him
probity sincerity candor conviction the sense of duty are things
which may become hideous when wrongly directed but which even when
hideous remain grand their majesty the majesty peculiar to the human
conscience clings to them in the midst of horror they are virtues
which have one vice error the honest pitiless joy of a fanatic
in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously
venerable radiance without himself suspecting the fact javert in his
formidable happiness was to be pitied as is every ignorant man who
triumphs nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face
wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the
fantine had not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had torn
her from the man her ailing brain comprehended nothing but the only
thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her she could
not endure that terrible face she felt her life quitting her she hid
her face in both hands and shrieked in her anguish
jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen
he said to fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices
be at ease it is not for you that he is come
there lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words
something indescribably fierce and frenzied javert did not say be
no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered
it was no longer a human word it was a roar
he did not proceed according to his custom he did not enter into the
matter he exhibited no warrant of arrest in his eyes jean valjean
was a sort of mysterious combatant who was not to be laid hands upon
a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five
years without being able to throw him this arrest was not a beginning
but an end he confined himself to saying be quick about it
as he spoke thus he did not advance a single step he hurled at jean
valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook and with
which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him
it was this glance which fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow
at javerts exclamation fantine opened her eyes once more but the
mayor was there what had she to fear
javert advanced to the middle of the room and cried
the unhappy woman glanced about her no one was present excepting the
nun and the mayor to whom could that abject use of thou be addressed
then she beheld a most unprecedented thing a thing so unprecedented
that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest
she beheld javert the police spy seize the mayor by the collar she
saw the mayor bow his head it seemed to her that the world was coming
javert had in fact grasped jean valjean by the collar
javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all
there is no longer any monsieur le maire here
jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the
monsieur said jean valjean i should like to say a word to you in
aloud say it aloud replied javert people are in the habit of
jean valjean went on in a lower tone
i have a request to make of you 
what difference does that make to me i shall not listen
jean valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low
grant me three days grace three days in which to go and fetch the
child of this unhappy woman i will pay whatever is necessary you shall
you are making sport of me cried javert come now i did not think
you such a fool you ask me to give you three days in which to run away
you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creatures child
fantine was seized with a fit of trembling
my child she cried to go and fetch my child she is not here
then answer me sister where is cosette i want my child monsieur
and now theres the other one will you hold your tongue you hussy
its a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates and where
women of the town are cared for like countesses ah but we are going to
he stared intently at fantine and added once more taking into his
i tell you that there is no monsieur madeleine and that there is no
monsieur le maire there is a thief a brigand a convict named jean
valjean and i have him in my grasp thats what there is
fantine raised herself in bed with a bound supporting herself on her
stiffened arms and on both hands she gazed at jean valjean she gazed
at javert she gazed at the nun she opened her mouth as though to
speak a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat her teeth
chattered she stretched out her arms in her agony opening her hands
convulsively and fumbling about her like a drowning person then
her head struck the head board of the bed and fell forwards on her
breast with gaping mouth and staring sightless eyes
jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of javert and opened
it as he would have opened the hand of a baby then he said to javert
lets have an end of this shouted javert in a fury i am not here
to listen to argument let us economize all that the guard is below
march on instantly or youll get the thumb screws
in the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead which was in a
decidedly decrepit state and which served the sisters as a camp bed
when they were watching with the sick jean valjean stepped up to this
bed in a twinkling wrenched off the head piece which was already in a
dilapidated condition an easy matter to muscles like his grasped the
principal rod like a bludgeon and glanced at javert javert retreated
towards the door jean valjean armed with his bar of iron walked
slowly up to fantines couch when he arrived there he turned and said
to javert in a voice that was barely audible
i advise you not to disturb me at this moment
one thing is certain and that is that javert trembled
it did occur to him to summon the guard but jean valjean might avail
himself of that moment to effect his escape so he remained grasped
his cane by the small end and leaned against the door post without
jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed and
his brow on his hand and began to contemplate the motionless body of
fantine which lay extended there he remained thus mute absorbed
evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life
upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible
pity after a few moments of this meditation he bent towards fantine
and spoke to her in a low voice
what did he say to her what could this man who was reproved say to
that woman who was dead what words were those no one on earth heard
them did the dead woman hear them there are some touching illusions
which are perhaps sublime realities the point as to which there
exists no doubt is that sister simplice the sole witness of the
incident often said that at the moment that jean valjean whispered in
fantines ear she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those
pale lips and in those dim eyes filled with the amazement of the tomb
jean valjean took fantines head in both his hands and arranged it on
the pillow as a mother might have done for her child then he tied the
string of her chemise and smoothed her hair back under her cap that
fantines face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment
death that signifies entrance into the great light
fantines hand was hanging over the side of the bed jean valjean knelt
down before that hand lifted it gently and kissed it
now said he i am at your disposal
javert deposited jean valjean in the city prison
the arrest of m madeleine occasioned a sensation or rather an
extraordinary commotion in m sur m we are sorry that we cannot conceal
the fact that at the single word he was a convict nearly every one
deserted him in less than two hours all the good that he had done had
been forgotten and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys it
is just to add that the details of what had taken place at arras were
not yet known all day long conversations like the following were to be
you dont know he was a liberated convict who the mayor bah
m madeleine yes really his name was not madeleine at all he
had a frightful name bejean bojean boujean ah good god he
has been arrested arrested in prison in the city prison while
waiting to be transferred until he is transferred he is to be
transferred where is he to be taken he will be tried at the
assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago well i
suspected as much that man was too good too perfect too affected
he refused the cross he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came
across i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
the drawing rooms particularly abounded in remarks of this nature
one old lady a subscriber to the drapeau blanc made the following
remark the depth of which it is impossible to fathom
i am not sorry it will be a lesson to the bonapartists
it was thus that the phantom which had been called m madeleine vanished
from m sur m only three or four persons in all the town remained
faithful to his memory the old portress who had served him was among
on the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her
lodge still in a thorough fright and absorbed in sad reflections
the factory had been closed all day the carriage gate was bolted the
street was deserted there was no one in the house but the two nuns
sister perpetue and sister simplice who were watching beside the body
towards the hour when m madeleine was accustomed to return home
the good portress rose mechanically took from a drawer the key of
m madeleines chamber and the flat candlestick which he used every
evening to go up to his quarters then she hung the key on the nail
whence he was accustomed to take it and set the candlestick on one
side as though she was expecting him then she sat down again on her
chair and became absorbed in thought once more the poor good old
woman had done all this without being conscious of it
it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from
her revery and exclaimed hold my good god jesus and i hung his key
at that moment the small window in the lodge opened a hand passed
through seized the key and the candlestick and lighted the taper at
the portress raised her eyes and stood there with gaping mouth and a
she knew that hand that arm the sleeve of that coat
it was several seconds before she could speak she had a seizure as she
said herself when she related the adventure afterwards
good god monsieur le maire she cried at last i thought you were 
she stopped the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in
respect towards the beginning jean valjean was still monsieur le maire
in prison said he i was there i broke a bar of one of the windows
i let myself drop from the top of a roof and here i am i am going up
to my room go and find sister simplice for me she is with that poor
he gave her no orders he was quite sure that she would guard him better
no one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard
without opening the big gates he had and always carried about him
a pass key which opened a little side door but he must have been
searched and his latch key must have been taken from him this point
he ascended the staircase leading to his chamber on arriving at the
top he left his candle on the top step of his stairs opened his door
with very little noise went and closed his window and his shutters by
feeling then returned for his candle and re entered his room
it was a useful precaution it will be recollected that his window could
he cast a glance about him at his table at his chair at his bed which
had not been disturbed for three days no trace of the disorder of the
night before last remained the portress had done up his room only
she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two
iron ends of the cudgel and the forty sou piece which had been blackened
he took a sheet of paper on which he wrote these are the two tips of
my iron shod cudgel and the forty sou piece stolen from little gervais
which i mentioned at the court of assizes and he arranged this piece
of paper the bits of iron and the coin in such a way that they were
the first things to be seen on entering the room from a cupboard he
pulled out one of his old shirts which he tore in pieces in the
strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks he
betrayed neither haste nor agitation and while he was wrapping up the
bishops candlesticks he nibbled at a piece of black bread it was
probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight
this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room
when the authorities made an examination later on
she was pale her eyes were red the candle which she carried trembled
in her hand the peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is that
however polished or cool we may be they wring human nature from our
very bowels and force it to reappear on the surface the emotions of
that day had turned the nun into a woman once more she had wept and
jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper which he
handed to the nun saying sister you will give this to monsieur le
the paper was not folded she cast a glance upon it
i beg monsieur le cure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me he
will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial and of the
funeral of the woman who died yesterday the rest is for the poor
the sister tried to speak but she only managed to stammer a few
does not monsieur le maire desire to take a last look at that poor
no said he i am pursued it would only end in their arresting me in
he had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the
staircase they heard a tumult of ascending footsteps and the old
portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones
my good sir i swear to you by the good god that not a soul has
entered this house all day nor all the evening and that i have not
but there is a light in that room nevertheless
the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner
of the wall on the right jean valjean blew out the light and placed
himself in this angle sister simplice fell on her knees near the table
the whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were
the nun did not raise her eyes she was praying
the candle was on the chimney piece and gave but very little light
javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement
it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert his element
the very air he breathed was veneration for all authority this was
impregnable and admitted of neither objection nor restriction in his
eyes of course the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all he
was religious superficial and correct on this point as on all others
in his eyes a priest was a mind who never makes a mistake a nun was a
creature who never sins they were souls walled in from this world
with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass
on perceiving the sister his first movement was to retire
but there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him
imperiously in the opposite direction his second movement was to remain
and to venture on at least one question
this was sister simplice who had never told a lie in her life javert
knew it and held her in special veneration in consequence
sister said he are you alone in this room
a terrible moment ensued during which the poor portress felt as though
then resumed javert you will excuse me if i persist it is my duty
you have not seen a certain person a man this evening he has escaped
we are in search of him that jean valjean you have not seen him
she lied she had lied twice in succession one after the other without
hesitation promptly as a person does when sacrificing herself
pardon me said javert and he retired with a deep bow
o sainted maid you left this world many years ago you have rejoined
your sisters the virgins and your brothers the angels in the light
may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise
the sisters affirmation was for javert so decisive a thing that he did
not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been
extinguished and which was still smoking on the table
an hour later a man marching amid trees and mists was rapidly
departing from m sur m in the direction of paris that man was jean
valjean it has been established by the testimony of two or three
carters who met him that he was carrying a bundle that he was dressed
in a blouse where had he obtained that blouse no one ever found out
but an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days
before leaving behind him nothing but his blouse perhaps that was the
we all have a mother the earth fantine was given back to that mother
the cure thought that he was doing right and perhaps he really was in
reserving as much money as possible from what jean valjean had left for
the poor who was concerned after all a convict and a woman of the
town that is why he had a very simple funeral for fantine and reduced
it to that strictly necessary form known as the paupers grave
so fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs
to anybody and everybody and where the poor are lost fortunately god
knows where to find the soul again fantine was laid in the shade
among the first bones that came to hand she was subjected to the
promiscuousness of ashes she was thrown into the public grave her
chapter i what is met with on the way from nivelles
last year 1861 on a beautiful may morning a traveller the person
who is telling this story was coming from nivelles and directing his
course towards la hulpe he was on foot he was pursuing a broad paved
road which undulated between two rows of trees over the hills which
succeed each other raise the road and let it fall again and produce
he had passed lillois and bois seigneur isaac in the west he perceived
the slate roofed tower of braine lalleud which has the form of a
reversed vase he had just left behind a wood upon an eminence and
at the angle of the cross road by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet
bearing the inscription ancient barrier no 4 a public house bearing
on its front this sign at the four winds aux quatre vents echabeau
a quarter of a league further on he arrived at the bottom of a little
valley where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through
the embankment of the road the clump of sparsely planted but very green
trees which fills the valley on one side of the road is dispersed over
the meadows on the other and disappears gracefully and as in order in
on the right close to the road was an inn with a four wheeled cart
at the door a large bundle of hop poles a plough a heap of dried
brushwood near a flourishing hedge lime smoking in a square hole and
a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions a young
girl was weeding in a field where a huge yellow poster probably of
some outside spectacle such as a parish festival was fluttering in
the wind at one corner of the inn beside a pool in which a flotilla
of ducks was navigating a badly paved path plunged into the bushes the
after traversing a hundred paces skirting a wall of the fifteenth
century surmounted by a pointed gable with bricks set in contrast he
found himself before a large door of arched stone with a rectilinear
impost in the sombre style of louis xiv flanked by two flat
medallions a severe facade rose above this door a wall perpendicular
to the facade almost touched the door and flanked it with an abrupt
right angle in the meadow before the door lay three harrows through
which in disorder grew all the flowers of may the door was closed
the two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old
the sun was charming the branches had that soft shivering of may
which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind a brave
little bird probably a lover was carolling in a distracted manner in a
the wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation
resembling the hollow of a sphere in the stone on the left at the foot
at this moment the leaves of the door parted and a peasant woman
she saw the wayfarer and perceived what he was looking at
it was a french cannon ball which made that she said to him and she
that which you see there higher up in the door near a nail is the
hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg the bullet did not pierce
what is the name of this place inquired the wayfarer
the traveller straightened himself up he walked on a few paces and
went off to look over the tops of the hedges on the horizon through the
trees he perceived a sort of little elevation and on this elevation
something which at that distance resembled a lion
he was on the battle field of waterloo
hougomont this was a funereal spot the beginning of the obstacle
the first resistance which that great wood cutter of europe called
napoleon encountered at waterloo the first knot under the blows of his
it was a chateau it is no longer anything but a farm for the
antiquary hougomont is hugomons this manor was built by hugo sire
of somerel the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the abbey of
the traveller pushed open the door elbowed an ancient calash under the
the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the
sixteenth century which here simulates an arcade everything else
having fallen prostrate around it a monumental aspect often has its
birth in ruin in a wall near the arcade opens another arched door of
the time of henry iv permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard
beside this door a manure hole some pickaxes some shovels some
carts an old well with its flagstone and its iron reel a chicken
jumping and a turkey spreading its tail a chapel surmounted by a small
bell tower a blossoming pear tree trained in espalier against the
wall of the chapel behold the court the conquest of which was one of
napoleons dreams this corner of earth could he but have seized
it would perhaps have given him the world likewise chickens are
scattering its dust abroad with their beaks a growl is audible it is a
huge dog who shows his teeth and replaces the english
the english behaved admirably there cookes four companies of guards
there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army
hougomont viewed on the map as a geometrical plan comprising buildings
and enclosures presents a sort of irregular rectangle one angle of
which is nicked out it is this angle which contains the southern
door guarded by this wall which commands it only a guns length away
hougomont has two doors the southern door that of the chateau and
the northern door belonging to the farm napoleon sent his brother
jerome against hougomont the divisions of foy guilleminot and bachelu
hurled themselves against it nearly the entire corps of reille was
employed against it and miscarried kellermanns balls were exhausted
on this heroic section of wall bauduins brigade was not strong enough
to force hougomont on the north and the brigade of soye could not do
more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south but without
the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south a bit of the north
door broken by the french hangs suspended to the wall it consists of
four planks nailed to two cross beams on which the scars of the attack
the northern door which was beaten in by the french and which has had
a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall stands
half open at the bottom of the paddock it is cut squarely in the wall
built of stone below of brick above which closes in the courtyard on
the north it is a simple door for carts such as exist in all farms
with the two large leaves made of rustic planks beyond lie the meadows
the dispute over this entrance was furious for a long time all sorts
of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door posts it was there
the storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard its horror is
visible there the confusion of the fray was petrified there it lives
and it dies there it was only yesterday the walls are in the death
agony the stones fall the breaches cry aloud the holes are wounds
the drooping quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee
this courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to day buildings
which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles
the english barricaded themselves there the french made their way in
but could not stand their ground beside the chapel one wing of the
chateau the only ruin now remaining of the manor of hougomont rises in
a crumbling state disembowelled one might say the chateau served
for a dungeon the chapel for a block house there men exterminated each
other the french fired on from every point from behind the walls
from the summits of the garrets from the depths of the cellars through
all the casements through all the air holes through every crack in the
stones fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men the reply to the
in the ruined wing through windows garnished with bars of iron the
dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible the
english guards were in ambush in these rooms the spiral of the
staircase cracked from the ground floor to the very roof appears
like the inside of a broken shell the staircase has two stories the
english besieged on the staircase and massed on its upper steps had
cut off the lower steps these consisted of large slabs of blue stone
which form a heap among the nettles half a score of steps still
cling to the wall on the first is cut the figure of a trident these
inaccessible steps are solid in their niches all the rest resembles a
jaw which has been denuded of its teeth there are two old trees there
one is dead the other is wounded at its base and is clothed with
verdure in april since 1815 it has taken to growing through the
a massacre took place in the chapel the interior which has recovered
its calm is singular the mass has not been said there since the
carnage nevertheless the altar has been left there an altar of
unpolished wood placed against a background of roughhewn stone four
whitewashed walls a door opposite the altar two small arched windows
over the door a large wooden crucifix below the crucifix a square
air hole stopped up with a bundle of hay on the ground in one corner
an old window frame with the glass all broken to pieces such is the
chapel near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of saint anne
of the fifteenth century the head of the infant jesus has been carried
off by a large ball the french who were masters of the chapel for a
moment and were then dislodged set fire to it the flames filled this
building it was a perfect furnace the door was burned the floor was
burned the wooden christ was not burned the fire preyed upon his
feet of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen then it
stopped a miracle according to the assertion of the people of the
neighborhood the infant jesus decapitated was less fortunate than the
the walls are covered with inscriptions near the feet of christ this
name is to be read henquinez then these others conde de rio maior
marques y marquesa de almagro habana there are french names with
exclamation points a sign of wrath the wall was freshly whitewashed
in 1849 the nations insulted each other there
it was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which
held an axe in its hand this corpse was sub lieutenant legros
on emerging from the chapel a well is visible on the left there are
two in this courtyard one inquires why is there no bucket and pulley
to this it is because water is no longer drawn there why is water not
drawn there because it is full of skeletons
the last person who drew water from the well was named guillaume van
kylsom he was a peasant who lived at hougomont and was gardener there
on the 18th of june 1815 his family fled and concealed themselves in
the forest surrounding the abbey of villiers sheltered these unfortunate
people who had been scattered abroad for many days and nights there
are at this day certain traces recognizable such as old boles of burned
trees which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the
guillaume van kylsom remained at hougomont to guard the chateau and
concealed himself in the cellar the english discovered him there
they tore him from his hiding place and the combatants forced this
frightened man to serve them by administering blows with the flats of
their swords they were thirsty this guillaume brought them water it
was from this well that he drew it many drank there their last draught
this well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself
after the engagement they were in haste to bury the dead bodies death
has a fashion of harassing victory and she causes the pest to follow
glory the typhus is a concomitant of triumph this well was deep and
it was turned into a sepulchre three hundred dead bodies were cast into
it with too much haste perhaps were they all dead legend says they
were not it seems that on the night succeeding the interment feeble
this well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard three walls part
stone part brick and simulating a small square tower and folded like
the leaves of a screen surround it on all sides the fourth side is
open it is there that the water was drawn the wall at the bottom has
a sort of shapeless loophole possibly the hole made by a shell this
little tower had a platform of which only the beams remain the iron
supports of the well on the right form a cross on leaning over the
eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped up
mass of shadows the base of the walls all about the well is concealed
this well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the
table for all wells in belgium the slab has here been replaced by a
cross beam against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty
and petrified wood which resemble huge bones there is no longer either
pail chain or pulley but there is still the stone basin which served
the overflow the rain water collects there and from time to time a
bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink and then flies
away one house in this ruin the farmhouse is still inhabited the
door of this house opens on the courtyard upon this door beside a
pretty gothic lock plate there is an iron handle with trefoils placed
slanting at the moment when the hanoverian lieutenant wilda grasped
this handle in order to take refuge in the farm a french sapper hewed
the family who occupy the house had for their grandfather guillaume van
kylsom the old gardener dead long since a woman with gray hair said
to us i was there i was three years old my sister who was older
was terrified and wept they carried us off to the woods i went there
in my mothers arms we glued our ears to the earth to hear i imitated
a door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard so
it is in three parts one might almost say in three acts the first
part is a garden the second is an orchard the third is a wood these
three parts have a common enclosure on the side of the entrance the
buildings of the chateau and the farm on the left a hedge on the
right a wall and at the end a wall the wall on the right is of
brick the wall at the bottom is of stone one enters the garden first
it slopes downwards is planted with gooseberry bushes choked with a
wild growth of vegetation and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut
it was a seignorial garden in the first french style which preceded le
notre to day it is ruins and briars the pilasters are surmounted by
globes which resemble cannon balls of stone forty three balusters can
still be counted on their sockets the rest lie prostrate in the grass
almost all bear scratches of bullets one broken baluster is placed on
it was in this garden further down than the orchard that six
light infantry men of the 1st having made their way thither and being
unable to escape hunted down and caught like bears in their dens
accepted the combat with two hanoverian companies one of which was
armed with carbines the hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired
from above the infantry men replying from below six against two
hundred intrepid and with no shelter save the currant bushes took a
one mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard
properly speaking there within the limits of those few square fathoms
fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour the wall seems ready
to renew the combat thirty eight loopholes pierced by the english at
irregular heights are there still in front of the sixth are placed two
english tombs of granite there are loopholes only in the south wall as
the principal attack came from that quarter the wall is hidden on the
outside by a tall hedge the french came up thinking that they had to
deal only with a hedge crossed it and found the wall both an obstacle
and an ambuscade with the english guards behind it the thirty eight
loopholes firing at once a shower of grape shot and balls and soyes
brigade was broken against it thus waterloo began
nevertheless the orchard was taken as they had no ladders the french
scaled it with their nails they fought hand to hand amid the trees
all this grass has been soaked in blood a battalion of nassau seven
hundred strong was overwhelmed there the outside of the wall against
which kellermanns two batteries were trained is gnawed by grape shot
this orchard is sentient like others in the month of may it has its
buttercups and its daisies the grass is tall there the cart horses
browse there cords of hair on which linen is drying traverse the
spaces between the trees and force the passer by to bend his head one
walks over this uncultivated land and ones foot dives into mole holes
in the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree bole which lies
there all verdant major blackmann leaned against it to die beneath
a great tree in the neighborhood fell the german general duplat
descended from a french family which fled on the revocation of the edict
of nantes an aged and falling apple tree leans far over to one side
its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam nearly all
the apple trees are falling with age there is not one which has not
had its bullet or its biscayan6 the skeletons of dead trees abound in
this orchard crows fly through their branches and at the end of it is
bauduin killed foy wounded conflagration massacre carnage a
rivulet formed of english blood french blood german blood mingled
in fury a well crammed with corpses the regiment of nassau and the
regiment of brunswick destroyed duplat killed blackmann killed the
english guards mutilated twenty french battalions besides the forty
from reilles corps decimated three thousand men in that hovel of
hougomont alone cut down slashed to pieces shot burned with their
throats cut and all this so that a peasant can say to day to the
traveller monsieur give me three francs and if you like i will
let us turn back that is one of the story tellers rights and put
ourselves once more in the year 1815 and even a little earlier than
the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took
if it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of
june 1815 the fate of europe would have been different a few drops
of water more or less decided the downfall of napoleon all that
providence required in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz
was a little more rain and a cloud traversing the sky out of season
the battle of waterloo could not be begun until half past eleven
oclock and that gave blucher time to come up why because the ground
was wet the artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer
napoleon was an artillery officer and felt the effects of this the
foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who in the report to
the directory on aboukir said such a one of our balls killed six men
all his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles the key to his
victory was to make the artillery converge on one point he treated the
strategy of the hostile general like a citadel and made a breach in it
he overwhelmed the weak point with grape shot he joined and dissolved
battles with cannon there was something of the sharpshooter in his
genius to beat in squares to pulverize regiments to break lines to
crush and disperse masses for him everything lay in this to
strike strike strike incessantly and he intrusted this task to the
cannon ball a redoubtable method and one which united with genius
rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the
on the 18th of june 1815 he relied all the more on his artillery
because he had numbers on his side wellington had only one hundred and
fifty nine mouths of fire napoleon had two hundred and forty
suppose the soil dry and the artillery capable of moving the action
would have begun at six oclock in the morning the battle would have
been won and ended at two oclock three hours before the change of
fortune in favor of the prussians what amount of blame attaches to
napoleon for the loss of this battle is the shipwreck due to the pilot
was it the evident physical decline of napoleon that complicated this
epoch by an inward diminution of force had the twenty years of war worn
out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul as well as the body
did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader in a word
was this genius as many historians of note have thought suffering from
an eclipse did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened
powers from himself did he begin to waver under the delusion of
a breath of adventure had he become a grave matter in a
general unconscious of peril is there an age in this class of
material great men who may be called the giants of action when genius
grows short sighted old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal
for the dantes and michael angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness
is it to grow less for the hannibals and the bonapartes had napoleon
lost the direct sense of victory had he reached the point where he
could no longer recognize the reef could no longer divine the snare no
longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses had he lost his power of
scenting out catastrophes he who had in former days known all the
roads to triumph and who from the summit of his chariot of lightning
pointed them out with a sovereign finger had he now reached that
state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions
harnessed to it to the precipice was he seized at the age of forty six
with a supreme madness was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer
his plan of battle was by the confession of all a masterpiece to
go straight to the centre of the allies line to make a breach in the
enemy to cut them in two to drive the british half back on hal
and the prussian half on tongres to make two shattered fragments of
wellington and blucher to carry mont saint jean to seize brussels
to hurl the german into the rhine and the englishman into the sea all
this was contained in that battle according to napoleon afterwards
of course we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of
