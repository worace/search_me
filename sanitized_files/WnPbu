the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson
count be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into some
corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be
before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
oh yes yes yes said the count hastily i shall be very pleased
very pleased vasilich youll see to it just unload one or two carts
well what of it do whats necessary said the count muttering
but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officers
face had already sealed the order the count looked around him in the
yard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers and
their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count and
please step into the gallery your excellency said the major domo
the count went into the house with him repeating his order not to
refuse the wounded who asked for a lift
well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a
soft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheard
at nine oclock the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who had
been her ladys maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
chief gendarmes duty for her came to say that madame schoss was much
offended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behind
on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because
her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads were
being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
that they should take with them the countess sent for her husband
what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded
you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer
came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are
things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
them really now in our own yard we asked them in ourselves and
there are officers among them you know i think my dear let them
the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters
the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
something detrimental to the childrens interests such as the building
of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theater
or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced
in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so
she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband
listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are getting
nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all our all the
childrens property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
rubles worth of things in the house i dont consent my dear i dont
do as you please its the governments business to look after the
wounded they know that look at the lopukhins opposite they cleared
out everything two days ago thats what other people do its only we
who are such fools if you have no pity on me have some for the
flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
papa what are you doing that for asked natasha who had followed him
nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily
but i heard said natasha why does mamma object
what business is it of yours cried the count
natasha stepped up to the window and pondered
papa heres berg coming to see us said she looking out of the
berg the rostovs son in law was already a colonel wearing the orders
of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army
he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the
army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there
so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
berg drove up to his father in laws house in his spruce little trap
with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he
looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it
from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the
drawing room where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natasha
and sonya and hastened to inquire after mammas health
health at a time like this said the count come tell us the news
is the army retreating or will there be another battle
god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa said
berg the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders so
to say have now assembled in council no one knows what is coming but
in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit the truly
antique valor of the russian army which they which it he corrected
himself has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty sixth
there are no words worthy to do it justice i tell you papa he smote
himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done but
berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the
words russian army i tell you frankly that we the commanders far
from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly
restrain those those yes those exploits of antique valor he
went on rapidly general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at
the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed on a
and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
heard those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some
altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot
be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round at
natasha and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her intent
look with a smile russia is not in moscow she lives in the hearts of
her sons isnt it so papa said he
just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and
dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand
asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side to
yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for
every russian but why are you so anxious you have still time to get
i cant think what the servants are about said the countess turning
to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready yet
somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such times
the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself
he got up from his chair and went to the door
at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking his head sadly and
and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he
i was driving past yusupovs house just now said berg with a laugh
when the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether i wouldnt
buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a
small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear vera wanted a
chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention
of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone
to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements and its
such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you know
and dear vera has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise you
see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let me
have one i will pay the man well and
if its inconvenient please dont said berg only i so wanted it
oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil
cried the old count my heads in a whirl
and he left the room the countess began to cry
yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg
natasha left the room with her father and as if finding it difficult to
reach some decision first followed him and then ran downstairs
petya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the servants
who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in the
yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing
into one of them helped by an orderly
do you know what its about petya asked natasha
she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about
its because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said
i consider natasha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to
petya i consider it so horrid so abominable so i dont know what
her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and
letting the force of her anger run to waste she turned and rushed
berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
attention of a relative the count pipe in hand was pacing up and down
the room when natasha her face distorted by anger burst in like a
tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps
its horrid its abominable she screamed you cant possibly have
berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the count
mamma its impossible see what is going on in the yard she cried
whats the matter with you who are they what do you want
why the wounded its impossible mamma its monstrous no mamma
darling its not the thing please forgive me darling mamma what
does it matter what we take away only look what is going on in the
the count stood by the window and listened without turning round
suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window
the countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her
mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn
to look at her now and she glanced round quite disconcerted
oh do as you like am i hindering anyone she said not surrendering
but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband
my dear you order what is right you know i dont understand about
the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count through
tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha we will still
the count nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at which
she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the
the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange
order she brought them until the count himself in his wifes name
confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants
set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed
strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
away but that had seemed the only thing to do
the whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set
eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts the
wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread
to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into the
rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts
but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work of
unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter
whether all or only half the things were left behind cases full of
china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed
the night before now lay about the yard and still they went on
searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
letting the wounded have another and yet another cart
we can take four more men said the steward they can have my trap
or else what is to become of them
let them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can go
they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
house two doors off the whole household servants included was bright
and animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she
what could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a
trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at least
leave it vasilich will put it away its not wanted
the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count
on the box youll sit on the box wont you petya cried natasha
sonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quite
different from natashas she was putting away the things that had to be
left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and she
tried to get as much taken away with them as possible
before two oclock in the afternoon the rostovs four carriages packed
full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by one
the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard
the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sonyas
attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was
arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage
why didnt you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince he
spent the night in our house and is going with us
its our intended that was prince bolkonski himself they say he is
sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess
tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was
pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to
assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting
mamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is
the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing sonyas arm glanced
at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them
they knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard
this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked
natasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonya
the countess put her arms around sonya and began to cry
the ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that the
almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was
well mamma everything is ready whats the matter asked natasha as
with animated face she ran into the room
nothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us start
and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sonya
is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha with
sonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss mavra
kuzminichna and vasilich came into the drawing room and having closed
the doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
the count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himself
before the icon all the others did the same then the count embraced
mavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and while
they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the
countess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her knees
before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall
the most precious ones with which some family tradition was connected
in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swords
and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts
and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind
as is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in
the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each
side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the
countess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house
to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again
they always will forget everything said the countess dont you know
and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an
aggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
oh those servants said the count swaying his head
efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to
drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance
round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he
knew it would be some time yet before the order be off in gods
name would be given him and he knew that even when it was said he
would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be
stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all
this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more
patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon
who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated
the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut
somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and
said what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat and
began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the
same off in gods name said efim putting on his hat start the
postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar
the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman
sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of
the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their
turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the
carriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they
passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow
walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off
rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in
the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls
of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the
carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see
the raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did not know who was in
it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
caleche she knew it was right in front
in kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets came
several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs and as they
passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows
as they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was
inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
look yes on my word its bezukhov said natasha putting her head
out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a coachmans
long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a
gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the
sukharev tower accompanied by a small sallow faced beardless old man
yes it really is bezukhov in a coachmans coat with a queer looking
no its not he how can you talk such nonsense
mamma screamed natasha ill stake my head its he i assure you
but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street came
more carts and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to move
in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostovs
all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a coachmans
coat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a
small beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed
a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and
respectfully touching pierres elbow said something to him and pointed
to the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at
first understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the
direction the old man indicated he recognized natasha and following
his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but
having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped
natashas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical
peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this is
wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing
pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked
along beside her while the coach still moved on
what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and
what what why dont ask me said pierre and looked round at
natasha whose radiant happy expression of which he was conscious
without looking at her filled him with enchantment
in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow good bye
ah if only i were a man id certainly stay with you how splendid
said natasha mamma if youll let me ill stay
pierre glanced absently at natasha and was about to say something but
yes i was pierre answered there will be another battle
but what is the matter with you count you are not like yourself
oh dont ask me dont ask me i dont know myself tomorrow but
no good bye good by he muttered its an awful time and dropping
behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement
natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming at
him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile
for the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living
in the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how it
when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his
interview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make out
where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that
among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman
who had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene he felt
suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which
he was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all
was in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or
wrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from this
position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first sat
down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the door
of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing
his arms and took up a book his major domo came in a second time to
say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was
very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from
bazdeevs widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her husbands
books as she herself was leaving for the country
oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will
come directly pierre replied to the major domo
but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which
was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door
there was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of this
passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with both
hands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter was
standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood there
was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that
staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were
some carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate
the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich
which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head
and quickening his pace went down the street
of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph
bazdeevs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary
he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
patriarchs ponds where the widow bazdeevs house was
continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were
making their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky
body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre
experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began to
the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin
and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills
gates and a great battle would be fought there
having reached the patriarchs ponds pierre found the bazdeevs house
where he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gate
gerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five
years before with joseph bazdeev came out in answer to his knock
owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the
i will come in all the same i have to look through the books said
be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my late
master may the kingdom of heaven be his has remained here but he is
in a weak state as you know said the old servant
pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeevs half insane
yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the house
a tall bald headed old man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and
with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre
he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage
he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your honor
sees said gerasim will you step into the study pierre nodded as
it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia danilovna gave orders
that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books
pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
trepidation in his benefactors lifetime the room dusty and untouched
since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier
gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe pierre
went round the study approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts
were kept and took out what had once been one of the most important
the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts with
bazdeevs notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing
table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out
closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand
gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre
more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a
slight noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did not
is the cabman to be discharged your honor
oh yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly look
here he added taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down
at the old man with moist shining and ecstatic eyes i say do you
know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow
i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you
yes your excellency replied gerasim will you have something to
no but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol
yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment
all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactors study
and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him
gerasim being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things
accepted pierres taking up his residence in the house without surprise
and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same evening
without even asking himself what they were wanted for he procured a
coachmans coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol
next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in
his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at
pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing
gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away it
was when pierre wearing the coachmans coat which gerasim had procured
for him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man to
buy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs
kutuzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued
the first troops started at once and during the night they marched
slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing
the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side
and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were
bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
overcame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to
the fords and the boats kutuzov himself had driven round by side
by ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rear
guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the
main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it
at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september
napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at
the panorama spread out before him from the twenty sixth of august to
the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the
entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating
memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and
refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are
warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and
delight us continually by falling from the sky
at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still
the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonny
hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her
churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas
the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he
had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and
uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force
of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance
distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonny
hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the
every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every
foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the
mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it
cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte la
voila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps  said he and
dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and
 that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it
is then at last that famous city it was high time
a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor
thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of
view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed
strange to him that his long felt wish which had seemed unattainable
had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at
the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance
but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my
feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange
beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what
light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here
she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected
glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient
capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to
descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but
no it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet
here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses
scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on
the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great
words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel
most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief
import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
himself and alexander from the height of the kremlin yes there is
the kremlin yes i will give them just laws i will teach them the
meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember
their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not
and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false
policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in
moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i
do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire
the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their
presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do
clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in
quon mamene les boyars  said he to his suite
a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to
the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that
speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it
he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would
mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts
of the people having learned that there were many charitable
institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors
on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose
and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars
and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russians and being like
all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference
to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere  he decided that he would
place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this
establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be
simply maison de ma mere 2 he concluded but am i really in
moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the
meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to
fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty
that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring
together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that
moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact
seemed but by the question how to tell the emperor without putting
him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous that he had been
awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left
in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must
be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that
the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then
he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the
the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon
his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the
outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under
his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile
but its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging
their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le
at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinct
suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out
was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single
report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already
spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through
tver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with one
another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the
clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as
the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his
horse paced for a long time by the kammer kollezski rampart awaiting
meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a
fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty
it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty
in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of
honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one
has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any
life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound
that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the beekeepers tap on the
wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming
of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead
of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm
whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the
alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the
hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity
like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of
disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from
danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they
flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower
part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy bees tamed by
toil clinging to one anothers legs and drawing out the wax with a
ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the
floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in
various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a
neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings
there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees
scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared
the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super
instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the
combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected
and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about
the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they
were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers
having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps
and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their
flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey
an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of
bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with
efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or
bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees
are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another
without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack
some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or
killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap
of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the
brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by
thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of
generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of
bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary they
had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only
a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the enemys
hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall
as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark
on it and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean
so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and
morose paced up and down in front of the kammer kollezski rampart
awaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance of
in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was
empty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently
he took his seat beside the aide de camp on duty and drove into the
suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible
he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov
the coup de theatre had not come off
the russian troops were passing through moscow from two oclock at night
till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the
the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
while the troops dividing into two parts when passing around the
kremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great many
soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion turned back
from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
vasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the hill to
the red square where some instinct told them they could easily take
things not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
filled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were no
dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to
enter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of female
purchasers but only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though without
muskets entering the bazaar empty handed and silently making their way
out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants
of whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quite
bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them up again and
themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants on the
square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call but
