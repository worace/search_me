captured with the hand with our hand we immortalize what cannot live
and fly much longer things only which are exhausted and mellow and it
is only for your afternoon you my written and painted thoughts for
which alone i have colours many colours perhaps many variegated
softenings and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds but
nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning you sudden
sparks and marvels of my solitude you my old beloved evil thoughts
uneaseful joy to look to lurk to hark
i peer for friends am ready day and night
where linger ye my friends the time is right
is not the glaciers grey today for you
the brooklet seeks you wind cloud with longing thread
and thrust themselves yet higher to the blue
to spy for you from farthest eagles view
my table was spread out for you on high
star near so near the grisly pit below
friends ye are there woe me yet i am not
ye stare and stop better your wrath could speak
i am not i hand gait face changed and what
i am to you my friends now am i not
am i an other strange am i to me
a wrestler by himself too oft self wrung
i sought where so the wind blows keenest there
where no man dwells on lonesome ice lorn fell
and unlearned man and god and curse and prayer
ye my old friends look ye turn pale filled oer
go yet not in wrath ye could neer live here
here in the farthest realm of ice and scaur
a huntsman must one be like chamois soar
an evil huntsman was i see how taut
strongest was he by whom such bolt were sent
woe now that arrow is with peril fraught
perilous as none have yon safe home ye sought
ye go thou didst endure enough oh heart
wast thou young then now better young thou art
what linked us once together one hopes tie
those lines now fading love once wrote thereon
is like a parchment which the hand is shy
to touch like crackling leaves all seared all dry
oh friends no more they are what name for those
knocking at my hearts window pane at night
gazing on me that speaks we were and goes
oh withered words once fragrant as the rose
which i deemed changed with me kin of my kind
but they grew old and thus were doomed and banned
none but new kith are native of my land
unrestful joy to long to lurk to hark
i peer for friends am ready day and night
for my new friends come come the time is right
this song is done the sweet sad cry of rue
a wizard wrought it he the timely friend
the midday friend no do not ask me who
at midday twas when one became as two
we keep our feast of feasts sure of our bourne
the world now laughs the grisly veil was torn
and light and dark were one that wedding morn
