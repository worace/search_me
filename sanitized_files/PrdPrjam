i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner
which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without
reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the
claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any
possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the
resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former
were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments
concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well
i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your
ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you
reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave
of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve
no such attention i am most seriously displeased
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go
she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously
civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were
well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through
meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it
appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report
of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley
and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply
the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours
at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the
collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it
was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would
address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would
probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often
seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady
catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand
it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his
constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might
have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had
been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject
the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her
father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it
might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its
contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins
from mr collins and what can he have to say
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of
which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping
lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on
this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another
of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive
patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin
elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine
that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have
surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force
one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she
felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad
business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an
encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should
very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them
as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian
forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes
situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you
look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish
i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we
live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so
yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate
writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any
consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine
about this report did she call to refuse her consent
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by
his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of
his seeing too little she might have fancied too much
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines
visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed
their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the
habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five
set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others
to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy
were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon
maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was
mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise
and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a
mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could
not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again
in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your
family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause
her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your
feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not
very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him
but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of
feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to
be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through
london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that
had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your
accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was
unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined
will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i
then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of
it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your
reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can
scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time
i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at
all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you
think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was
necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part
especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the
power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the
adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now
so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some
of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of
innocence but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude
which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish
being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i
was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i
was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt
by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all
that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family
circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i
was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been
but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you
taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you
i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
had you then persuaded yourself that i should
indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure
you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me
wrong how you must have hated me after that evening
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due
my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in
my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to
obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know
anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with
their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth
not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen
that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and
though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a
confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had
the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent
to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him
that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring
from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made here and i was convinced of her affection
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to
it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess
one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was
angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked
herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at
and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness
of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he
continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room
and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to
say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything
the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth
and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy
than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment
there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no
one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away
at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far
from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here
you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no
you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and
i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am
in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are
jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as
these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever
miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried
jane my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you
certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased
jane shall you like to have such a brother
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you
really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than
marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am
my dearest sister now be serious i want to talk very seriously let
me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the
desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself
i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you
i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your
husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but
lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling
to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next
morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or
other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and
shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information
and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk
to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went
up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying
i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is
all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking
to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be
asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she
were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw
mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to
be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she
his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched
reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when
looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he
wants you in the library she was gone directly
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man have not you always hated him
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give
but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be
sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but
this would be nothing if you really liked him
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him
indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not
know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind
of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he
condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on
having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know
your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked
up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and
at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object
of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months
suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did
conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to
say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing
made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him
his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble
and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her
at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come
for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for
gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her
and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary
for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to
utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in
her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would
have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich
and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages
you will have janes is nothing to it nothing at all i am so
pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my
dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i
hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing
that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh
lord what will become of me i shall go distracted
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and
elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself
soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten
thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a
special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but
my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations
consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to
him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
i admire all my three sons in law highly said he wickham perhaps
is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could
you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which
laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere
for the liveliness of your mind i did
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious
attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and
interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it
by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first
called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did
you look as if you did not care about me
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you
would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect
too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady
catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me
hope and i was determined at once to know every thing
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy
for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to
netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed
or had you intended any more serious consequence
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i
might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to
myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley
and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
i am more likely to want more time than courage elizabeth but it
ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners
long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done
for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the
truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed
but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your
fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you
cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again
for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your
idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i
am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so
before but not one with such justice i am happier even than jane she
only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still
different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply
i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon
be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her
former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was
affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information
was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that
charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even
listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did
shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight
mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her sister stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good
humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all
likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it
added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride
she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may
be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible
amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in
going to pemberley especially when he was least expected
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source
of happiness were within thirty miles of each other
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally
known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example
she became by proper attention and management less irritable less
ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias
society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of
balls and young men her father would never consent to her going
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite
unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every
thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least
if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this
i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear
wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so
rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however
do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not
