let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward
the prisoner of the ruffians m leblanc m urbain fabre the father of
the door was guarded but the window was not as soon as he had found
himself released from his bonds and while javert was drawing up his
report he had taken advantage of confusion the crowd the darkness
and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him to
an agent sprang to the opening and looked out he saw no one outside
the devil ejaculated javert between his teeth he must have been the
chapter xxii the little one who was crying in volume two
on the day following that on which these events took place in the house
on the boulevard de lhopital a child who seemed to be coming from the
direction of the bridge of austerlitz was ascending the side alley on
the right in the direction of the barriere de fontainebleau
this lad was pale thin clad in rags with linen trousers in the month
of february and was singing at the top of his voice
at the corner of the rue du petit banquier a bent old woman was
rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern the
child jostled her as he passed then recoiled exclaiming
hello and i took it for an enormous enormous dog
he pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell
of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals an
the old woman straightened herself up in a fury
nasty brat she grumbled if i hadnt been bending over i know well
where i would have planted my foot on you
kisss kisss he cried after that i dont think i was mistaken
the old woman choking with indignation now rose completely upright
and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face all
hollowed into angles and wrinkles with crows feet meeting the corners
her body was lost in the darkness and only her head was visible one
would have pronounced her a mask of decrepitude carved out by a light
madame said he does not possess that style of beauty which pleases
he then pursued his road and resumed his song
at the end of these three lines he paused he had arrived in front of
no 50 52 and finding the door fastened he began to assault it with
resounding and heroic kicks which betrayed rather the mans shoes that
he was wearing than the childs feet which he owned
in the meanwhile the very old woman whom he had encountered at the
corner of the rue du petit banquier hastened up behind him uttering
clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures
whats this whats this lord god hes battering the door down hes
is that the way buildings are treated nowadays
why its the old lady said the lad good day bougonmuche i have
the old woman retorted with a composite grimace and a wonderful
improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness
the lad scratched his head behind his ear stared at maam bougon and
then he executed a pirouette on his heel a moment later the old woman
who had remained on the door step heard him singing in his clear young
voice as he plunged under the black elm trees in the wintry wind
the idyl in the rue plumet and the epic in the rue saint denis
1831 and 1832 the two years which are immediately connected with the
revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments
of history these two years rise like two mountains midway between those
which precede and those which follow them they have a revolutionary
grandeur precipices are to be distinguished there the social masses
the very assizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and
adhering interests the century old profiles of the ancient french
formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm
clouds of systems of passions and of theories these appearances
and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance
at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried
this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to
be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal
the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases hard to
define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult
and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a
these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to
convert them to profit in the beginning the nation asks nothing but
repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition
to be small which is the translation of remaining tranquil of great
events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we
have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads we would
exchange caesar for prusias and napoleon for the king of yvetot what
a good little king was he we have marched since daybreak we have
reached the evening of a long and toilsome day we have made our first
change with mirabeau the second with robespierre the third with
bonaparte we are worn out each one demands a bed
devotion which is weary heroism which has grown old ambitions which
are sated fortunes which are made seek demand implore solicit
what a shelter they have it they take possession of peace of
tranquillity of leisure behold they are content but at the same
time certain facts arise compel recognition and knock at the door in
their turn these facts are the products of revolutions and wars they
are they exist they have the right to install themselves in society
and they do install themselves therein and most of the time facts
are the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but
this then is what appears to philosophical politicians
at the same time that weary men demand repose accomplished facts demand
guarantees guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men
this is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector this
is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
these guarantees are a necessity of the times they must be accorded
princes grant them but in reality it is the force of things which
gives them a profound truth and one useful to know which the stuarts
did not suspect in 1662 and which the bourbons did not even obtain a
the predestined family which returned to france when napoleon fell had
the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed and
that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the house of
bourbon possessed the right divine that france possessed nothing and
that the political right conceded in the charter of louis xviii was
merely a branch of the right divine was detached by the house of
bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should
please the king to reassume it still the house of bourbon should have
felt from the displeasure created by the gift that it did not come
this house was churlish to the nineteenth century it put on an
ill tempered look at every development of the nation to make use of a
trivial word that is to say of a popular and a true word it looked
it thought it possessed strength because the empire had been carried
away before it like a theatrical stage setting it did not perceive that
it had itself been brought in in the same fashion it did not perceive
that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon
it thought that it had roots because it was the past it was mistaken
it formed a part of the past but the whole past was france the roots
of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nations
these obscure and lively roots constituted not the right of a family
but the history of a people they were everywhere except under the
the house of bourbon was to france the illustrious and bleeding knot in
her history but was no longer the principal element of her destiny
and the necessary base of her politics she could get along without the
bourbons she had done without them for two and twenty years there
had been a break of continuity they did not suspect the fact and how
should they have suspected it they who fancied that louis xvii reigned
on the 9th of thermidor and that louis xviii was reigning at the
battle of marengo never since the origin of history had princes been
so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority
which facts contain and promulgate never had that pretension here below
which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from
a capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the
guarantees granted in 1814 on the concessions as it termed them
sad a sad thing what it termed its concessions were our conquests
what it termed our encroachments were our rights
when the hour seemed to it to have come the restoration supposing
itself victorious over bonaparte and well rooted in the country that is
to say believing itself to be strong and deep abruptly decided on its
plan of action and risked its stroke one morning it drew itself up
before the face of france and elevating its voice it contested the
collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty
of the citizen to liberty in other words it denied to the nation
that which made it a nation and to the citizen that which made him a
this is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the
it fell justly but we admit it had not been absolutely hostile to
all forms of progress great things had been accomplished with it
under the restoration the nation had grown accustomed to calm
discussion which had been lacking under the republic and to grandeur
in peace which had been wanting under the empire france free and
strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of
europe the revolution had had the word under robespierre the cannon
had had the word under bonaparte it was under louis xviii and charles
x that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word the wind
ceased the torch was lighted once more on the lofty heights the
pure light of mind could be seen flickering a magnificent useful and
charming spectacle for a space of fifteen years those great principles
which are so old for the thinker so new for the statesman could be
seen at work in perfect peace on the public square equality before the
law liberty of conscience liberty of speech liberty of the press the
accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions thus it proceeded until
1830 the bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the
the fall of the bourbons was full of grandeur not on their side but
on the side of the nation they quitted the throne with gravity but
without authority their descent into the night was not one of those
solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history it
was neither the spectral calm of charles i nor the eagle scream of
napoleon they departed that is all they laid down the crown and
retained no aureole they were worthy but they were not august they
lacked in a certain measure the majesty of their misfortune charles
x during the voyage from cherbourg causing a round table to be cut
over into a square table appeared to be more anxious about imperilled
etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy this diminution saddened
devoted men who loved their persons and serious men who honored their
race the populace was admirable the nation attacked one morning with
weapons by a sort of royal insurrection felt itself in the possession
of so much force that it did not go into a rage it defended itself
restrained itself restored things to their places the government to
law the bourbons to exile alas and then halted it took the old king
charles x from beneath that dais which had sheltered louis xiv and
set him gently on the ground it touched the royal personages only with
sadness and precaution it was not one man it was not a few men it
was france france entire france victorious and intoxicated with her
victory who seemed to be coming to herself and who put into practice
before the eyes of the whole world these grave words of guillaume du
it is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the
great and to spring like a bird from bough to bough from an afflicted
fortune to a flourishing one to show themselves harsh towards their
prince in his adversity but as for me the fortune of my kings and
especially of my afflicted kings will always be venerable to me
the bourbons carried away with them respect but not regret as we have
just stated their misfortune was greater than they were they faded out
the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the
entire world the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm the
others turned away each according to his nature at the first blush
the princes of europe the owls of this dawn shut their eyes wounded
and stupefied and only opened them to threaten a fright which can be
comprehended a wrath which can be pardoned this strange revolution had
hardly produced a shock it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the
honor of treating it as an enemy and of shedding its blood in the eyes
of despotic governments who are always interested in having liberty
calumniate itself the revolution of july committed the fault of being
formidable and of remaining gentle nothing however was attempted or
plotted against it the most discontented the most irritated the most
trembling saluted it whatever our egotism and our rancor may be a
mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the
collaboration of some one who is working above man
the revolution of july is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact a
right overthrowing the fact hence the brilliancy of the revolution of
1830 hence also its mildness right triumphant has no need of being
the property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure the
fact even when most necessary to all appearances even when most
thoroughly accepted by contemporaries if it exist only as a fact and
if it contain only too little of right or none at all is infallibly
destined to become in the course of time deformed impure perhaps
even monstrous if one desires to learn at one blow to what degree of
hideousness the fact can attain viewed at the distance of centuries
let him look at machiavelli machiavelli is not an evil genius nor a
demon nor a miserable and cowardly writer he is nothing but the fact
and he is not only the italian fact he is the european fact the
fact of the sixteenth century he seems hideous and so he is in the
presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth
this conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin
of society to terminate this duel to amalgamate the pure idea with the
humane reality to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact
and the fact into right that is the task of sages
but the task of sages is one thing the task of clever men is another
the revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt
as soon as a revolution has made the coast the skilful make haste to
the skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of
statesmen so that this word statesmen has ended by becoming somewhat
of a slang word it must be borne in mind in fact that wherever
there is nothing but skill there is necessarily pettiness to say the
in the same way to say statesmen is sometimes equivalent to saying
traitors if then we are to believe the skilful revolutions like
the revolution of july are severed arteries a prompt ligature is
indispensable the right too grandly proclaimed is shaken also right
once firmly fixed the state must be strengthened liberty once assured
here the sages are not as yet separated from the skilful but they
begin to be distrustful power very good but in the first place what
is power in the second whence comes it the skilful do not seem to
hear the murmured objection and they continue their manoeuvres
according to the politicians who are ingenious in putting the mask
of necessity on profitable fictions the first requirement of a people
after a revolution when this people forms part of a monarchical
continent is to procure for itself a dynasty in this way say they
peace that is to say time to dress our wounds and to repair
the house can be had after a revolution the dynasty conceals the
scaffolding and covers the ambulance now it is not always easy to
if it is absolutely necessary the first man of genius or even the first
man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a
king you have in the first case napoleon in the second iturbide
but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a
dynasty there is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in
a race and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised
if we place ourselves at the point of view of the statesmen after
making all allowances of course after a revolution what are the
qualities of the king which result from it he may be and it is useful
for him to be a revolutionary that is to say a participant in his own
person in that revolution that he should have lent a hand to it that
he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein that
he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it
what are the qualities of a dynasty it should be national that is to
say revolutionary at a distance not through acts committed but by
reason of ideas accepted it should be composed of past and be historic
all this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with
finding a man cromwell or napoleon and why the second absolutely
insisted on finding a family the house of brunswick or the house of
royal houses resemble those indian fig trees each branch of which
bending over to the earth takes root and becomes a fig tree itself
each branch may become a dynasty on the sole condition that it shall
here then lies the great art to make a little render to success the
sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble
from it also to season with fear every step that is taken to augment
the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress to dull
that aurora to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm to
cut all angles and nails to wad triumph to muffle up right to envelop
the giant people in flannel and to put it to bed very speedily to
impose a diet on that excess of health to put hercules on the treatment
of a convalescent to dilute the event with the expedient to offer to
spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion
to take ones precautions against too much success to garnish the
1830 practised this theory already applied to england by 1688
1830 is a revolution arrested midway half of progress quasi right
now logic knows not the almost absolutely as the sun knows not the
because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction
yesterday it was appetite to day it is plenitude to morrow it will be
the phenomenon of 1814 after napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after
the attempt has been made and wrongly to make a class of the
bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the
people the bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down a chair
but through a desire to sit down too soon one may arrest the very march
of the human race this has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie
one is not a class because one has committed a fault selfishness is not
one of the divisions of the social order
moreover we must be just to selfishness the state to which that part
of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock
of 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and
laziness and which contains a little shame it was not the slumber
which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams it was
the halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory
sense a troop on the march that is to say movement a stand that is
the halt is the restoration of forces it is repose armed and on the
alert it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds
the halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of
it is the partition between 1830 and 1848
what we here call combat may also be designated as progress
the bourgeoisie then as well as the statesmen required a man who
should express this word halt an although because a composite
individuality signifying revolution and signifying stability in other
terms strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the
this man was already found his name was louis philippe dorleans
the 221 made louis philippe king lafayette undertook the coronation
he called it the best of republics the town hall of paris took the
this substitution of a half throne for a whole throne was the work of
when the skilful had finished the immense vice of their solution became
apparent all this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute
right absolute right cried i protest then terrible to say it
revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand they strike firmly and
choose well even incomplete even debased and abused and reduced to the
state of a junior revolution like the revolution of 1830 they nearly
always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from
falling amiss their eclipse is never an abdication
nevertheless let us not boast too loudly revolutions also may be
let us return to 1830 1830 in its deviation had good luck in the
establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been
cut short the king amounted to more than royalty louis philippe was a
the son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating
circumstances but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of
blame possessing all private virtues and many public virtues careful
of his health of his fortune of his person of his affairs knowing
the value of a minute and not always the value of a year sober serene
peaceable patient a good man and a good prince sleeping with his
wife and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing
the conjugal bed to the bourgeois an ostentation of the regular
sleeping apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate
displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages of europe and
what is more rare all the languages of all interests and speaking
them an admirable representative of the middle class but
outstripping it and in every way greater than it possessing excellent
sense while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung counting
most of all on his intrinsic worth and on the question of his race
very particular declaring himself orleans and not bourbon thoroughly
the first prince of the blood royal while he was still only a serene
highness but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king diffuse in
public concise in private reputed but not proved to be a miser at
bottom one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own
fancy or duty lettered but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman
but not a chevalier simple calm and strong adored by his family and
his household a fascinating talker an undeceived statesman inwardly
cold dominated by immediate interest always governing at the shortest
range incapable of rancor and of gratitude making use without mercy of
superiority on mediocrity clever in getting parliamentary majorities to
put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under
thrones unreserved sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve but
with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in expedients in
countenances in masks making france fear europe and europe france
incontestably fond of his country but preferring his family assuming
more domination than authority and more authority than dignity a
disposition which has this unfortunate property that as it turns
everything to success it admits of ruse and does not absolutely
repudiate baseness but which has this valuable side that it preserves
politics from violent shocks the state from fractures and society
indefatigable contradicting himself at times and giving himself the
lie bold against austria at ancona obstinate against england in spain
bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard singing the marseillaise
with conviction inaccessible to despondency to lassitude to the taste
for the beautiful and the ideal to daring generosity to utopia to
chimeras to wrath to vanity to fear possessing all the forms
of personal intrepidity a general at valmy a soldier at jemappes
attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling brave as a
grenadier courageous as a thinker uneasy only in the face of the
chances of a european shaking up and unfitted for great political
adventures always ready to risk his life never his work disguising
his will in influence in order that he might be obeyed as an
intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not
with divination not very attentive to minds but knowing men that is
to say requiring to see in order to judge prompt and penetrating
good sense practical wisdom easy speech prodigious memory drawing
incessantly on this memory his only point of resemblance with caesar
alexander and napoleon knowing deeds facts details dates proper
names ignorant of tendencies passions the diverse geniuses of the
crowd the interior aspirations the hidden and obscure uprisings of
souls in a word all that can be designated as the invisible currents
of consciences accepted by the surface but little in accord with
france lower down extricating himself by dint of tact governing too
much and not enough his own first minister excellent at creating out
of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas
mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and
organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the
founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and
something of an attorney in short a lofty and original figure a
prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness
of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe louis philippe
will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be
ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved
glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to
the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained
graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the
masses he pleased he had that gift of charming he lacked majesty he
wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man
his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new a
mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830 louis philippe
was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation
and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions
modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polonois and he
pronounced les hongrais he wore the uniform of the national guard like
charles x and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon
he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera
incorruptible by sacristans by whippers in by ballet dancers this
made a part of his bourgeois popularity he had no heart he went out
with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of
his aureole he was a bit of a mason a bit of a gardener something
of a doctor he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis
philippe no more went about without his lancet than did henri iv
without his poniard the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the
first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing
for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be
made there is that which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign
that which accuses the king three columns which all give different
totals democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of
secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed
military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arms the
rue transnonain the counsels of war the absorption of the real
country by the legal country on half shares with three hundred thousand
privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused
algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the
english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to
abd el kader blaye deutz bought pritchard paid these are the doings
of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the
as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the kings
this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france
louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation
of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of
everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity
which is displeasing to the people who have the 14th of july in their
moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled
first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his
family was deserved by the family that domestic group was worthy of
admiration virtues there dwelt side by side with talents one of louis
philippes daughters marie dorleans placed the name of her race among
artists as charles dorleans had placed it among poets she made of
her soul a marble which she named jeanne darc two of louis philippes
daughters elicited from metternich this eulogium they are young people
such as are rarely seen and princes such as are never seen
this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is
to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of
the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the
revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay
the fortune of louis philippe in 1830 never was there a more complete
adaptation of a man to an event the one entered into the other and the
incarnation took place louis philippe is 1830 made man moreover he
had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile he had
been proscribed a wanderer poor he had lived by his own labor in
switzerland this heir to the richest princely domains in france had
sold an old horse in order to obtain bread at reichenau he gave
lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did wool work and
sewed these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie
enthusiastic he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of
mont saint michel built by louis xi and used by louis xv he was the
companion of dumouriez he was the friend of lafayette he had belonged
to the jacobins club mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder danton
had said to him young man at the age of four and twenty in 93
being then m de chartres he had witnessed from the depth of a box
the trial of louis xvi so well named that poor tyrant the blind
clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the
king with royalty did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce
crushing of the idea the vast storm of the assembly tribunal the
public wrath interrogating capet not knowing what to reply the
alarming stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre
breath the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those
who condemned as well as of the man condemned he had looked on those
things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries
appear before the bar of the assembly convention he had beheld behind
louis xvi that unfortunate passer by who was made responsible the
terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and there had
lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of
the populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god
the trace left in him by the revolution was prodigious its memory was
like a living imprint of those great years minute by minute one day
in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt he
rectified from memory the whole of the letter a in the alphabetical list
louis philippe was a king of the broad daylight while he reigned the
press was free the tribune was free conscience and speech were free
the laws of september are open to sight although fully aware of the
gnawing power of light on privileges he left his throne exposed to the
light history will do justice to him for this loyalty
louis philippe like all historical men who have passed from the scene
is to day put on his trial by the human conscience his case is as yet
the hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent has
not yet sounded for him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite
judgment on this king the austere and illustrious historian louis blanc
has himself recently softened his first verdict louis philippe was
elected by those two almosts which are called the 221 and 1830 that is
to say by a half parliament and a half revolution and in any case
from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself we
cannot judge him here as the reader has seen above except with certain
reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle in the
eyes of the absolute outside these two rights the right of man in the
first place the right of the people in the second all is usurpation
but what we can say even at the present day that after making these
reserves is that to sum up the whole and in whatever manner he is
considered louis philippe taken in himself and from the point of view
of human goodness will remain to use the antique language of ancient
history one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne
what is there against him that throne take away louis philippe the
king there remains the man and the man is good he is good at times
even to the point of being admirable often in the midst of his gravest
souvenirs after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the
continent he returned at night to his apartments and there exhausted
with fatigue overwhelmed with sleep what did he do he took a death
sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit considering
it something to hold his own against europe but that it was a still
greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner he obstinately
maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals he disputed the
ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys
those chatterers of the law as he called them sometimes the pile of
sentences covered his table he examined them all it was anguish to
him to abandon these miserable condemned heads one day he said to
the same witness to whom we have recently referred i won seven last
night during the early years of his reign the death penalty was
as good as abolished and the erection of a scaffold was a violence
committed against the king the greve having disappeared with the elder
branch a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name
of the barriere saint jacques practical men felt the necessity of
a quasi legitimate guillotine and this was one of the victories of
casimir perier who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie
over louis philippe who represented its liberal sides louis philippe
annotated beccaria with his own hand after the fieschi machine he
exclaimed what a pity that i was not wounded then i might have
pardoned on another occasion alluding to the resistance offered by
his ministry he wrote in connection with a political criminal who is
one of the most generous figures of our day his pardon is granted it
only remains for me to obtain it louis philippe was as gentle as louis
now to our mind in history where kindness is the rarest of pearls
the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
louis philippe having been severely judged by some harshly perhaps by
others it is quite natural that a man himself a phantom at the present
day who knew that king should come and testify in his favor before
history this deposition whatever else it may be is evidently and
above all things entirely disinterested an epitaph penned by a dead
man is sincere one shade may console another shade the sharing of the
same shadows confers the right to praise it it is not greatly to
be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile this one
at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of
penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop
the beginning of louis philippes reign it was necessary that there
should be no equivoque and it became requisite that this book should
offer some explanation with regard to this king
louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority
without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a
revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the
revolution but in which he the duc dorleans exercised no personal
initiative he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have
been elected king he had not served this mandate on himself he had not
taken it it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced
wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in
accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance
with duty hence his possession was in good faith now we say it in
good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good
faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount
of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the
king nor on the democracy a clash of principles resembles a clash of
elements the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the
air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the
relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the
republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes
its suffering to day will constitute its safety later on and in any
case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is
evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on
two shores at once with one foot on the republic and one in royalty
it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are
so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a vendean is a
ruffian let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these
formidable collisions whatever the nature of these tempests may be
the government of 1830 led a hard life immediately born yesterday it
hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements
of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in
resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born on the
preceding evening from month to month the hostility increased and from
the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of
france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have
god delivers over to men his visible will in events an obscure text
written in a mysterious tongue men immediately make translations of it
translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense
very few minds comprehend the divine language the most sagacious the
calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with
their text the task has long been completed there are already twenty
translations on the public place from each remaining springs a party
and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it
alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the
there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are
for the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of god think
that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the
right to revolt against them error for in these revolutions the one
who revolts is not the people it is the king revolution is precisely
the contrary of revolt every revolution being a normal outcome
contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists
sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives
revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity a
revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real it is because it
none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of
1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning errors
make excellent projectiles they strike it cleverly in its vulnerable
spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this
revolution in its royalty they shouted to it revolution why this
king factions are blind men who aim correctly
this cry was uttered equally by the republicans but coming from
them this cry was logical what was blindness in the legitimists was
clearness of vision in the democrats 1830 had bankrupted the people
between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the
establishment of july struggled it represented the minute at
loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other
in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had
become a monarchy 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all europe to
keep the peace was an increase of complication a harmony established
contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war from this secret
conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace
that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the
european cabinets is suspicious in itself the royalty of july reared
up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european
cabinets metternich would gladly have put it in kicking straps pushed
on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loiterers
in europe after having been towed it undertook to tow
meanwhile within her pauperism the proletariat salary education
penal servitude prostitution the fate of the woman wealth misery
production consumption division exchange coin credit the rights of
capital the rights of labor all these questions were multiplied above
outside of political parties properly so called another movement became
the elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner but
thinkers meditated while the soil that is to say the people
traversed by revolutionary currents trembled under them with
indescribably vague epileptic shocks these dreamers some isolated
others united in families and almost in communion turned over social
questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive miners who
tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano hardly
disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught
this tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated
these men left to political parties the question of rights they
the well being of man that was what they wanted to extract from
they raised material questions questions of agriculture of industry
of commerce almost to the dignity of a religion in civilization such
as it has formed itself a little by the command of god a great deal by
the agency of man interests combine unite and amalgamate in a
manner to form a veritable hard rock in accordance with a dynamic law
patiently studied by economists those geologists of politics these men
who grouped themselves under different appellations but who may all be
designated by the generic title of socialists endeavored to pierce that
rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity
from the question of the scaffold to the question of war their works
embraced everything to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french
revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child
the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not
here treat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the
questions raised by socialism we confine ourselves to indicating them
all the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves cosmogonic
visions revery and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two
the first problem contains the question of work
in the first problem the employment of forces is in question
from the proper employment of forces results public power
from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness
by a good distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must
from these two things combined the public power without individual
social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation
england solves the first of these two problems she creates wealth
admirably she divides it badly this solution which is complete on
one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence
monstrous wretchedness all enjoyments for some all privations for the
rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly
