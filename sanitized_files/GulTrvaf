miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of
one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet
it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the
sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will
at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with
the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their
they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the
like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their
beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of
life when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question
is about the suns health how he looked at his setting and rising and
what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet this
conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys
discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and
hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for
the women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn their
husbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is always
a considerable number from the continent below attending at court
either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their own
particular occasions but are much despised because they want the same
endowments among these the ladies choose their gallants but the
vexation is that they act with too much ease and security for the
husband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover may
proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be but
provided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his side
the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island although
i think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and although
they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowed
to do whatever they please they long to see the world and take the
diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without a
particular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtained
because the people of quality have found by frequent experience how
hard it is to persuade their women to return from below i was told that
a great court lady who had several children is married to the prime
minister the richest subject in the kingdom a very graceful person
extremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the island went
down to lagado on the pretence of health there hid herself for several
months till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she was found
in an obscure eating house all in rags having pawned her clothes to
maintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whose
company she was taken much against her will and although her husband
received her with all possible kindness and without the least reproach
she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to the
same gallant and has not been heard of since
this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english
story than for one of a country so remote but he may please to
consider that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate
or nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easily
in about a months time i had made a tolerable proficiency in their
language and was able to answer most of the kings questions when i had
the honour to attend him his majesty discovered not the least curiosity
to inquire into the laws government history religion or manners of
the countries where i had been but confined his questions to the state
of mathematics and received the account i gave him with great contempt
and indifference though often roused by his flapper on each side
a phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy the laputians
great improvements in the latter the kings method of suppressing
i desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island
which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attend
me i chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it
owed its several motions whereof i will now give a philosophical account
the flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter 7837
yards or about four miles and a half and consequently contains ten
thousand acres it is three hundred yards thick the bottom or under
surface which appears to those who view it below is one even regular
plate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards
above it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is a
coat of rich mould ten or twelve feet deep the declivity of the upper
surface from the circumference to the centre is the natural cause why
all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in small
rivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four large
basins each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundred yards
distant from the centre from these basins the water is continually
exhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents their
overflowing besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the
island above the region of clouds and vapours he can prevent the falling
of dews and rain whenever he pleases for the highest clouds cannot rise
above two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known to
at the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in
diameter whence the astronomers descend into a large dome which is
therefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomers cave situated
at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant
in this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from the
reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part the
place is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopes
astrolabes and other astronomical instruments but the greatest
curiosity upon which the fate of the island depends is a loadstone of a
prodigious size in shape resembling a weavers shuttle it is in length
six yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over this
magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its
middle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakest
hand can turn it it is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant
four feet yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eight
adamantine feet each six yards high in the middle of the concave side
there is a groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of the
axle are lodged and turned round as there is occasion
the stone cannot be removed from its place by any force because the hoop
and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which
by means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and move
from one place to another for with respect to that part of the earth
over which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sides
with an attractive power and at the other with a repulsive upon
placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth the
island descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards the
island mounts directly upwards when the position of the stone is
oblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet the
forces always act in lines parallel to its direction
by this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the
monarchs dominions to explain the manner of its progress let a b
represent a line drawn across the dominions of balnibarbi let the line
c d represent the loadstone of which let d be the repelling end
and c the attracting end the island being over c let the stone be
placed in position c d with its repelling end downwards then the
island will be driven upwards obliquely towards d when it is arrived
at d let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end
points towards e and then the island will be carried obliquely towards
e where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in
the position e f with its repelling point downwards the island will
rise obliquely towards f where by directing the attracting end
towards g the island may be carried to g and from g to h by
turning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity to point
directly downward and thus by changing the situation of the stone as
often as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turns
in an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings the
obliquity being not considerable is conveyed from one part of the
but it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the extent
of the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four miles
for which the astronomers who have written large systems concerning the
stone assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does not
extend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral which
acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about six
leagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globe
but terminated with the limits of the kings dominions and it was easy
from the great advantage of such a superior situation for a prince to
bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of
when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island
stands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equal
distance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawing
downwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion can
this loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from time
to time give it such positions as the monarch directs they spend the
greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies which
they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness
for although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet they
magnify much more than those of a hundred with us and show the stars
with greater clearness this advantage has enabled them to extend their
discoveries much further than our astronomers in europe for they have
made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours
do not contain above one third part of that number they have likewise
discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about mars
whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet
exactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the former
revolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twenty one and a
half so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the
same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of mars
which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation
they have observed ninety three different comets and settled their
periods with great exactness if this be true and they affirm it with
great confidence it is much to be wished that their observations were
made public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lame
and defective might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of
the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he could
but prevail on a ministry to join with him but these having their
estates below on the continent and considering that the office of a
favourite has a very uncertain tenure would never consent to the
if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violent
factions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods of
reducing them to obedience the first and the mildest course is by
keeping the island hovering over such a town and the lands about it
whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and
consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if the
crime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with great
stones against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars
or caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces but if
they still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections he
proceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upon
their heads which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men
however this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven
neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare his
ministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odious
to the people so it would be a great damage to their own estates which
all lie below for the island is the kings demesne
but there is still indeed a more weighty reason why the kings of this
country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action
unless upon the utmost necessity for if the town intended to be
destroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out in
the larger cities a situation probably chosen at first with a view to
prevent such a catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars of
stone a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the
island which although it consist as i have said of one entire
adamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great a
shock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below
as the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys of
all this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carry
their obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned and the
king when he is highest provoked and most determined to press a city to
rubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of a
pretence of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breaking
the adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their
philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and the
by a fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of his
two eldest sons are permitted to leave the island nor the queen till
the author leaves laputa is conveyed to balnibarbi arrives at the
metropolis a description of the metropolis and the country adjoining
the author hospitably received by a great lord his conversation with
although i cannot say that i was ill treated in this island yet i must
confess i thought myself too much neglected not without some degree of
contempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any
part of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein i was far their
inferior and upon that account very little regarded
on the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island i
was very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those people
they were indeed excellent in two sciences for which i have great esteem
and wherein i am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted and
involved in speculation that i never met with such disagreeable
companions i conversed only with women tradesmen flappers and
court pages during two months of my abode there by which at last i
rendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only people
from whom i could ever receive a reasonable answer
i had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in their
language i was weary of being confined to an island where i received so
little countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity
there was a great lord at court nearly related to the king and for that
reason alone used with respect he was universally reckoned the most
ignorant and stupid person among them he had performed many eminent
services for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adorned
with integrity and honour but so ill an ear for music that his
detractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrong
place neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him
to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics he was
pleased to show me many marks of favour often did me the honour of a
visit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws and
customs the manners and learning of the several countries where i had
travelled he listened to me with great attention and made very wise
observations on all i spoke he had two flappers attending him for
state but never made use of them except at court and in visits of
ceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alone
i entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his
majesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleased
to tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers very
advantageous which however i refused with expressions of the highest
on the 16th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court the
king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds english
and my protector his kinsman as much more together with a letter of
recommendation to a friend of his in lagado the metropolis the island
being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it i was let
down from the lowest gallery in the same manner as i had been taken up
the continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying
island passes under the general name of balnibarbi and the
metropolis as i said before is called lagado i felt some little
satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground i walked to the city
without any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficiently
instructed to converse with them i soon found out the persons house to
whom i was recommended presented my letter from his friend the grandee
in the island and was received with much kindness this great lord
whose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where i
continued during my stay and was entertained in a most hospitable
the next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the
town which is about half the bigness of london but the houses very
strangely built and most of them out of repair the people in the
streets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally in
rags we passed through one of the town gates and went about three
miles into the country where i saw many labourers working with several
sorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what they
were about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass
although the soil appeared to be excellent i could not forbear admiring
at these odd appearances both in town and country and i made bold to
desire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what
could be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in the
streets and the fields because i did not discover any good effects they
produced but on the contrary i never knew a soil so unhappily
cultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or a people whose
countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want
this lord munodi was a person of the first rank and had been some years
governor of lagado but by a cabal of ministers was discharged for
insufficiency however the king treated him with tenderness as a
well meaning man but of a low contemptible understanding
when i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made
no further answer than by telling me that i had not been long enough
among them to form a judgment and that the different nations of the
world had different customs with other common topics to the same
purpose but when we returned to his palace he asked me how i liked
the building what absurdities i observed and what quarrel i had with
the dress or looks of his domestics this he might safely do because
every thing about him was magnificent regular and polite i answered
that his excellencys prudence quality and fortune had exempted him
from those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others he
said if i would go with him to his country house about twenty miles
distant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kind
of conversation i told his excellency that i was entirely at his
disposal and accordingly we set out next morning
during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers
in managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable for
except in some very few places i could not discover one ear of corn or
blade of grass but in three hours travelling the scene was wholly
altered we came into a most beautiful country farmers houses at small
distances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyards
corn grounds and meadows neither do i remember to have seen a more
delightful prospect his excellency observed my countenance to clear up
he told me with a sigh that there his estate began and would continue
the same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculed
and despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting so
ill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very few
such as were old and wilful and weak like himself
we came at length to the house which was indeed a noble structure built
according to the best rules of ancient architecture the fountains
gardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exact
judgment and taste i gave due praises to every thing i saw whereof his
excellency took not the least notice till after supper when there being
no third companion he told me with a very melancholy air that he
doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country to rebuild
them after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast others
into such a form as modern usage required and give the same directions
to all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride
singularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase his
majestys displeasure that the admiration i appeared to be under would
cease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars which
probably i never heard of at court the people there being too much
taken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed here
the sum of his discourse was to this effect that about forty years ago
certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion
and after five months continuance came back with a very little
smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that
airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the
management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all
arts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot to this end
they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in
lagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that there
is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy
in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of
agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades
and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work
of ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as to
last for ever without repairing all the fruits of the earth shall come
to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase a
hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy
proposals the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are
yet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country lies
miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or
clothes by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty
times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally
on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising
spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses
his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life
without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had
done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill will
as enemies to art ignorant and ill common wealths men preferring
their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their
his lordship added that he would not by any further particulars
prevent the pleasure i should certainly take in viewing the grand
academy whither he was resolved i should go he only desired me to
observe a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three miles
distant of which he gave me this account that he had a very convenient
mill within half a mile of his house turned by a current from a large
river and sufficient for his own family as well as a great number of
his tenants that about seven years ago a club of those projectors came
to him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the side
of that mountain on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut for
a repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply
the mill because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water and
thereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending down
a declivity would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose
course is more upon a level he said that being then not very well
with the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with the
proposal and after employing a hundred men for two years the work
miscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon him
railing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experiment
with equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointment
in a few days we came back to town and his excellency considering the
bad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself but
recommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither my lord
was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects and a person
of much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truth
for i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days
the author permitted to see the grand academy of lagado the academy
largely described the arts wherein the professors employ themselves
this academy is not an entire single building but a continuation of
several houses on both sides of a street which growing waste was
i was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to the
academy every room has in it one or more projectors and i believe i
could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms
the first man i saw was of a meagre aspect with sooty hands and face
his hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places his
clothes shirt and skin were all of the same colour he has been eight
years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which were
to be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in
raw inclement summers he told me he did not doubt that in eight
years more he should be able to supply the governors gardens with
sunshine at a reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low
and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity
especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers i made
him a small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose
because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them
i went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almost
overcome with a horrible stink my conductor pressed me forward
conjuring me in a whisper to give no offence which would be highly
resented and therefore i durst not so much as stop my nose the
projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy his
face and beard were of a pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed over
with filth when i was presented to him he gave me a close embrace a
compliment i could well have excused his employment from his first
coming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement to
its original food by separating the several parts removing the tincture
which it receives from the gall making the odour exhale and scumming
off the saliva he had a weekly allowance from the society of a vessel
filled with human ordure about the bigness of a bristol barrel
i saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showed
me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire which
there was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method for
building houses by beginning at the roof and working downward to the
foundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those two
there was a man born blind who had several apprentices in his own
condition their employment was to mix colours for painters which their
master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling it was indeed
my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their
lessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken
this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity
in another apartment i was highly pleased with a projector who had found
a device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges of
ploughs cattle and labour the method is this in an acre of ground
you bury at six inches distance and eight deep a quantity of acorns
dates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are
fondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field
where in a few days they will root up the whole ground in search of
their food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it with
their dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge and
trouble very great and they had little or no crop however it is not
doubted that this invention may be capable of great improvement
i went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round
with cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out
at my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs he
lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using
silkworms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely
excelled the former because they understood how to weave as well as
spin and he proposed further that by employing spiders the charge
of dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof i was fully convinced
when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured
wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take a
tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit
everybodys fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of
certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength and
there was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sun dial upon the
great weathercock on the town house by adjusting the annual and diurnal
motions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with all
i was complaining of a small fit of the colic upon which my conductor
led me into a room where a great physician resided who was famous for
curing that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument he
had a large pair of bellows with a long slender muzzle of ivory this he
conveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmed
he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder but when the disease
was more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellows
were full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient then
withdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb strongly
against the orifice of then fundament and this being repeated three or
four times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxious
along with it like water put into a pump and the patient recovered
i saw him try both experiments upon a dog but could not discern any
effect from the former after the latter the animal was ready to burst
and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my
companion the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavouring
i visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with all
the curiosities i observed being studious of brevity
i had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other being
appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of whom i shall
say something when i have mentioned one illustrious person more who is
called among them the universal artist he told us he had been thirty
years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life he had
two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at work
some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance by extracting the
nitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate others
softening marble for pillows and pin cushions others petrifying the
hoofs of a living horse to preserve them from foundering the artist
himself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sow
land with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be
contained as he demonstrated by several experiments which i was not
skilful enough to comprehend the other was by a certain composition of
gums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth
of wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in a reasonable time to
propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom
we crossed a walk to the other part of the academy where as i have
already said the projectors in speculative learning resided
the first professor i saw was in a very large room with forty pupils
about him after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon a
frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of
the room he said perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a
project for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical
operations but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and
he flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang in
any other mans head every one knew how laborious the usual method is
of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most
ignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labour
might write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics and
theology without the least assistance from genius or study he then
led me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in
ranks it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room the
superfices was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of a
die but some larger than others they were all linked together by
slender wires these bits of wood were covered on every square with
paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of
their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but
without any order the professor then desired me to observe for he was
going to set his engine at work the pupils at his command took each
of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round the
edges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn the whole disposition
of the words was entirely changed he then commanded six and thirty of
the lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the
frame and where they found three or four words together that might make
part of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were
scribes this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn
the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places as
the square bits of wood moved upside down
six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour and the
professor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected of
broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those
rich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts and
sciences which however might be still improved and much expedited if
the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such
frames in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common their
he assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his
youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and made
the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books
between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts of
i made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for his
great communicativeness and promised if ever i had the good fortune to
return to my native country that i would do him justice as the sole
inventor of this wonderful machine the form and contrivance of which i
desired leave to delineate on paper as in the figure here annexed i
told him although it were the custom of our learned in europe to steal
inventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage that
it became a controversy which was the right owner yet i would take such
caution that he should have the honour entire without a rival
we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in
consultation upon improving that of their own country
the first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables
into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all
the other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words
whatsoever and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health
as well as brevity for it is plain that every word we speak is in
some degree a diminution of our lunge by corrosion and consequently
contributes to the shortening of our lives an expedient was therefore
offered that since words are only names for things it would be more
convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary
to express a particular business they are to discourse on and this
invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well as
health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and
illiterate had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be
allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of
their forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are
the common people however many of the most learned and wise adhere to
the new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only this
inconvenience attending it that if a mans business be very great and
of various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater
bundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strong
servants to attend him i have often beheld two of those sages almost
sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when
they met in the street would lay down their loads open their sacks and
hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements
help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave
but for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pockets
and under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he cannot be
at a loss therefore the room where company meet who practise this art
is full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter for
another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would
serve as a universal language to be understood in all civilised nations
whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly
resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended and thus
ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes or
ministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangers
i was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupils
after a method scarce imaginable to us in europe the proposition and
demonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer with ink composed of
a cephalic tincture this the student was to swallow upon a fasting
stomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water
as the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing the
proposition along with it but the success has not hitherto been
answerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition and
partly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus is so nauseous
that they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it can
operate neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an
a further account of the academy the author proposes some improvements
in the school of political projectors i was but ill entertained the
professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses which
is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy these unhappy people
were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon
the score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers to
consult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminent
services of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing
it on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing for
employments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wild
impossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man to
conceive and confirmed in me the old observation that there is nothing
so extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have not
but however i shall so far do justice to this part of the academy as
to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary there was a most
ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature
and system of government this illustrious person had very usefully
employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases
and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are
subject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as by
the licentiousness of those who are to obey for instance whereas all
writers and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universal
resemblance between the natural and the political body can there be any
thing more evident than that the health of both must be preserved and
the diseases cured by the same prescriptions it is allowed that
senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullient
and other peccant humours with many diseases of the head and more of
the heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of the
nerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleen
flatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumours full of fetid
purulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites and
crudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention this
doctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of the senate certain
physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting and at
the close of each days debate feel the pulses of every senator after
which having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the
several maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth day
return to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored with
proper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of them
acoustics as their several cases required and according as these
medicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the next
this project could not be of any great expense to the public and might
in my poor opinion be of much use for the despatch of business in those
countries where senates have any share in the legislative power beget
unanimity shorten debates open a few mouths which are now closed and
close many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young and
correct the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pert
again because it is a general complaint that the favourites of princes
are troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposed
that whoever attended a first minister after having told his business
with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at his
departure give the said minister a tweak by the nose or a kick in the
belly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or run a
pin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to prevent
forgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation till
he likewise directed that every senator in the great council of a
nation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defence of
it should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if that
were done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the
when parties in a state are violent he offered a wonderful contrivance
to reconcile them the method is this you take a hundred leaders of
each party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest
of a size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple
at the same time in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided
let the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to the
head of his opposite party man it seems indeed to be a work that
requires some exactness but the professor assured us that if it were
dexterously performed the cure would be infallible for he argued
thus that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between
themselves within the space of one skull would soon come to a good
understanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity of
thinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imagine
they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as to
the difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who are
directors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge that
i heard a very warm debate between two professors about the most
commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without
grieving the subject the first affirmed the justest method would be
to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon every
man to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighbours
the second was of an opinion directly contrary to tax those qualities
of body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to be
more or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereof
should be left entirely to their own breast the highest tax was upon
men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex and the
assessments according to the number and nature of the favours they have
received for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers wit
valour and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed and
collected in the same manner by every persons giving his own word for
the quantum of what he possessed but as to honour justice wisdom and
learning they should not be taxed at all because they are
qualifications of so singular a kind that no man will either allow them
in his neighbour or value them in himself
the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill
in dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to be
determined by their own judgment but constancy chastity good sense
and good nature were not rated because they would not bear the charge
to keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that the
members should raffle for employment every man first taking an oath and
giving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or not
after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling upon
the next vacancy thus hope and expectation would be kept alive none
would complain of broken promises but impute their disappointments
wholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of
another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering
plots and conspiracies against the government he advised great
statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times
of eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wipe
their posteriors take a strict view of their excrements and from the
colour the odour the taste the consistence the crudeness or maturity
of digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and designs because men
are never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stool
which he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when he
used merely as a trial to consider which was the best way of murdering
the king his ordure would have a tincture of green but quite different
when he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the
the whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing many
observations both curious and useful for politicians but as i
conceived not altogether complete this i ventured to tell the author
and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions he
received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers
especially those of the projecting species professing he would be glad
i told him that in the kingdom of tribnia 454a by the natives called
langdon 454b where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk
of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses
their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the
colours the conduct and the pay of ministers of state and their
deputies the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of
those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound
politicians to restore new vigour to a crazy administration to stifle
or divert general discontents to fill their coffers with forfeitures
and raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall best
answer their private advantage it is first agreed and settled among
them what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot then effectual
care is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the owners
in chains these papers are delivered to a set of artists very
dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables and
letters for instance they can discover a close stool to signify a
privy council a flock of geese a senate a lame dog an invader the
plague a standing army a buzzard a prime minister the gout a high
priest a gibbet a secretary of state a chamber pot a committee of
grandees a sieve a court lady a broom a revolution a mouse trap an
employment a bottomless pit a treasury a sink a court a cap and
bells a favourite a broken reed a court of justice an empty tun a
when this method fails they have two others more effectual which the
learned among them call acrostics and anagrams first they can decipher
all initial letters into political meanings thus n shall signify a
plot b a regiment of horse l a fleet at sea or secondly by
transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they can
lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party so for example
if i should say in a letter to a friend our brother tom has just got
the piles a skilful decipherer would discover that the same letters
which compose that sentence may be analysed into the following words
resist  a plot is brought home the tour and this is the
the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these
observations and promised to make honourable mention of me in his
i saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer
continuance and began to think of returning home to england
the author leaves lagado arrives at maldonada no ship ready he takes
a short voyage to glubbdubdrib his reception by the governor
the continent of which this kingdom is apart extends itself as i have
reason to believe eastward to that unknown tract of america westward of
california and north to the pacific ocean which is not above a hundred
and fifty miles from lagado where there is a good port and much
commerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the north west
about 29 degrees north latitude and 140 longitude this island of
luggnagg stands south eastward of japan about a hundred leagues distant
there is a strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king of
luggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island
to the other i determined therefore to direct my course this way in
order to my return to europe i hired two mules with a guide to show
me the way and carry my small baggage i took leave of my noble
protector who had shown me so much favour and made me a generous
my journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating when i
arrived at the port of maldonada for so it is called there was no ship
in the harbour bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time the
town is about as large as portsmouth i soon fell into some
acquaintance and was very hospitably received a gentleman of
distinction said to me that since the ships bound for luggnagg could
not be ready in less than a month it might be no disagreeable amusement
for me to take a trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about five
leagues off to the south west he offered himself and a friend to
accompany me and that i should be provided with a small convenient bark
glubbdubdrib as nearly as i can interpret the word signifies the island
of sorcerers or magicians it is about one third as large as the isle of
wight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of a certain
tribe who are all magicians this tribe marries only among each other
and the eldest in succession is prince or governor he has a noble
palace and a park of about three thousand acres surrounded by a wall of
hewn stone twenty feet high in this park are several small enclosures
the governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a
kind somewhat unusual by his skill in necromancy he has a power of
calling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service for
twenty four hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons up
again in less than three months except upon very extraordinary
when we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning one
of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired
admittance for a stranger who came on purpose to have the honour of
attending on his highness this was immediately granted and we all
three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armed
and dressed after a very antic manner and with something in their
countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express we
passed through several apartments between servants of the same sort
ranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presence
where after three profound obeisances and a few general questions we
were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his
highnesss throne he understood the language of balnibarbi although it
was different from that of this island he desired me to give him some
account of my travels and to let me see that i should be treated
without ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his
finger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instant
like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden i could not recover
myself in some time till the governor assured me that i should receive
no hurt and observing my two companions to be under no concern who had
been often entertained in the same manner i began to take courage and
related to his highness a short history of my several adventures yet not
without some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the place
where i had seen those domestic spectres i had the honour to dine with
the governor where a new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited at
table i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in the
morning i stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuse
me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace my two
friends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining which is the
capital of this little island and the next morning we returned to pay
our duty to the governor as he was pleased to command us
after this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part of
every day with the governor and at night in our lodging i soon grew so
familiarized to the sight of spirits that after the third or fourth time
they gave me no emotion at all or if i had any apprehensions left my
curiosity prevailed over them for his highness the governor ordered me
to call up whatever persons i would choose to name and in whatever
numbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the
present time and command them to answer any questions i should think fit
to ask with this condition that my questions must be confined within
the compass of the times they lived in and one thing i might depend
upon that they would certainly tell me the truth for lying was a talent
i made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour
we were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into the
park and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes
of pomp and magnificence i desired to see alexander the great at the
head of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon a motion
of the governors finger immediately appeared in a large field under
the window where we stood alexander was called up into the room it was
with great difficulty that i understood his greek and had but little of
my own he assured me upon his honour that he was not poisoned but
died of a bad fever by excessive drinking
next i saw hannibal passing the alps who told me he had not a drop of
i saw csar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engage
i saw the former in his last great triumph i desired that the senate
of rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly of
somewhat a later age in counterview in another the first seemed to be
an assembly of heroes and demigods the other a knot of pedlars
