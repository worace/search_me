then i think i wouldnt if i was you
why said stryver now ill put you in a corner forensically
shaking a forefinger at him you are a man of business and bound to
have a reason state your reason why wouldnt you go
because said mr lorry i wouldnt go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that i should succeed
d n me cried stryver but this beats everything
mr lorry glanced at the distant house and glanced at the angry
heres a man of business a man of years a man of experience in
a bank said stryver and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success he says theres no reason at all says it with his
head on mr stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off
when i speak of success i speak of success with the young lady and
when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable i speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady the young
lady my good sir said mr lorry mildly tapping the stryver arm the
young lady the young lady goes before all
then you mean to tell me mr lorry said stryver squaring his
elbows that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
not exactly so i mean to tell you mr stryver said mr lorry
reddening that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips and that if i knew any man which i hope i do not whose
taste was so coarse and whose temper was so overbearing that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk not even tellsons should prevent my giving him a piece of my
the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr stryvers
blood vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry
mr lorrys veins methodical as their courses could usually be were in
no better state now it was his turn
that is what i mean to tell you sir said mr lorry pray let there
mr stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it which probably gave him the
toothache he broke the awkward silence by saying
this is something new to me mr lorry you deliberately advise me not
to go up to soho and offer myself myself stryver of the kings bench
do you ask me for my advice mr stryver
very good then i give it and you have repeated it correctly
and all i can say of it is laughed stryver with a vexed laugh that
this ha ha beats everything past present and to come
now understand me pursued mr lorry as a man of business i am
not justified in saying anything about this matter for as a man of
business i know nothing of it but as an old fellow who has carried
miss manette in his arms who is the trusted friend of miss manette and
of her father too and who has a great affection for them both i have
spoken the confidence is not of my seeking recollect now you think i
not i said stryver whistling i cant undertake to find third
parties in common sense i can only find it for myself i suppose sense
in certain quarters you suppose mincing bread and butter nonsense its
new to me but you are right i dare say
what i suppose mr stryver i claim to characterise for myself and
understand me sir said mr lorry quickly flushing again i
will not not even at tellsons have it characterised for me by any
granted thank you well mr stryver i was about to say it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken it might be painful to doctor
manette to have the task of being explicit with you it might be very
painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you you
know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family if you please committing you in no way representing you
in no way i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it if you should then be dissatisfied with it you can but test its
soundness for yourself if on the other hand you should be satisfied
with it and it should be what it now is it may spare all sides what is
how long would you keep me in town
oh it is only a question of a few hours i could go to soho in the
then i say yes said stryver i wont go up there now i am not so
hot upon it as that comes to i say yes and i shall expect you to look
then mr stryver turned and burst out of the bank causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing and were popularly
believed when they had bowed a customer out still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in
the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow he got it down and now said mr stryver shaking his
forensic forefinger at the temple in general when it was down my way
out of this is to put you all in the wrong
it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician in which he found
great relief you shall not put me in the wrong young lady said mr
accordingly when mr lorry called that night as late as ten oclock
mr stryver among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning he even showed surprise when he saw mr lorry and was
well said that good natured emissary after a full half hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question i have been to
to soho repeated mr stryver coldly oh to be sure what am i
and i have no doubt said mr lorry that i was right in the
conversation we had my opinion is confirmed and i reiterate my
i assure you returned mr stryver in the friendliest way that i
am sorry for it on your account and sorry for it on the poor fathers
account i know this must always be a sore subject with the family let
i dare say not rejoined stryver nodding his head in a smoothing and
no it doesnt i assure you it doesnt having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition i am well out of my mistake and no harm is
done young women have committed similar follies often before and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before in an unselfish
aspect i am sorry that the thing is dropped because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view in a selfish aspect i am
glad that the thing has dropped because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view it is hardly necessary to say i could
have gained nothing by it there is no harm at all done i have not
proposed to the young lady and between ourselves i am by no means
certain on reflection that i ever should have committed myself to
that extent mr lorry you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty headed girls you must not expect to do it or you
will always be disappointed now pray say no more about it i tell you
i regret it on account of others but i am satisfied on my own account
and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you
and for giving me your advice you know the young lady better than i do
you were right it never would have done
mr lorry was so taken aback that he looked quite stupidly at mr
stryver shouldering him towards the door with an appearance of
showering generosity forbearance and goodwill on his erring head
make the best of it my dear sir said stryver say no more about it
thank you again for allowing me to sound you good night
mr lorry was out in the night before he knew where he was mr stryver
was lying back on his sofa winking at his ceiling
if sydney carton ever shone anywhere he certainly never shone in the
house of doctor manette he had been there often during a whole year
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there when he
cared to talk he talked well but the cloud of caring for nothing
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness was very rarely
and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things else forgotten and unattainable
into his mind of late the neglected bed in the temple court had known
him more scantily than ever and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes he had got up again and haunted that
on a day in august when mr stryver after notifying to his jackal
that he had thought better of that marrying matter had carried his
delicacy into devonshire and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst of health
for the sickliest and of youth for the oldest sydneys feet still trod
those stones from being irresolute and purposeless his feet became
animated by an intention and in the working out of that intention
he was shown up stairs and found lucie at her work alone she had
never been quite at her ease with him and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table but looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few common places she observed
i fear you are not well mr carton
no but the life i lead miss manette is not conducive to health what
is to be expected of or by such profligates
is it not forgive me i have begun the question on my lips a pity to
looking gently at him again she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes there were tears in his voice too as he
it is too late for that i shall never be better than i am i shall
he leaned an elbow on her table and covered his eyes with his hand the
she had never seen him softened and was much distressed he knew her to
be so without looking at her and said
pray forgive me miss manette i break down before the knowledge of
what i want to say to you will you hear me
if it will do you any good mr carton if it would make you happier
he unshaded his face after a little while and spoke steadily
dont be afraid to hear me dont shrink from anything i say i am like
one who died young all my life might have been
no mr carton i am sure that the best part of it might still be i am
sure that you might be much much worthier of yourself
say of you miss manette and although i know better although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart i know better i shall never forget
she was pale and trembling he came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
if it had been possible miss manette that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself flung away wasted drunken
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be he would have been
conscious this day and hour in spite of his happiness that he would
bring you to misery bring you to sorrow and repentance blight you
disgrace you pull you down with him i know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me i ask for none i am even thankful that it cannot
without it can i not save you mr carton can i not recall
you forgive me again to a better course can i in no way repay your
confidence i know this is a confidence she modestly said after a
little hesitation and in earnest tears i know you would say this to
no one else can i turn it to no good account for yourself mr carton
to none no miss manette to none if you will hear me through a very
little more all you can ever do for me is done i wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul in my degradation i have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father and of this
home made such a home by you has stirred old shadows that i thought had
died out of me since i knew you i have been troubled by a remorse that
i thought would never reproach me again and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward that i thought were silent for ever i
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh beginning anew shaking off
sloth and sensuality and fighting out the abandoned fight a dream all
a dream that ends in nothing and leaves the sleeper where he lay down
but i wish you to know that you inspired it
will nothing of it remain o mr carton think again try again
no miss manette all through it i have known myself to be quite
undeserving and yet i have had the weakness and have still the
weakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me
heap of ashes that i am into fire a fire however inseparable in
its nature from myself quickening nothing lighting nothing doing no
since it is my misfortune mr carton to have made you more unhappy
dont say that miss manette for you would have reclaimed me if
anything could you will not be the cause of my becoming worse
since the state of your mind that you describe is at all events
attributable to some influence of mine this is what i mean if i can
make it plain can i use no influence to serve you have i no power for
the utmost good that i am capable of now miss manette i have come
here to realise let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life
the remembrance that i opened my heart to you last of all the world
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
which i entreated you to believe again and again most fervently with
all my heart was capable of better things mr carton
entreat me to believe it no more miss manette i have proved myself
and i know better i distress you i draw fast to an end will you let
me believe when i recall this day that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast and that it lies there
alone and will be shared by no one
if that will be a consolation to you yes
not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you
mr carton she answered after an agitated pause the secret is
yours not mine and i promise to respect it
he put her hand to his lips and moved towards the door
be under no apprehension miss manette of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word i will never refer to it
again if i were dead that could not be surer than it is henceforth in
the hour of my death i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance and
shall thank and bless you for it that my last avowal of myself was made
to you and that my name and faults and miseries were gently carried
in your heart may it otherwise be light and happy
he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away and how much he every day kept
down and perverted that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he
be comforted he said i am not worth such feeling miss manette an
hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that i scorn
but yield to will render me less worth such tears as those than any
wretch who creeps along the streets be comforted but within myself i
shall always be towards you what i am now though outwardly i shall be
what you have heretofore seen me the last supplication but one i make
to you is that you will believe this of me
my last supplication of all is this and with it i will relieve
you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison and
between whom and you there is an impassable space it is useless to say
it i know but it rises out of my soul for you and for any dear to
you i would do anything if my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it i would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you try to hold
me in your mind at some quiet times as ardent and sincere in this one
thing the time will come the time will not be long in coming when new
ties will be formed about you ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you o miss manette when the little picture of a
happy fathers face looks up in yours when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life to keep a life you love beside you
he said farewell said a last god bless you and left her
to the eyes of mr jeremiah cruncher sitting on his stool in
fleet street with his grisly urchin beside him a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented who could sit
upon anything in fleet street during the busy hours of the day and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions one ever tending
westward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sun
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
with his straw in his mouth mr cruncher sat watching the two streams
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream saving that jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from
tellsons side of the tides to the opposite shore brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance mr cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health and it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose that he recruited his finances as just now observed
time was when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place and mused in
the sight of men mr cruncher sitting on a stool in a public place
but not being a poet mused as little as possible and looked about him
it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few and belated women few and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs
cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when an
unusual concourse pouring down fleet street westward attracted his
attention looking that way mr cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along and that there was popular objection to this
young jerry said mr cruncher turning to his offspring its a
the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance the elder gentleman took the cry so ill that he watched
his opportunity and smote the young gentleman on the ear
what dye mean what are you hooroaring at what do you want to conwey
to your own father you young rip this boy is a getting too many for
me said mr cruncher surveying him him and his hooroars dont
let me hear no more of you or you shall feel some more of me dye
i warnt doing no harm young jerry protested rubbing his cheek
drop it then said mr cruncher i wont have none of your no
harms get a top of that there seat and look at the crowd
his son obeyed and the crowd approached they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position the position
appeared by no means to please him however with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach deriding him making grimaces at him and
incessantly groaning and calling out yah spies tst yaha spies
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat
funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr cruncher he
always pricked up his senses and became excited when a funeral passed
tellsons naturally therefore a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly and he asked of the first man who ran against him
i dont know said the man spies yaha tst spies
i dont know returned the man clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour spies yaha tst tst spi ies
at length a person better informed on the merits of the case tumbled
against him and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
old bailey spy returned his informant yaha tst yah old bailey
why to be sure exclaimed jerry recalling the trial at which he had
dead as mutton returned the other and cant be too dead have em
out there spies pull em out there spies
the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have em out and to pull em out mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop on the crowds opening the coach
doors the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment but he was so alert and made such good use of his time
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye street after
shedding his cloak hat long hatband white pocket handkerchief and
these the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing practical suggestions being
much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tellsons in the further corner of the mourning
the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies but the river being alarmingly near and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief
the remodelled procession started with a chimney sweep driving the
hearse advised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under
close inspection for the purpose and with a pieman also attended
by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach a bear leader a
popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional
ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand and his
bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked
thus with beer drinking pipe smoking song roaring and infinite
caricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting
at every step and all the shops shutting up before it its destination
was the old church of saint pancras far off in the fields it got there
in course of time insisted on pouring into the burial ground finally
accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way and
the dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter
genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers by as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated the transition to the sport of
window breaking and thence to the plundering of public houses was easy
and natural at last after several hours when sundry summer houses had
been pulled down and some area railings had been torn up to arm
the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the guards were
coming before this rumour the crowd gradually melted away and perhaps
the guards came and perhaps they never came and this was the usual
mr cruncher did not assist at the closing sports but had remained
behind in the churchyard to confer and condole with the undertakers
the place had a soothing influence on him he procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public house and smoked it looking in at the railings and
jerry said mr cruncher apostrophising himself in his usual way
you see that there cly that day and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young un and a straight made un
having smoked his pipe out and ruminated a little longer he turned
himself about that he might appear before the hour of closing on his
station at tellsons whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man is not so much to the purpose as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser a distinguished surgeon on his way back
young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest and reported no
job in his absence the bank closed the ancient clerks came out the
usual watch was set and mr cruncher and his son went home to tea
now i tell you where it is said mr cruncher to his wife on
entering if as a honest tradesman my wenturs goes wrong to night i
shall make sure that youve been praying again me and i shall work you
for it just the same as if i seen you do it
why youre at it afore my face said mr cruncher with signs of
well then dont meditate nothing you might as well flop as meditate
you may as well go again me one way as another drop it altogether
yes jerry repeated mr cruncher sitting down to tea ah it is
yes jerry thats about it you may say yes jerry
mr cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations
but made use of them as people not unfrequently do to express general
you and your yes jerry said mr cruncher taking a bite out of his
bread and butter and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer ah i think so i believe you
you are going out to night asked his decent wife when he took
may i go with you father asked his son briskly
no you maynt im a going as your mother knows a fishing thats
your fishing rod gets rayther rusty dont it father
if i dont youll have short commons to morrow returned that
gentleman shaking his head thats questions enough for you i aint a
he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on mrs cruncher and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage with this view he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections the devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife it was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story
and mind you said mr cruncher no games to morrow if i as a
honest tradesman succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two none
of your not touching of it and sticking to bread if i as a honest
tradesman am able to provide a little beer none of your declaring
on water when you go to rome do as rome does rome will be a ugly
customer to you if you dont im your rome you know
with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink i dont
know how scarce you maynt make the wittles and drink here by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct look at your boy he is
yourn aint he hes as thin as a lath do you call yourself a mother
and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boy out
this touched young jerry on a tender place who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglected above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent
thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family until young jerry
was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similar injunctions
obeyed them mr cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
oclock towards that small and ghostly hour he rose up from his chair
took a key out of his pocket opened a locked cupboard and brought
forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other
fishing tackle of that nature disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs cruncher
young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed was not long after his father under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the
court followed out into the streets he was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the
impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to house fronts
walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his
honoured parent in view the honoured parent steering northward had not
gone far when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton and
within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the
winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a
lonely road another fisherman was picked up here and that so silently
that if young jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split
the three went on and young jerry went on until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall surmounted by an iron railing in the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which
the wall there risen to some eight or ten feet high formed one side
crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that
young jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an iron gate
he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the
third they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay
there a little listening perhaps then they moved away on their hands
it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate which he did
holding his breath crouching down again in a corner there and looking
in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass
and all the gravestones in the churchyard it was a large churchyard
that they were in looking on like ghosts in white while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant they did not
creep far before they stopped and stood upright and then they began to
they fished with a spade at first presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew
whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off
with his hair as stiff as his fathers
but his long cherished desire to know more about these matters not
only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again they
were still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time but now they seemed to have got a bite there was a
screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were
strained as if by a weight by slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it and came to the surface young jerry very well knew what
it would be but when he saw it and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open he was so frightened being new to the sight that he
made off again and never stopped until he had run a mile or more
he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran and one highly desirable
to get to the end of he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him and pictured as hopping on behind him bolt
upright upon its narrow end always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side perhaps taking his arm it was a pursuer to
shun it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too for while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boys kite without tail and wings it hid in doorways
too rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them up
to its ears as if it were laughing it got into shadows on the road
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up all this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead and even then
it would not leave him but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair scrambled into bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on
from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father in the
family room something had gone wrong with him at least so young jerry
inferred from the circumstance of his holding mrs cruncher by the
ears and knocking the back of her head against the head board of the
i told you i would said mr cruncher and i did
you oppose yourself to the profit of the business said jerry and me
and my partners suffer you was to honour and obey why the devil dont
i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested with tears
is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business
you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry
its enough for you retorted mr cruncher to be the wife of a
honest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didnt a honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether call yourself a religious
woman if youre a religious woman give me a irreligious one you have
no more natral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has
of a pile and similarly it must be knocked into you
the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminated in
the honest tradesmans kicking off his clay soiled boots and lying down
at his length on the floor after taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay
there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else mr
cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an iron pot lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs cruncher in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace he was brushed
and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son to pursue his
young jerry walking with the stool under his arm at his fathers side
along sunny and crowded fleet street was a very different young jerry
from him of the previous night running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer his cunning was fresh with the day
and his qualms were gone with the night in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in fleet street and the city of london
father said young jerry as they walked along taking care to keep
at arms length and to have the stool well between them whats a
mr cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered how

hat to give his spikes free play hes a tradesman

persons bodies aint it father asked the lively boy

mr cruncher was soothed but shook his head in a dubious and moral way
it depends upon how you dewelop your talents be careful to dewelop
your talents and never to say no more than you can help to nobody and
theres no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for as young jerry thus encouraged went on a few yards in advance
to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar mr cruncher added to
himself jerry you honest tradesman theres hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you and a recompense to you for his mother
there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur
defarge as early as six oclock in the morning sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within bending over
measures of wine monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time a sour wine moreover or a souring for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy no
vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur
defarge but a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark lay hidden in
this had been the third morning in succession on which there had been
early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge it had begun
on monday and here was wednesday come there had been more of early
brooding than drinking for many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls these
were to the full as interested in the place however as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine and they glided from seat to seat
and from corner to corner swallowing talk in lieu of drink with greedy
notwithstanding an unusual flow of company the master of the wine shop
was not visible he was not missed for nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him nobody asked for him nobody wondered to see
only madame defarge in her seat presiding over the distribution of
wine with a bowl of battered small coins before her as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come
a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine shop as they looked in
at every place high and low from the kings palace to the criminals
gaol games at cards languished players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
thus saint antoine in this vinous feature of his until midday it was
high noontide when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps of whom one was monsieur defarge the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap all adust and athirst the two entered
the wine shop their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of saint antoine fast spreading as they came along which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows yet no one had
followed them and no man spoke when they entered the wine shop though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them
it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue it elicited
it is bad weather gentlemen said defarge shaking his head
upon which every man looked at his neighbour and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent except one man who got up and went out
my wife said defarge aloud addressing madame defarge i have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads called
jacques i met him by accident a day and halfs journey out of paris
he is a good child this mender of roads called jacques give him to
a second man got up and went out madame defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called jacques who doffed his blue cap to the company
and drank in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread he ate of this between whiles and sat munching and drinking near
madame defarges counter a third man got up and went out
defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine but he took less
than was given to the stranger as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast
he looked at no one present and no one now looked at him not even
madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and was at work
have you finished your repast friend he asked in due season
come then you shall see the apartment that i told you you could
occupy it will suit you to a marvel
out of the wine shop into the street out of the street into a
courtyard out of the courtyard up a steep staircase out of the
staircase into a garret formerly the garret where a white haired man
sat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes
no white haired man was there now but the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine shop singly and between them and the white haired
man afar off was the one small link that they had once looked in at
defarge closed the door carefully and spoke in a subdued voice
jacques one jacques two jacques three this is the witness
encountered by appointment by me jacques four he will tell you all
the mender of roads blue cap in hand wiped his swarthy forehead with
it and said where shall i commence monsieur
commence was monsieur defarges not unreasonable reply at the
i saw him then messieurs began the mender of roads a year ago this
running summer underneath the carriage of the marquis hanging by the
chain behold the manner of it i leaving my work on the road the sun
going to bed the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill he
again the mender of roads went through the whole performance in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
jacques one struck in and asked if he had ever seen the man before
never answered the mender of roads recovering his perpendicular
jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then
by his tall figure said the mender of roads softly and with his
finger at his nose when monsieur the marquis demands that evening
say what is he like i make response tall as a spectre
you should have said short as a dwarf returned jacques two
but what did i know the deed was not then accomplished neither did he
confide in me observe under those circumstances even i do not
offer my testimony monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger
standing near our little fountain and says to me bring that rascal
he is right there jacques murmured defarge to him who had
good said the mender of roads with an air of mystery the tall man
is lost and he is sought how many months nine ten eleven
no matter the number said defarge he is well hidden but at last
i am again at work upon the hill side and the sun is again about to
go to bed i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below where it is already dark when i raise my eyes and see
coming over the hill six soldiers in the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound tied to his sides like this
with the aid of his indispensable cap he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips with cords that were knotted behind him
i stand aside messieurs by my heap of stones to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road that where any
spectacle is well worth looking at and at first as they approach i
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound and
that they are almost black to my sight except on the side of the sun
going to bed where they have a red edge messieurs also i see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road and are on the hill above it and are like the shadows of giants
also i see that they are covered with dust and that the dust moves
with them as they come tramp tramp but when they advance quite near
to me i recognise the tall man and he recognises me ah but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill side once again as
on the evening when he and i first encountered close to the same spot
he described it as if he were there and it was evident that he saw it
vividly perhaps he had not seen much in his life
