give in the other he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes
opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his
description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were
little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense
of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first
disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered
that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every
variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities
and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and
so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made
her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take
leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern
in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object she could think only of her letter
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having
been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return
brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had
she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her
ladyships indignation would have been what would she have said how
would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure
you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly
attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to
me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the
dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits and immediately accounting for it by herself by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon she added
but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied
elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected
you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there
can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly
but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay
another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room
for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i
should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our
lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant
with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper
you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly
guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her
having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of
mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those
things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i
am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone
my uncle is to send a servant for us
oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things where shall you change horses
oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so
occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it
as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary
walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she
studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different when she remembered the style of his address
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against
herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past
behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin
they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at
them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right
herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence
what chance could there be of improvement catherine weak spirited
irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always
affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would
scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while
there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys
explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion
heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved
to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how
grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every
respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had
been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family
when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams
character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent
there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the
work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them
a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain
manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we
see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with
charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her
feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling
it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and
from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to
lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you
see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge
that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you
have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be
as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang
poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she
had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her
home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their
dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels
placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate
parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his
compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her
in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed
when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems
but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice
elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to conceal
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners
house where they were to remain a few days
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried
into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of  in hertfordshire
and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage
was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans
punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming
is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the
money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing
her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think
it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect
unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and
when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i
think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what
one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to
go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed
and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down at
table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the
waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad
he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for
my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is it not
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe
and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was
ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their
boxes work bags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and
how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia i am glad i bought my
bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now
let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way
home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any
flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty my aunt phillips wants you so to
get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend
the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so
she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen
was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we
dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny
and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they
did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs
forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect
something and then they soon found out what was the matter
with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did
lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she
could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name
their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
i am glad you are come back lizzy
their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that
occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat
some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger
lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun
as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there
was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty
had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved
very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated
you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never
should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then
we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister
to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for
but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers
there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing mr
wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the
comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton
scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under
frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be
surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly
ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me
you do not blame me however for refusing him
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did
but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though
grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and
seek to clear the one without involving the other
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied
with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so
very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only
consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing
of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion
makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy and
with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say
that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there
is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i
ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your opinion
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public on the contrary every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy
is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal
to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to
re establish a character we must not make him desperate
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight
and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish
to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind
of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other
half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend here was knowledge in which no one
could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very
improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to
tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real
state of her sisters spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself
in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment
and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance
and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of
this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody i told my sister phillips so the other day but
i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is
a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose theres the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of
his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired of
i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more
oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i
would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will
die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the
collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope
it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an
excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her
mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their
a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will
take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed
for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it as
quite their own i dare say whenever that happens
it was a subject which they could not mention before me
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me
the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was
the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost
universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink
and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel
millers regiment went away i thought i should have broken my heart
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so
a little sea bathing would set me up forever
and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys
objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she
received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of
the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a
very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster
the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely
to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones
congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia
said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much
right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make
her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general
behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must
be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said
lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and
imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away
some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not
of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining our
importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character
will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger
kitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain
ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly
sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will
keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find
women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow
many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion
continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret
over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye
of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young
and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she
saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six
had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have
been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been
frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty
well over the agitations of formal partiality entirely so she had even
learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present
behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after
what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever
cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined
with other of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three
weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments
recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen
him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man
asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added
how long did you say he was at rosings
his manners are very different from his cousins
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves upon acquaintance
indeed cried mr wickham with a look which did not escape her and
pray may i ask  but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is
it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower
and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials
oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from
knowing him better his disposition was better understood
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his
embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of
you who so well know my feeling towards mr darcy will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction
may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been
alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe his fear of her has always
operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i
am certain he has very much at heart
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge
him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his
side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton
from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the
only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in
the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect
esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of
the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her
fathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but
respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties
abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers
of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what
has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the
present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the
scheme every part of it would have been perfect
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and
always very short those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library where such and such officers
had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which
she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going off to
the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still
less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good
humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore
a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of
june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again
within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up
the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the
present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where
they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of
