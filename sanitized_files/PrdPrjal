mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in
meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he
comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was
going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said
i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present
report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from
any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that
i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes
alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in
derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial
to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed
more unequal than she had often seen them
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents
about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you
no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i
went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in
nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to
tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society
let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i
am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will
make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her
husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before
they did as the day of his arrival drew near
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it
would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well
but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over
i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it
is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have
mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent
hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window
enter the paddock and ride towards the house
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely
kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went
to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before mr whats his name that tall proud man
good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of
mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable
enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their
mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either
of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused
and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive
information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an
interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as
what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his
coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to
lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little
paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the
gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with
tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down
again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she
had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and
she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as
she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question
which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he
was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but
it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but
the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when
they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry
could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come
she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to
she inquired after his sister but could do no more
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope
it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my
own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have
seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know
though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately
george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it did you see it
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married
continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to
newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay
i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have
heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the
regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such
misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her
however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually
done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present a few weeks he believed
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr
bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and
will save all the best of the covies for you
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious
attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to
be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her
former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he
found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and
as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged
that she did not always know when she was silent
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her
intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when
you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure
you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when
he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if
he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly
easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly
seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in
the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good
humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two
who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the
dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by
her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore
to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to
hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half laughing
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an
admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded
elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his
own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the
consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in
no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to
advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind
and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious
and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the
gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table
where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper
the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with
her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself and she seized the opportunity of saying
and quite alone have all her friends left her
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse
with her he might have better success he stood by her however for
some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies
all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had
nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others and she had no opportunity of detaining them
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what
say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well
i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the
venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater
beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and
what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her
at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good
a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls
and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of
bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy
humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the
party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had
any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and
how hard it is in some cases to be believed
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to
instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive
me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his
friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in
ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably
good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many
expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky
he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would
give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressing
gown and with her hair half finished crying out
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is
come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss
bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his
custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of
the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any
impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last
kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do
you keep winking at me for what am i to do
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still
five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she
suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to
speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look
at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her
entreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs
bennet half opened the door and called out
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned
mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every
thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the
mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went
away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband
after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent
the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into
silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner
and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter
to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she
saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of
both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would
have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she
thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as
well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few
words to her sister ran out of the room
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give
pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest
emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world
tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth
a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be
i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family how shall i bear so much happiness
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the
card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious
circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with
great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections
and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of
jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of
miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as
made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped
her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when
mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are
each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so
easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will
i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you
talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely
more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so
happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it
would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when
he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was
that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that
wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her
favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough
detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he
always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of
her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed
i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see
as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will
learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we
can never be what we once were to each other
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever
heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november
he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and
the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for
though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried
jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed
above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as
you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your
happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very
good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips
and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been
formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses
were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that
somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the
shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no
other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the
head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting
for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your
and that i suppose is one of your sisters
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man
who i believe will soon become a part of the family
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and
yes very well i saw them the night before last
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely
declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth
miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you
go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the
different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol
attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the
hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and
drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her
waiting woman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my
journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i
indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may
choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such
moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that
you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon
afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i
know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved
on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring
with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far what could your ladyship propose by it
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth
coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report
if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may
ask questions which i shall not choose to answer
this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has
he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his
reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such
language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this
let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the
presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is
engaged to my daughter now what have you to say
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy
they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of
his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to
the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make
another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes
miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will
be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that
score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will
i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons
whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable
but it will have no effect on me
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal
side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable
honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on
both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections
or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you
were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother
who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does
not object to them they can be nothing to you
tell me once for all are you engaged to him
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement
i will make no promise of the kind
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that
i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry
your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their
marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg
therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous
elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a
patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is
such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of his
late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are
you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted
you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered
you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to
and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew
unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody
lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments
