defarge got upon the box and gave the word to the barrier the
postilion cracked his whip and they clattered away under the feeble
under the over swinging lamps swinging ever brighter in the better
streets and ever dimmer in the worse and by lighted shops gay crowds
illuminated coffee houses and theatre doors to one of the city
gates soldiers with lanterns at the guard house there your papers
travellers see here then monsieur the officer said defarge
getting down and taking him gravely apart these are the papers of
monsieur inside with the white head they were consigned to me with
him at the  he dropped his voice there was a flutter among the
military lanterns and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform the eyes connected with the arm looked not an every day
or an every night look at monsieur with the white head it is well
forward from the uniform adieu from defarge and so under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over swinging lamps out under the great
beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights some so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done the shadows of the night were broad and black
all through the cold and restless interval until dawn they once more
whispered in the ears of mr jarvis lorry sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him and what were capable of restoration the old inquiry
i hope you care to be recalled to life
tellsons bank by temple bar was an old fashioned place even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty it was very small very
dark very ugly very incommodious it was an old fashioned place
moreover in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were
proud of its smallness proud of its darkness proud of its ugliness
proud of its incommodiousness they were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars and were fired by an express conviction that if
it were less objectionable it would be less respectable this was
no passive belief but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business tellsons they said wanted
no elbow room tellsons wanted no light tellsons wanted no
embellishment noakes and cos might or snooks brothers might but
any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding tellsons in this respect the house was much
on a par with the country which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
thus it had come to pass that tellsons was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat you fell into tellsons down two steps
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop with two little
counters where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows which were always under a shower bath of mud from fleet street
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper and the
heavy shadow of temple bar if your business necessitated your seeing
the house you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back
where you meditated on a misspent life until the house came with its
hands in its pockets and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight your money came out of or went into wormy old wooden
drawers particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut your bank notes had a musty odour as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two your deeds got into extemporised strong rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking house air your lighter boxes of family
papers went up stairs into a barmecide room that always had a great
dining table in it and never had a dinner and where even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty the first letters written to you
by your old love or by your little children were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows by the heads
exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
but indeed at that time putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions and not least of all with tellsons
death is natures remedy for all things and why not legislations
accordingly the forger was put to death the utterer of a bad note
was put to death the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death the holder
of a horse at tellsons door who made off with it was put to
death the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death the sounders of
three fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime were put to
death not that it did the least good in the way of prevention it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse but it cleared off as to this world the trouble of each
particular case and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after thus tellsons in its day like greater places of business
its contemporaries had taken so many lives that if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately
disposed of they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had in a rather significant manner
cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellsons the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely when they took a young
man into tellsons london house they hid him somewhere till he was
old they kept him in a dark place like a cheese until he had the full
tellson flavour and blue mould upon him then only was he permitted to
be seen spectacularly poring over large books and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment
outside tellsons never by any means in it unless called in was an
odd job man an occasional porter and messenger who served as the live
sign of the house he was never absent during business hours unless
upon an errand and then he was represented by his son a grisly urchin
of twelve who was his express image people understood that tellsons
in a stately way tolerated the odd job man the house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post his surname was cruncher and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness in the
easterly parish church of hounsditch he had received the added
the scene was mr crunchers private lodging in hanging sword alley
whitefriars the time half past seven of the clock on a windy march
morning anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty mr cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes apparently under
the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it
mr crunchers apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood and were
but two in number even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one but they were very decently kept early as
it was on the windy march morning the room in which he lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast and the lumbering deal table a very clean white cloth
mr cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane like a harlequin
at home at first he slept heavily but by degrees began to roll
and surge in bed until he rose above the surface with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons at which juncture he
bust me if she aint at it agin
a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
what said mr cruncher looking out of bed for a boot youre at it
after hailing the morn with this second salutation he threw a boot at
the woman as a third it was a very muddy boot and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with mr crunchers domestic economy that
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay
what said mr cruncher varying his apostrophe after missing his
saying your prayers youre a nice woman what do you mean by flopping
i was not praying against you i was praying for you
you werent and if you were i wont be took the liberty with here
your mothers a nice woman young jerry going a praying agin your
fathers prosperity youve got a dutiful mother you have my son
youve got a religious mother you have my boy going and flopping
herself down and praying that the bread and butter may be snatched out
master cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill and turning
to his mother strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
and what do you suppose you conceited female said mr cruncher with
unconscious inconsistency that the worth of your prayers may be
name the price that you put your prayers at
they only come from the heart jerry they are worth no more than
worth no more than that repeated mr cruncher they aint worth
much then whether or no i wont be prayed agin i tell you i cant
afford it im not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking if
you must go flopping yourself down flop in favour of your husband and
child and not in opposition to em if i had had any but a unnatral
wife and this poor boy had had any but a unnatral mother i might
have made some money last week instead of being counter prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck
b u u ust me said mr cruncher who all this time had been putting
on his clothes if i aint what with piety and one blowed thing and
another been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with young jerry dress yourself my
boy and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then and if you see any signs of more flopping give me a call for i
tell you here he addressed his wife once more i wont be gone agin
in this manner i am as rickety as a hackney coach im as sleepy as
laudanum my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldnt know if
it wasnt for the pain in em which was me and which somebody else yet
im none the better for it in pocket and its my suspicion that youve
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket and i wont put up with it aggerawayter and what do you
growling in addition such phrases as ah yes youre religious too
you wouldnt put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child would you not you and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation mr cruncher betook
himself to his boot cleaning and his general preparation for business
in the meantime his son whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes
and whose young eyes stood close by one another as his fathers did
kept the required watch upon his mother he greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals by darting out of his sleeping closet where he made
his toilet with a suppressed cry of you are going to flop mother
halloa father and after raising this fictitious alarm darting in
mr crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast he resented mrs crunchers saying grace with particular
now aggerawayter what are you up to at it again
his wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing
dont do it said mr crunches looking about as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wifes petitions i
aint a going to be blest out of house and home i wont have my wittles
exceedingly red eyed and grim as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn jerry cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it growling over it like any four footed
inmate of a menagerie towards nine oclock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect and presenting as respectable and business like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with issued forth to the occupation
it could scarcely be called a trade in spite of his favourite
description of himself as a honest tradesman his stock consisted of
a wooden stool made out of a broken backed chair cut down which stool
young jerry walking at his fathers side carried every morning to
beneath the banking house window that was nearest temple bar where
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd job mans
feet it formed the encampment for the day on this post of his mr
cruncher was as well known to fleet street and the temple as the bar
encamped at a quarter before nine in good time to touch his
three cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellsons
jerry took up his station on this windy march morning with young jerry
standing by him when not engaged in making forays through the bar to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose father and son
extremely like each other looking silently on at the morning traffic
in fleet street with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys
the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance that
the mature jerry bit and spat out straw while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellsons
establishment was put through the door and the word was given
hooray father heres an early job to begin with
having thus given his parent god speed young jerry seated himself on
the stool entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
al ways rusty his fingers is al ways rusty muttered young jerry
where does my father get all that iron rust from he dont get no iron
you know the old bailey well no doubt said one of the oldest of
ye es sir returned jerry in something of a dogged manner i do
i know mr lorry sir much better than i know the bailey much
better said jerry not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question than i as a honest tradesman wish to know the bailey
very well find the door where the witnesses go in and show the
door keeper this note for mr lorry he will then let you in
mr crunchers eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another and to
interchange the inquiry what do you think of this
am i to wait in the court sir he asked as the result of that
i am going to tell you the door keeper will pass the note to mr
lorry and do you make any gesture that will attract mr lorrys
attention and show him where you stand then what you have to do is
thats all he wishes to have a messenger at hand this is to tell him
as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note
mr cruncher after surveying him in silence until he came to the
i suppose theyll be trying forgeries this morning
it is the law remarked the ancient clerk turning his surprised
its hard in the law to spile a man i think its hard enough to kill
him but its wery hard to spile him sir
not at all retained the ancient clerk speak well of the law take
care of your chest and voice my good friend and leave the law to take
care of itself i give you that advice
its the damp sir what settles on my chest and voice said jerry i
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is
well well said the old clerk we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood some of us have damp ways and some of us have dry
jerry took the letter and remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of you are a lean old one
too made his bow informed his son in passing of his destination
they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outside newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it
but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised and where dire diseases were bred that came
into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulled him off the bench it
had more than once happened that the judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him
for the rest the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn yard
from which pale travellers set out continually in carts and coaches on
a violent passage into the other world traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road and shaming few good citizens if any
so powerful is use and so desirable to be good use in the beginning it
was famous too for the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent also for
the whipping post another dear old institution very humanising and
softening to behold in action also for extensive transactions in
blood money another fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under heaven altogether the old bailey at that date was a choice
illustration of the precept that whatever is is right an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy did it not include the troublesome
consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong
making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought and handed in
his letter through a trap in it for people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play in bedlam only the
former entertainment was much the dearer therefore all the old bailey
doors were well guarded except indeed the social doors by which the
criminals got there and those were always left wide open
after some delay and demur the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way and allowed mr jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into
whats on he asked in a whisper of the man he found himself next
ah returned the man with a relish hell be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged and then hell be taken down and sliced before his own
face and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on
and then his head will be chopped off and hell be cut into quarters
if hes found guilty you mean to say jerry added by way of proviso
oh theyll find him guilty said the other dont you be afraid of
mr crunchers attention was here diverted to the door keeper whom he
saw making his way to mr lorry with the note in his hand mr lorry
sat at a table among the gentlemen in wigs not far from a wigged
gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundle of papers
before him and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets whose whole attention when mr cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand jerry attracted the notice of mr lorry who had stood up
to look for him and who quietly nodded and sat down again
whats he got to do with the case asked the man he had spoken with
what have you got to do with it then if a person may inquire
blest if i know that either said jerry
the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court stopped the dialogue presently the dock became the
central point of interest two gaolers who had been standing there
went out and the prisoner was brought in and put to the bar
everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling stared at him all the human breath in the place rolled
at him like a sea or a wind or a fire eager faces strained round
pillars and corners to get a sight of him spectators in back rows
stood up not to miss a hair of him people on the floor of the court
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them to help
themselves at anybodys cost to a view of him stood a tiptoe got
upon ledges stood upon next to nothing to see every inch of him
conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of newgate jerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer and gin and tea and coffee and what not
that flowed at him and already broke upon the great windows behind him
the object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of about
five and twenty well grown and well looking with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye his condition was that of a young gentleman he was plainly
dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which was long and
dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck more to be out
of his way than for ornament as an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun he was otherwise quite self possessed
the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at
was not a sort that elevated humanity had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled
was the sight the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder yielded the sensation whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest according to their several arts and
powers of self deceit the interest was at the root of it ogreish
silence in the court charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to
an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle and jangle for that
he was a false traitor to our serene illustrious excellent and so
forth prince our lord the king by reason of his having on divers
occasions and by divers means and ways assisted lewis the french
king in his wars against our said serene illustrious excellent and
so forth that was to say by coming and going between the dominions of
our said serene illustrious excellent and so forth and those of the
said french lewis and wickedly falsely traitorously and otherwise
evil adverbiously revealing to the said french lewis what forces our
said serene illustrious excellent and so forth had in preparation
to send to canada and north america this much jerry with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it made out with
huge satisfaction and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid and over and over again aforesaid charles darnay stood
there before him upon his trial that the jury were swearing in and
that mr attorney general was making ready to speak
the accused who was and who knew he was being mentally hanged
beheaded and quartered by everybody there neither flinched from
the situation nor assumed any theatrical air in it he was quiet and
attentive watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him so
composedly that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever
over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light down
upon him crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it and had passed from its surface and this earths together haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved may have struck the prisoners mind be
that as it may a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face he looked up and when he saw the glass his
face flushed and his right hand pushed the herbs away
it happened that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left about on a level with his eyes there sat
in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested so immediately and so much to the changing of his
aspect that all the eyes that were turned upon him turned to them
the spectators saw in the two figures a young lady of little more than
twenty and a gentleman who was evidently her father a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair
and a certain indescribable intensity of face not of an active kind
but pondering and self communing when this expression was upon him he
looked as if he were old but when it was stirred and broken up as
it was now in a moment on his speaking to his daughter he became a
handsome man not past the prime of life
his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm as she sat by
him and the other pressed upon it she had drawn close to him in her
dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused this had been so very
noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shown that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her and the whisper went about
jerry the messenger who had made his own observations in his own
manner and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption stretched his neck to hear who they were the crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back at last it got
the judge whose eyes had gone in the general direction recalled them
leaned back in his seat and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand as mr attorney general rose to spin the rope grind the
axe and hammer the nails into the scaffold
mr attorney general had to inform the jury that the prisoner before
them though young in years was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life that this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to day or of yesterday or
even of last year or of the year before that it was certain the
prisoner had for longer than that been in the habit of passing and
repassing between france and england on secret business of which
he could give no honest account that if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered
that providence however had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach to ferret out the nature of the
prisoners schemes and struck with horror to disclose them to his
majestys chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council
that this patriot would be produced before them that his position and
attitude were on the whole sublime that he had been the prisoners
friend but at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom on the sacred altar of his country that if statues
were decreed in britain as in ancient greece and rome to public
benefactors this shining citizen would assuredly have had one that as
they were not so decreed he probably would not have one that virtue
as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have word for word at the tips of their tongues
whereat the jurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages was in a manner contagious more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love of country
that the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the crown to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour had
communicated itself to the prisoners servant and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his masters table drawers and pockets
and secrete his papers that he mr attorney general was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant but that
in a general way he preferred him to his mr attorney generals
brothers and sisters and honoured him more than his mr
attorney generals father and mother that he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise that the evidence of these two
witnesses coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his majestys forces and of their disposition and preparation both by
sea and land and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power that these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoners handwriting but that it was all the
same that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions that the proof
would go back five years and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the british troops and the americans
that for these reasons the jury being a loyal jury as he knew they
were and being a responsible jury as they knew they were must
positively find the prisoner guilty and make an end of him whether
they liked it or not that they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows that they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows that they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows in short that
there never more could be for them or theirs any laying of heads upon
pillows at all unless the prisoners head was taken off that head
mr attorney general concluded by demanding of them in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
when the attorney general ceased a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue flies were swarming about the prisoner in
anticipation of what he was soon to become when toned down again the
mr solicitor general then following his leaders lead examined the
patriot john barsad gentleman by name the story of his pure soul was
exactly what mr attorney general had described it to be perhaps if
it had a fault a little too exactly having released his noble bosom
of its burden he would have modestly withdrawn himself but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him sitting not far from mr
lorry begged to ask him a few questions the wigged gentleman sitting
opposite still looking at the ceiling of the court
had he ever been a spy himself no he scorned the base insinuation
what did he live upon his property where was his property he didnt
precisely remember where it was what was it no business of anybodys
had he inherited it yes he had from whom distant relation very
distant rather ever been in prison certainly not never in a debtors
prison didnt see what that had to do with it never in a debtors
prison come once again never yes how many times two or three
times not five or six perhaps of what profession gentleman ever
been kicked might have been frequently no ever kicked downstairs
decidedly not once received a kick on the top of a staircase and fell
downstairs of his own accord kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault but it was not true swear it was not true
positively ever live by cheating at play never ever live by play not
more than other gentlemen do ever borrow money of the prisoner yes
ever pay him no was not this intimacy with the prisoner in reality a
very slight one forced upon the prisoner in coaches inns and packets
no sure he saw the prisoner with these lists certain knew no more
about the lists no had not procured them himself for instance no
expect to get anything by this evidence no not in regular government
pay and employment to lay traps oh dear no or to do anything oh dear
no swear that over and over again no motives but motives of sheer
the virtuous servant roger cly swore his way through the case at a
great rate he had taken service with the prisoner in good faith and
simplicity four years ago he had asked the prisoner aboard the calais
packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner had engaged him
he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity never thought of such a thing he began to have suspicions of
the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soon afterwards in arranging
his clothes while travelling he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoners pockets over and over again he had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoners desk he had not put them there first he
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen
at calais and similar lists to french gentlemen both at calais and
boulogne he loved his country and couldnt bear it and had given
information he had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea pot
he had been maligned respecting a mustard pot but it turned out to be
only a plated one he had known the last witness seven or eight years
that was merely a coincidence he didnt call it a particularly curious
coincidence most coincidences were curious neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too he
was a true briton and hoped there were many like him
the blue flies buzzed again and mr attorney general called mr jarvis
mr jarvis lorry are you a clerk in tellsons bank
on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and
seventy five did business occasion you to travel between london and
were there any other passengers in the mail
did they alight on the road in the course of the night
mr lorry look upon the prisoner was he one of those two passengers
i cannot undertake to say that he was
does he resemble either of these two passengers
both were so wrapped up and the night was so dark and we were all so
reserved that i cannot undertake to say even that
mr lorry look again upon the prisoner supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them
you will not swear mr lorry that he was not one of them
so at least you say he may have been one of them
yes except that i remember them both to have been like
myself timorous of highwaymen and the prisoner has not a timorous
did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity mr lorry
mr lorry look once more upon the prisoner have you seen him to your
i was returning from france a few days afterwards and at calais the
prisoner came on board the packet ship in which i returned and made the
at what hour did he come on board
in the dead of the night was he the only passenger who came on board
never mind about happening mr lorry he was the only passenger who
came on board in the dead of the night
were you travelling alone mr lorry or with any companion
with two companions a gentleman and lady they are here
they are here had you any conversation with the prisoner
hardly any the weather was stormy and the passage long and rough and
i lay on a sofa almost from shore to shore
the young lady to whom all eyes had been turned before and were now
turned again stood up where she had sat her father rose with her and
to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth and beauty was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd
standing as it were apart with her on the edge of his grave not all
the staring curiosity that looked on could for the moment nerve him
to remain quite still his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart the buzz of the great flies was loud again
miss manette have you seen the prisoner before
on board of the packet ship just now referred to sir and on the same
you are the young lady just now referred to
the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the judge as he said something fiercely answer the questions put
to you and make no remark upon them
miss manette had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
in the midst of a profound stillness she faintly began when the
do you mean the prisoner inquired the judge knitting his brows
when the prisoner came on board he noticed that my father turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health my father was so reduced that i was
afraid to take him out of the air and i had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps and i sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him there were no other passengers that night but we four
the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could
shelter my father from the wind and weather better than i had done i
had not known how to do it well not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour he did it for me he expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my fathers state and i am sure he
felt it that was the manner of our beginning to speak together
let me interrupt you for a moment had he come on board alone
they had conferred together until the last moment when it was
necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat
had any papers been handed about among them similar to these lists
some papers had been handed about among them but i dont know what
possibly but indeed i dont know although they stood whispering very
near to me because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there it was a dull lamp and they
spoke very low and i did not hear what they said and saw only that
the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me which arose out
of my helpless situation as he was kind and good and useful to my
father i hope bursting into tears i may not repay him by doing him
miss manette if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give which you must
give and which you cannot escape from giving with great unwillingness
he is the only person present in that condition please to go on
he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name he said that this business
had within a few days taken him to france and might at intervals
take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long
did he say anything about america miss manette be particular
he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen and he said
that so far as he could judge it was a wrong and foolish one on
englands part he added in a jesting way that perhaps george
washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the
third but there was no harm in his way of saying this it was said
any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence and in the pauses when
she stopped for the judge to write it down watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against among the lookers on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court insomuch that a great majority
of the foreheads there might have been mirrors reflecting the witness
when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
mr attorney general now signified to my lord that he deemed it
necessary as a matter of precaution and form to call the young ladys
doctor manette look upon the prisoner have you ever seen him before
once when he called at my lodgings in london some three years or
can you identify him as your fellow passenger on board the packet or
is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
he answered in a low voice there is
has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment without
trial or even accusation in your native country doctor manette
he answered in a tone that went to every heart a long imprisonment
were you newly released on the occasion in question
none my mind is a blank from some time i cannot even say what
time when i employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to the
time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter
here she had become familiar to me when a gracious god restored
my faculties but i am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar i have no remembrance of the process
mr attorney general sat down and the father and daughter sat down
a singular circumstance then arose in the case the object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down with some fellow plotter untracked
in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago and
got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did
not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more
to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required
in the coffee room of an hotel in that garrison and dockyard town
waiting for another person the prisoners counsel was cross examining
this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him opening
this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great
you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner
did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner
not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken
look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the
prisoner how say you are they very like each other
allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise
not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought
into comparison my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became
much more remarkable my lord inquired of mr stryver the prisoners
counsel whether they were next to try mr carton name of my learned
friend for treason but mr stryver replied to my lord no but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might
happen twice whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so
confident having seen it and more the upshot of which was to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to
mr cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence he had now to attend while mr
