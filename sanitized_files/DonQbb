landlord replied this is a famous puppet showman who for some time
past has been going about this mancha de aragon exhibiting a show of the
release of melisendra by the famous don gaiferos one of the best and
best represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom
for many a year he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary
gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being for if you ask him
anything he listens attentively to the question and then jumps on his
masters shoulder and pressing close to his ear tells him the answer
which master pedro then delivers he says a great deal more about things
past than about things to come and though he does not always hit the
truth in every case most times he is not far wrong so that he makes us
fancy he has got the devil in him he gets two reals for every question
if the ape answers i mean if his master answers for him after he has
whispered into his ear and so it is believed that this same master pedro
is very rich he is a gallant man as they say in italy and good
company and leads the finest life in the world talks more than six
drinks more than a dozen and all by his tongue and his ape and his
master pedro now came back and in a cart followed the show and the
ape a big one without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt but not
vicious looking as soon as don quixote saw him he asked him can you
tell me sir fortune teller what fish do we catch and how will it be
with us see here are my two reals and he bade sancho give them to
master pedro but he answered for the ape and said senor this animal
does not give any answer or information touching things that are to come
of things past he knows something and more or less of things present
gad said sancho i would not give a farthing to be told whats past
with me for who knows that better than i do myself and to pay for being
told what i know would be mighty foolish but as you know things present
here are my two reals and tell me most excellent sir ape what is my
wife teresa panza doing now and what is she diverting herself with
master pedro refused to take the money saying i will not receive
payment in advance or until the service has been first rendered and
then with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his left shoulder
and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it and putting his
mouth to his masters ear began chattering his teeth rapidly and having
kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo with another spring
he brought himself to the ground and the same instant master pedro ran
in great haste and fell upon his knees before don quixote and embracing
his legs exclaimed these legs do i embrace as i would embrace the two
pillars of hercules o illustrious reviver of knight errantry so long
consigned to oblivion o never yet duly extolled knight don quixote of
la mancha courage of the faint hearted prop of the tottering arm of
the fallen staff and counsel of all who are unfortunate
don quixote was thunderstruck sancho astounded the cousin staggered
the page astonished the man from the braying town agape the landlord in
perplexity and in short everyone amazed at the words of the
puppet showman who went on to say and thou worthy sancho panza the
best squire and squire to the best knight in the world be of good cheer
for thy good wife teresa is well and she is at this moment hackling a
pound of flax and more by token she has at her left hand a jug with a
broken spout that holds a good drop of wine with which she solaces
that i can well believe said sancho she is a lucky one and if it
was not for her jealousy i would not change her for the giantess
andandona who by my masters account was a very clever and worthy woman
my teresa is one of those that wont let themselves want for anything
though their heirs may have to pay for it
now i declare said don quixote he who reads much and travels much
sees and knows a great deal i say so because what amount of persuasion
could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine
as i have seen now with my own eyes for i am that very don quixote of la
mancha this worthy animal refers to though he has gone rather too far in
my praise but whatever i may be i thank heaven that it has endowed me
with a tender and compassionate heart always disposed to do good to all
if i had money said the page i would ask senor ape what will happen
to this master pedro who had by this time risen from don quixotes feet
replied i have already said that this little beast gives no answer as
to the future but if he did not having money would be of no
consequence for to oblige senor don quixote here present i would give
up all the profits in the world and now because i have promised it and
to afford him pleasure i will set up my show and offer entertainment to
all who are in the inn without any charge whatever as soon as he heard
this the landlord delighted beyond measure pointed out a place where
the show might be fixed which was done at once
don quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape
as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything either
past or future so while master pedro was arranging the show he retired
with sancho into a corner of the stable where without being overheard
by anyone he said to him look here sancho i have been seriously
thinking over this apes extraordinary gift and have come to the
conclusion that beyond doubt this master pedro his master has a pact
if the packet is express from the devil said sancho it must be a
very dirty packet no doubt but what good can it do master pedro to have
thou dost not understand me sancho said don quixote i only mean he
must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the
ape that he may get his living and after he has grown rich he will give
him his soul which is what the enemy of mankind wants this i am led to
believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or
present and the devils knowledge extends no further for the future he
knows only by guesswork and that not always for it is reserved for god
alone to know the times and the seasons and for him there is neither
past nor future all is present this being as it is it is clear that
this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil and i am astonished they have
not denounced him to the holy office and put him to the question and
forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that he divines because it is
certain this ape is not an astrologer neither his master nor he sets up
or knows how to set up those figures they call judiciary which are now
so common in spain that there is not a jade or page or old cobbler
that will not undertake to set up a figure as readily as pick up a knave
of cards from the ground bringing to nought the marvellous truth of the
science by their lies and ignorance i know of a lady who asked one of
these figure schemers whether her little lap dog would be in pup and
would breed and how many and of what colour the little pups would be to
which senor astrologer after having set up his figure made answer that
the bitch would be in pup and would drop three pups one green another
bright red and the third parti coloured provided she conceived between
eleven and twelve either of the day or night and on a monday or
saturday but as things turned out two days after this the bitch died of
a surfeit and senor planet ruler had the credit all over the place of
being a most profound astrologer as most of these planet rulers have
still said sancho i would be glad if your worship would make master
pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in the cave of
montesinos is true for begging your worships pardon i for my part
take it to have been all flam and lies or at any rate something you
that may be replied don quixote however i will do what you suggest
though i have my own scruples about it
at this point master pedro came up in quest of don quixote to tell him
the show was now ready and to come and see it for it was worth seeing
don quixote explained his wish and begged him to ask his ape at once to
tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of
montesinos were dreams or realities for to him they appeared to partake
of both upon this master pedro without answering went back to fetch
the ape and having placed it in front of don quixote and sancho said
see here senor ape this gentleman wishes to know whether certain
things which happened to him in the cave called the cave of montesinos
were false or true on his making the usual sign the ape mounted on his
left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear and master pedro said at
once the ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in
that cave are part of them false part true and that he only knows this
and no more as regards this question but if your worship wishes to know
more on friday next he will answer all that may be asked him for his
virtue is at present exhausted and will not return to him till friday
did i not say senor said sancho that i could not bring myself to
believe that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was
the course of events will tell sancho replied don quixote time
that discloses all things leaves nothing that it does not drag into the
light of day though it be buried in the bosom of the earth but enough
of that for the present let us go and see master pedros show for i am
sure there must be something novel in it
something said master pedro this show of mine has sixty thousand
novel things in it let me tell you senor don quixote it is one of the
best worth seeing things in the world this day but operibus credite et
non verbis and now lets get to work for it is growing late and we
have a great deal to do and to say and show
don quixote and sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already
put up and uncovered set all around with lighted wax tapers which made
it look splendid and bright when they came to it master pedro ensconced
himself inside it for it was he who had to work the puppets and a boy
a servant of his posted himself outside to act as showman and explain
the mysteries of the exhibition having a wand in his hand to point to
the figures as they came out and so all who were in the inn being
arranged in front of the show some of them standing and don quixote
sancho the page and cousin accommodated with the best places the
interpreter began to say what he will hear or see who reads or hears the
wherein is continued the droll adventure of the puppet showman together
all were silent tyrians and trojans i mean all who were watching the
show were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders when
drums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off
the noise was soon over and then the boy lifted up his voice and said
this true story which is here represented to your worships is taken word
for word from the french chronicles and from the spanish ballads that are
in everybodys mouth and in the mouth of the boys about the streets its
subject is the release by senor don gaiferos of his wife melisendra when
a captive in spain at the hands of the moors in the city of sansuena for
so they called then what is now called saragossa and there you may see
how don gaiferos is playing at the tables just as they sing it
and that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a
sceptre in his hand is the emperor charlemagne the supposed father of
melisendra who angered to see his son in laws inaction and unconcern
comes in to chide him and observe with what vehemence and energy he
chides him so that you would fancy he was going to give him half a dozen
raps with his sceptre and indeed there are authors who say he did give
them and sound ones too and after having said a great deal to him about
imperilling his honour by not effecting the release of his wife he said
observe too how the emperor turns away and leaves don gaiferos fuming
and you see now how in a burst of anger he flings the table and the
board far from him and calls in haste for his armour and asks his cousin
don roland for the loan of his sword durindana and how don roland
refuses to lend it offering him his company in the difficult enterprise
he is undertaking but he in his valour and anger will not accept it
and says that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife even though she
were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth and with this he retires
to arm himself and set out on his journey at once now let your worships
turn your eyes to that tower that appears there which is supposed to be
one of the towers of the alcazar of saragossa now called the aljaferia
that lady who appears on that balcony dressed in moorish fashion is the
peerless melisendra for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon
the road to france and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of
paris and her husband observe too a new incident which now occurs
such as perhaps never was seen do you not see that moor who silently
and stealthily with his finger on his lip approaches melisendra from
behind observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips and what a hurry
she is in to spit and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock and
how she bewails herself and tears her fair hair as though it were to
blame for the wrong observe too that the stately moor who is in that
corridor is king marsilio of sansuena who having seen the moors
insolence at once orders him though his kinsman and a great favourite
of his to be seized and given two hundred lashes while carried through
the streets of the city according to custom with criers going before him
and officers of justice behind and here you see them come out to execute
the sentence although the offence has been scarcely committed for among
the moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us
here don quixote called out child child go straight on with your
story and dont run into curves and slants for to establish a fact
clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation and
said master pedro from within boy stick to your text and do as the
gentleman bids you its the best plan keep to your plain song and
dont attempt harmonies for they are apt to break down from being over
i will said the boy and he went on to say this figure that you see
here on horseback covered with a gascon cloak is don gaiferos himself
whom his wife now avenged of the insult of the amorous moor and taking
her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more tranquil
countenance has perceived without recognising him and she addresses her
husband supposing him to be some traveller and holds with him all that
conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs
if you sir knight to france are bound
which i do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust suffice it
to observe how don gaiferos discovers himself and that by her joyful
gestures melisendra shows us she has recognised him and what is more we
now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the
haunches of her good husbands horse but ah unhappy lady the edge of
her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is
left hanging in the air unable to reach the ground but you see how
compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need don gaiferos advances
and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not he seizes
her and by force brings her to the ground and then with one jerk places
her on the haunches of his horse astraddle like a man and bids her hold
on tight and clasp her arms round his neck crossing them on his breast
so as not to fall for the lady melisendra was not used to that style of
riding you see too how the neighing of the horse shows his
satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord
and lady you see how they wheel round and quit the city and in joy and
gladness take the road to paris go in peace o peerless pair of true
lovers may you reach your longed for fatherland in safety and may
fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous journey may the eyes
of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity
the remaining days of your life and that they may be as many as those of
here master pedro called out again and said simplicity boy none of
the interpreter made no answer but went on to say there was no want of
idle eyes that see everything to see melisendra come down and mount
and word was brought to king marsilio who at once gave orders to sound
the alarm and see what a stir there is and how the city is drowned with
the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques
nay nay said don quixote at this on that point of the bells master
pedro is very inaccurate for bells are not in use among the moors only
kettledrums and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our clarion to
ring bells this way in sansuena is unquestionably a great absurdity
on hearing this master pedro stopped ringing and said dont look into
trifles senor don quixote or want to have things up to a pitch of
perfection that is out of reach are there not almost every day a
thousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of
inaccuracies and absurdities and for all that they have a successful
run and are listened to not only with applause but with admiration and
all the rest of it go on boy and dont mind for so long as i fill my
pouch no matter if i show as many inaccuracies as there are motes in a
true enough said don quixote and the boy went on see what a
numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in pursuit
of the two faithful lovers what a blowing of trumpets there is what
sounding of horns what beating of drums and tabors i fear me they will
overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own horse
don quixote however seeing such a swarm of moors and hearing such a
din thought it would be right to aid the fugitives and standing up he
exclaimed in a loud voice never while i live will i permit foul play
to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearless lover
as don gaiferos halt ill born rabble follow him not nor pursue him or
ye will have to reckon with me in battle and suiting the action to the
word he drew his sword and with one bound placed himself close to the
show and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower down blows on
the puppet troop of moors knocking over some decapitating others
maiming this one and demolishing that and among many more he delivered
one down stroke which if master pedro had not ducked made himself
small and got out of the way would have sliced off his head as easily
as if it had been made of almond paste master pedro kept shouting hold
hard senor don quixote cant you see theyre not real moors youre
knocking down and killing and destroying but only little pasteboard
figures look sinner that i am how youre wrecking and ruining all
that im worth but in spite of this don quixote did not leave off
discharging a continuous rain of cuts slashes downstrokes and
backstrokes and at length in less than the space of two credos he
brought the whole show to the ground with all its fittings and figures
shivered and knocked to pieces king marsilio badly wounded and the
emperor charlemagne with his crown and head split in two the whole
audience was thrown into confusion the ape fled to the roof of the inn
the cousin was frightened and even sancho panza himself was in mighty
fear for as he swore after the storm was over he had never seen his
the complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished don quixote
became a little calmer said i wish i had here before me now all those
who do not or will not believe how useful knights errant are in the
world just think if i had not been here present what would have become
of the brave don gaiferos and the fair melisendra depend upon it by
this time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage
upon them so then long live knight errantry beyond everything living
let it live and welcome said master pedro at this in a feeble voice
and let me die for i am so unfortunate that i can say with king don
not half an hour nay barely a minute ago i saw myself lord of kings
and emperors with my stables filled with countless horses and my trunks
and bags with gay dresses unnumbered and now i find myself ruined and
laid low destitute and a beggar and above all without my ape for by
my faith my teeth will have to sweat for it before i have him caught
and all through the reckless fury of sir knight here who they say
protects the fatherless and rights wrongs and does other charitable
deeds but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case
only blessed and praised be the highest heavens verily knight of the
rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine
sancho panza was touched by master pedros words and said to him dont
weep and lament master pedro you break my heart let me tell you my
master don quixote is so catholic and scrupulous a christian that if
he can make out that he has done you any wrong he will own it and be
willing to pay for it and make it good and something over and above
only let senor don quixote pay me for some part of the work he has
destroyed said master pedro and i would be content and his worship
would ease his conscience for he cannot be saved who keeps what is
anothers against the owners will and makes no restitution
that is true said don quixote but at present i am not aware that i
what returned master pedro and these relics lying here on the bare
hard ground what scattered and shattered them but the invincible
strength of that mighty arm and whose were the bodies they belonged to
but mine and what did i get my living by but by them
now am i fully convinced said don quixote of what i had many a time
before believed that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing more
than put figures like these before my eyes and then change and turn them
into what they please in truth and earnest i assure you gentlemen who
now hear me that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to
take place literally that melisendra was melisendra don gaiferos don
gaiferos marsilio marsilio and charlemagne charlemagne that was why my
anger was roused and to be faithful to my calling as a knight errant i
sought to give aid and protection to those who fled and with this good
intention i did what you have seen if the result has been the opposite
of what i intended it is no fault of mine but of those wicked beings
that persecute me but for all that i am willing to condemn myself in
costs for this error of mine though it did not proceed from malice let
master pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures for i agree to
pay it at once in good and current money of castile
master pedro made him a bow saying i expected no less of the rare
christianity of the valiant don quixote of la mancha true helper and
protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds master landlord here and
the great sancho panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between
your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be
the landlord and sancho consented and then master pedro picked up from
the ground king marsilio of saragossa with his head off and said here
you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state so
i think saving your better judgments that for his death decease and
demise four reals and a half may be given me
well then for this cleavage from top to bottom continued master
pedro taking up the split emperor charlemagne it would not be much if
i were to ask five reals and a quarter
nor is it much said the landlord make it even and say five reals
let him have the whole five and a quarter said don quixote for the
sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or
less and make an end of it quickly master pedro for its getting on to
supper time and i have some hints of hunger
for this figure said master pedro that is without a nose and wants
an eye and is the fair melisendra i ask and i am reasonable in my
the very devil must be in it said don quixote if melisendra and her
husband are not by this time at least on the french border for the horse
they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop so you neednt try
to sell me the cat for the hare showing me here a noseless melisendra
when she is now may be enjoying herself at her ease with her husband in
france god help every one to his own master pedro and let us all
proceed fairly and honestly and now go on
master pedro perceiving that don quixote was beginning to wander and
return to his original fancy was not disposed to let him escape so he
said to him this cannot be melisendra but must be one of the damsels
that waited on her so if im given sixty maravedis for her ill be
and so he went on putting values on ever so many more smashed figures
which after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of
both parties came to forty reals and three quarters and over and above
this sum which sancho at once disbursed master pedro asked for two
reals for his trouble in catching the ape
let him have them sancho said don quixote not to catch the ape but
to get drunk and two hundred would i give this minute for the good news
to anyone who could tell me positively that the lady dona melisandra and
senor don gaiferos were now in france and with their own people
no one could tell us that better than my ape said master pedro but
theres no devil that could catch him now i suspect however that
affection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to night but
to morrow will soon be here and we shall see
in short the puppet show storm passed off and all supped in peace and
good fellowship at don quixotes expense for he was the height of
generosity before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds
took his departure and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came
to bid don quixote farewell the former returning home the latter
resuming his journey towards which to help him don quixote gave him
twelve reals master pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver
with don quixote whom he knew right well so he rose before the sun and
having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape he too
went off to seek his adventures the landlord who did not know don
quixote was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity
to conclude sancho by his masters orders paid him very liberally and
taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning
and took to the road where we will leave them to pursue their journey
for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set
forth which are required to clear up this famous history
wherein it is shown who master pedro and his ape were together with the
mishap don quixote had in the braying adventure which he did not
conclude as he would have liked or as he had expected
cide hamete the chronicler of this great history begins this chapter
with these words i swear as a catholic christian with regard to which
his translator says that cide hametes swearing as a catholic christian
he being as no doubt he was a moor only meant that just as a catholic
christian taking an oath swears or ought to swear what is true and
tell the truth in what he avers so he was telling the truth as much as
if he swore as a catholic christian in all he chose to write about
quixote especially in declaring who master pedro was and what was the
divining ape that astonished all the villages with his divinations he
says then that he who has read the first part of this history will
remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom with other galley
slaves don quixote set free in the sierra morena a kindness for which
he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil minded
ill conditioned set this gines de pasamonte don ginesillo de parapilla
don quixote called him it was that stole dapple from sancho panza
which because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when
was stated in the first part has been a puzzle to a good many people
who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the
press in fact however gines stole him while sancho panza was asleep on
his back adopting the plan and device that brunello had recourse to when
he stole sacripantes horse from between his legs at the siege of
albracca and as has been told sancho afterwards recovered him this
gines then afraid of being caught by the officers of justice who were
looking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences
which were so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving
an account of them resolved to shift his quarters into the kingdom of
aragon and cover up his left eye and take up the trade of a
puppet showman for this as well as juggling he knew how to practise to
perfection from some released christians returning from barbary it so
happened he bought the ape which he taught to mount upon his shoulder
on his making a certain sign and to whisper or seem to do so in his
ear thus prepared before entering any village whither he was bound with
his show and his ape he used to inform himself at the nearest village
or from the most likely person he could find as to what particular
things had happened there and to whom and bearing them well in mind
the first thing he did was to exhibit his show sometimes one story
sometimes another but all lively amusing and familiar as soon as the
exhibition was over he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape
assuring the public that he divined all the past and the present but as
to the future he had no skill for each question answered he asked two
reals and for some he made a reduction just as he happened to feel the
pulse of the questioners and when now and then he came to houses where
things that he knew of had happened to the people living there even if
they did not ask him a question not caring to pay for it he would make
the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so which
fitted the case exactly in this way he acquired a prodigious name and
all ran after him on other occasions being very crafty he would answer
in such a way that the answers suited the questions and as no one
cross questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined he made
fools of them all and filled his pouch the instant he entered the inn he
knew don quixote and sancho and with that knowledge it was easy for him
to astonish them and all who were there but it would have cost him dear
had don quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off king
marsilios head and destroyed all his horsemen as related in the
so much for master pedro and his ape and now to return to don quixote of
la mancha after he had left the inn he determined to visit first of
all the banks of the ebro and that neighbourhood before entering the
city of saragossa for the ample time there was still to spare before the
jousts left him enough for all with this object in view he followed the
road and travelled along it for two days without meeting any adventure
worth committing to writing until on the third day as he was ascending a
hill he heard a great noise of drums trumpets and musket shots at
first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way and to
see them he spurred rocinante and mounted the hill on reaching the top
he saw at the foot of it over two hundred men as it seemed to him armed
with weapons of various sorts lances crossbows partisans halberds
and pikes and a few muskets and a great many bucklers he descended the
slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags
make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore especially
one on a standard or ensign of white satin on which there was painted in
a very life like style an ass like a little sard with its head up its
mouth open and its tongue out as if it were in the act and attitude of
braying and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines
from this device don quixote concluded that these people must be from the
braying town and he said so to sancho explaining to him what was
written on the standard at the same time he observed that the man who
had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who
brayed were regidors for according to the lines of the standard they
were alcaldes to which sancho replied senor theres nothing to stick
at in that for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of
their town afterwards and so they may go by both titles moreover it
has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were
alcaldes or regidors provided at any rate they did bray for an alcalde
is just as likely to bray as a regidor they perceived in short
clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle
with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly
don quixote proceeded to join them not a little to sanchos uneasiness
for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that sort the
members of the troop received him into the midst of them taking him to
be some one who was on their side don quixote putting up his visor
advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with the ass
and all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look at him
staring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing him
for the first time don quixote seeing them examining him so
attentively and that none of them spoke to him or put any question to
him determined to take advantage of their silence so breaking his own
he lifted up his voice and said worthy sirs i entreat you as earnestly
as i can not to interrupt an argument i wish to address to you until you
find it displeases or wearies you and if that come to pass on the
slightest hint you give me i will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon
they all bade him say what he liked for they would listen to him
with this permission don quixote went on to say i sirs am a
knight errant whose calling is that of arms and whose profession is to
protect those who require protection and give help to such as stand in
need of it some days ago i became acquainted with your misfortune and
the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge
yourselves upon your enemies and having many times thought over your
business in my mind i find that according to the laws of combat you
are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted for a private individual
cannot insult an entire community unless it be by defying it
collectively as a traitor because he cannot tell who in particular is
guilty of the treason for which he defies it of this we have an example
in don diego ordonez de lara who defied the whole town of zamora
because he did not know that vellido dolfos alone had committed the
treachery of slaying his king and therefore he defied them all and the
vengeance and the reply concerned all though to be sure senor don
diego went rather too far indeed very much beyond the limits of a
defiance for he had no occasion to defy the dead or the waters or the
fishes or those yet unborn and all the rest of it as set forth but let
that pass for when anger breaks out theres no father governor or
bridle to check the tongue the case being then that no one person can
insult a kingdom province city state or entire community it is clear
there is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an
insult inasmuch as it is not one a fine thing it would be if the people
of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone
who called them by that name or the cazoleros berengeneros
ballenatos jaboneros or the bearers of all the other names and titles
that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people it would be a
nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff
and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their
swords in every petty quarrel no no god forbid there are four things
for which sensible men and well ordered states ought to take up arms
draw their swords and risk their persons lives and properties the
first is to defend the catholic faith the second to defend ones life
which is in accordance with natural and divine law the third in defence
of ones honour family and property the fourth in the service of
ones king in a just war and if to these we choose to add a fifth which
may be included in the second in defence of ones country to these
five as it were capital causes there may be added some others that may
be just and reasonable and make it a duty to take up arms but to take
them up for trifles and things to laugh at and he amused by rather than
offended looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in common
sense moreover to take an unjust revenge and there cannot be any just
one is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge wherein
we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us
a command which though it seems somewhat difficult to obey is only so
to those who have in them less of god than of the world and more of the
flesh than of the spirit for jesus christ god and true man who never
lied and could not and cannot lie said as our law giver that his yoke
was easy and his burden light he would not therefore have laid any
command upon us that it was impossible to obey thus sirs you are bound
to keep quiet by human and divine law
the devil take me said sancho to himself at this but this master of
mine is a tologian or if not faith hes as like one as one egg is
don quixote stopped to take breath and observing that silence was still
preserved had a mind to continue his discourse and would have done so
had not sancho interposed with his smartness for he seeing his master
pause took the lead saying my lord don quixote of la mancha who once
was called the knight of the rueful countenance but now is called the
knight of the lions is a gentleman of great discretion who knows latin
and his mother tongue like a bachelor and in everything that he deals
with or advises proceeds like a good soldier and has all the laws and
ordinances of what they call combat at his fingers ends so you have
nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says and on my
head be it if it is wrong besides which you have been told that it is
folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray i remember when i was a
boy i brayed as often as i had a fancy without anyone hindering me and
so elegantly and naturally that when i brayed all the asses in the town
would bray but i was none the less for that the son of my parents who
were greatly respected and though i was envied because of the gift by
more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town i did not care two
farthings for it and that you may see i am telling the truth wait a bit
and listen for this art like swimming once learnt is never forgotten
and then taking hold of his nose he began to bray so vigorously that
one of those however that stood near him fancying he was mocking them
lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with
it that sancho dropped helpless to the ground don quixote seeing him so
roughly handled attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand but
so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him far
from it finding a shower of stones rained upon him and crossbows and
muskets unnumbered levelled at him he wheeled rocinante round and as
fast as his best gallop could take him fled from the midst of them
commending himself to god with all his heart to deliver him out of this
peril in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming
out at his breast and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it
had gone from him the members of the band however were satisfied with
seeing him take to flight and did not fire on him they put up sancho
scarcely restored to his senses on his ass and let him go after his
master not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast but
dapple followed the footsteps of rocinante from whom he could not remain
a moment separated don quixote having got some way off looked back and
seeing sancho coming waited for him as he perceived that no one
followed him the men of the troop stood their ground till night and as
the enemy did not come out to battle they returned to their town
exulting and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the greeks
they would have erected a trophy on the spot
of matters that benengeli says he who reads them will know if he reads
when the brave man flees treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to
reserve themselves for better occasions this proved to be the case with
don quixote who giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the
hostile intentions of the angry troop took to flight and without a
thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him retreated to
such a distance as he thought made him safe sancho lying across his
ass followed him as has been said and at length came up having by
this time recovered his senses and on joining him let himself drop off
dapple at rocinantes feet sore bruised and belaboured don quixote
dismounted to examine his wounds but finding him whole from head to
foot he said to him angrily enough in an evil hour didst thou take to
braying sancho where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention
the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged to the music of
brays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels give thanks
to god sancho that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick
and did not mark thee per signum crucis with a cutlass
im not equal to answering said sancho for i feel as if i was
speaking through my shoulders let us mount and get away from this ill
keep from braying but not from saying that knights errant fly and leave
their good squires to be pounded like privet or made meal of at the
he does not fly who retires returned don quixote for i would have
thee know sancho that the valour which is not based upon a foundation
of prudence is called rashness and the exploits of the rash man are to
be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage and so i own that i
retired but not that i fled and therein i have followed the example of
many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times the
histories are full of instances of this but as it would not be any good
to thee or pleasure to me i will not recount them to thee now
sancho was by this time mounted with the help of don quixote who then
himself mounted rocinante and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take
shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off
every now and then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans and
on don quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering he replied
that from the end of his back bone up to the nape of his neck he was so
sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses
the cause of that soreness said don quixote will be no doubt that
the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one it caught thee
all down the back where all the parts that are sore are situated and
had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still
by god said sancho your worship has relieved me of a great doubt
and cleared up the point for me in elegant style body o me is the
cause of my soreness such a mystery that theres any need to tell me i am
sore everywhere the staff hit me if it was my ankles that pained me
there might be something in going divining why they did but it is not
much to divine that im sore where they thrashed me by my faith master
mine the ills of others hang by a hair every day i am discovering more
and more how little i have to hope for from keeping company with your
worship for if this time you have allowed me to be drubbed the next
time or a hundred times more well have the blanketings of the other
day over again and all the other pranks which if they have fallen on my
shoulders now will be thrown in my teeth by and by i would do a great
deal better if i was not an ignorant brute that will never do any good
all my life i would do a great deal better i say to go home to my
wife and children and support them and bring them up on what god may
please to give me instead of following your worship along roads that
lead nowhere and paths that are none at all with little to drink and
less to eat and then when it comes to sleeping measure out seven feet
on the earth brother squire and if thats not enough for you take as
many more for you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to
your hearts content oh that i could see burnt and turned to ashes the
first man that meddled with knight errantry or at any rate the first who
chose to be squire to such fools as all the knights errant of past times
must have been of those of the present day i say nothing because as
your worship is one of them i respect them and because i know your
worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and think
i would lay a good wager with you sancho said don quixote that now
that you are talking on without anyone to stop you you dont feel a pain
in your whole body talk away my son say whatever comes into your head
or mouth for so long as you feel no pain the irritation your
impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me and if you are so anxious
to go home to your wife and children god forbid that i should prevent
you you have money of mine see how long it is since we left our village
this third time and how much you can and ought to earn every month and
when i worked for tom carrasco the father of the bachelor samson
carrasco that your worship knows replied sancho i used to earn two
ducats a month besides my food i cant tell what i can earn with your
worship though i know a knight errants squire has harder times of it
than he who works for a farmer for after all we who work for farmers
however much we toil all day at the worst at night we have our olla
supper and sleep in a bed which i have not slept in since i have been in
your worships service if it wasnt the short time we were in don diego
de mirandas house and the feast i had with the skimmings i took off
camachos pots and what i ate drank and slept in basilios house all
the rest of the time i have been sleeping on the hard ground under the
open sky exposed to what they call the inclemencies of heaven keeping
life in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread and drinking water
either from the brooks or from the springs we come to on these by paths
i own sancho said don quixote that all thou sayest is true how
much thinkest thou ought i to give thee over and above what tom
i think said sancho that if your worship was to add on two reals a
month id consider myself well paid that is as far as the wages of my
labour go but to make up to me for your worships pledge and promise to
me to give me the government of an island it would be fair to add six
very good said don quixote it is twenty five days since we left our
village so reckon up sancho according to the wages you have made out
for yourself and see how much i owe you in proportion and pay yourself
as i said before out of your own hand
o body o me said sancho but your worship is very much out in that
reckoning for when it comes to the promise of the island we must count
from the day your worship promised it to me to this present hour we are
well how long is it sancho since i promised it to you said don
if i remember rightly said sancho it must be over twenty years
don quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laugh
heartily and said he why i have not been wandering either in the
sierra morena or in the whole course of our sallies but barely two
months and thou sayest sancho that it is twenty years since i promised
thee the island i believe now thou wouldst have all the money thou hast
of mine go in thy wages if so and if that be thy pleasure i give it to
thee now once and for all and much good may it do thee for so long as
i see myself rid of such a good for nothing squire ill be glad to be
left a pauper without a rap but tell me thou perverter of the squirely
rules of knight errantry where hast thou ever seen or read that any
knight errants squire made terms with his lord you must give me so
much a month for serving you plunge scoundrel rogue monster for
such i take thee to be plunge i say into the mare magnum of their
histories and if thou shalt find that any squire ever said or thought
what thou hast said now i will let thee nail it on my forehead and give
me over and above four sound slaps in the face turn the rein or the
halter of thy dapple and begone home for one single step further thou
shalt not make in my company o bread thanklessly received o promises
ill bestowed o man more beast than human being now when i was about to
raise thee to such a position that in spite of thy wife they would
call thee my lord thou art leaving me thou art going now when i had a
firm and fixed intention of making thee lord of the best island in the
world well as thou thyself hast said before now honey is not for the
mouth of the ass ass thou art ass thou wilt be and ass thou wilt end
when the course of thy life is run for i know it will come to its close
before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast
sancho regarded don quixote earnestly while he was giving him this
rating and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes
and in a piteous and broken voice he said to him master mine i confess
that to be a complete ass all i want is a tail if your worship will
only fix one on to me ill look on it as rightly placed and ill serve
you as an ass all the remaining days of my life forgive me and have pity
on my folly and remember i know but little and if i talk much its
more from infirmity than malice but he who sins and mends commends
i should have been surprised sancho said don quixote if thou hadst
not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech well well i
forgive thee provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future so
fond of thine own interest but try to be of good cheer and take heart
and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my promises
which by being delayed does not become impossible
sancho said he would do so and keep up his heart as best he could they
then entered the grove and don quixote settled himself at the foot of an
elm and sancho at that of a beech for trees of this kind and others
like them always have feet but no hands sancho passed the night in pain
for with the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the
more don quixote passed it in his never failing meditations but for
all that they had some winks of sleep and with the appearance of
daylight they pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous
ebro where that befell them which will be told in the following chapter
of the famous adventure of the enchanted bark
by stages as already described or left undescribed two days after
quitting the grove don quixote and sancho reached the river ebro and the
sight of it was a great delight to don quixote as he contemplated and
gazed upon the charms of its banks the clearness of its stream the
gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters and
the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind above
all he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of montesinos for though
master pedros ape had told him that of those things part was true part
false he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood the very
reverse of sancho who held them all to be downright lies
as they were thus proceeding then they discovered a small boat without
oars or any other gear that lay at the waters edge tied to the stem of
a tree growing on the bank don quixote looked all round and seeing
nobody at once without more ado dismounted from rocinante and bade
sancho get down from dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of
a poplar or willow that stood there sancho asked him the reason of this
sudden dismounting and tying don quixote made answer thou must know
sancho that this bark is plainly and without the possibility of any
alternative calling and inviting me to enter it and in it go to give
aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it who is
no doubt in some sore strait for this is the way of the books of
chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them when a
knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered
save by the hand of another knight though they may be at a distance of
two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other they either
take him up on a cloud or they provide a bark for him to get into and
in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and
where his help is required and so sancho this bark is placed here for
the same purpose this is as true as that it is now day and ere this one
passes tie dapple and rocinante together and then in gods hand be it to
guide us for i would not hold back from embarking though barefooted
as thats the case said sancho and your worship chooses to give in
to these i dont know if i may call them absurdities at every turn
theres nothing for it but to obey and bow the head bearing in mind the
proverb do as thy master bids thee and sit down to table with him
but for all that for the sake of easing my conscience i warn your
worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one but belongs
to some of the fishermen of the river for they catch the best shad in
as sancho said this he tied the beasts leaving them to the care and
protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart don quixote
bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals for he who would
carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take care
i dont understand that logiquous said sancho nor have i ever heard
the word all the days of my life
longinquous replied don quixote means far off but it is no wonder
thou dost not understand it for thou art not bound to know latin like
some who pretend to know it and dont
now they are tied said sancho what are we to do next
what said don quixote cross ourselves and weigh anchor i mean
embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held and the bark
began to drift away slowly from the bank but when sancho saw himself
somewhere about two yards out in the river he began to tremble and give
himself up for lost but nothing distressed him more than hearing dapple
bray and seeing rocinante struggling to get loose and said he to his
master dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him and rocinante is
trying to escape and plunge in after us o dear friends peace be with
you and may this madness that is taking us away from you turned into
sober sense bring us back to you and with this he fell weeping so
bitterly that don quixote said to him sharply and angrily what art
thou afraid of cowardly creature what art thou weeping at heart of
butter paste who pursues or molests thee thou soul of a tame mouse
what dost thou want unsatisfied in the very heart of abundance art
thou perchance tramping barefoot over the riphaean mountains instead
of being seated on a bench like an archduke on the tranquil stream of
this pleasant river from which in a short space we shall come out upon
the broad sea but we must have already emerged and gone seven hundred or
eight hundred leagues and if i had here an astrolabe to take the
altitude of the pole i could tell thee how many we have travelled
though either i know little or we have already crossed or shall shortly
cross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite poles midway
and when we come to that line your worship speaks of said sancho how
very far said don quixote for of the three hundred and sixty degrees
that this terraqueous globe contains as computed by ptolemy the
greatest cosmographer known we shall have travelled one half when we
by god said sancho your worship gives me a nice authority for what
you say putrid dolly something transmogrified or whatever it is
don quixote laughed at the interpretation sancho put upon computed and
