186 the moral sentiment in europe at present is perhaps as subtle
belated diverse sensitive and refined as the science of morals
belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarse fingered an
interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious
in the very person of a moralist indeed the expression science
of morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too
presumptuous and counter to good taste which is always a foretaste of
more modest expressions one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what
is still necessary here for a long time what is alone proper for the
present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey
and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth
and distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perish and
perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common
forms of these living crystallizations as preparation for a theory of
types of morality to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest
all the philosophers with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness
demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and
ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality as a science
they wanted to give a basic to morality and every philosopher hitherto
has believed that he has given it a basis morality itself however has
been regarded as something given how far from their awkward pride
was the seemingly insignificant problem left in dust and decay of a
description of forms of morality notwithstanding that the finest hands
and senses could hardly be fine enough for it it was precisely owing to
moral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitrary
epitome or an accidental abridgement perhaps as the morality of
their environment their position their church their zeitgeist their
climate and zone it was precisely because they were badly instructed
with regard to nations eras and past ages and were by no means eager
to know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of the
real problems of morals problems which only disclose themselves by
a comparison of many kinds of morality in every science of morals
hitherto strange as it may sound the problem of morality itself
has been omitted there has been no suspicion that there was anything
problematic there that which philosophers called giving a basis to
morality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in a right light
proved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality a new
means of its expression consequently just a matter of fact within the
sphere of a definite morality yea in its ultimate motive a sort of
denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question and
in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and
vivisecting of this very faith hear for instance with what
innocence almost worthy of honour schopenhauer represents his own
task and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a
science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and
old wives the principle he says page 136 of the grundprobleme der
ethik footnote pages 54 55 of schopenhauers basis of morality
translated by arthur b bullock ma 1903 the axiom about the
purport of which all moralists are practically agreed neminem laede
immo omnes quantum potes juva is really the proposition which all moral
teachers strive to establish  the real basis of ethics which
has been sought like the philosophers stone for centuries the
difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be
great it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his
efforts and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and
sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is will
to power may be reminded that schopenhauer although a pessimist
actually played the flute daily after dinner one may read about
the matter in his biography a question by the way a pessimist a
repudiator of god and of the world who makes a halt at morality who
assents to morality and plays the flute to laede neminem morals what
187 apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical
imperative in us one can always ask what does such an assertion
indicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which are
meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people other systems
of morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him self satisfied
with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with others
he wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others
to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction this system of
morals helps its author to forget that system makes him or something
of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and
creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kant
especially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable
in me is that i know how to obey and with you it shall not be
otherwise than with me in short systems of morals are only a
188 in contrast to laisser aller every system of morals is a sort of
tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no
objection unless one should again decree by some system of morals that
all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is
essential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is a
long constraint in order to understand stoicism or port royal
or puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every
language has attained to strength and freedom the metrical constraint
the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm how much trouble have the poets and
orators of every nation given themselves not excepting some of
the prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable
conscientiousness for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglers
say and thereby deem themselves wise from submission to arbitrary
laws as the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free even
free spirited the singular fact remains however that everything
of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly
certainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itself
or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just as in
conduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary
law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely
this is nature and natural and not laisser aller every artist
knows how different from the state of letting himself go is his
most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing
and constructing in the moments of inspiration and how strictly and
delicately he then obeys a thousand laws which by their very rigidness
and precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the most
stable idea has in comparison therewith something floating manifold
and ambiguous in it the essential thing in heaven and in earth is
apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obedience
in the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted in
the long run something which has made life worth living for instance
virtue art music dancing reason spirituality anything whatever
that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine the long bondage of
the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of
ideas the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think
in accordance with the rules of a church or a court or conformable
to aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpret
everything that happened according to a christian scheme and in every
occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god all this
has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit has
attained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility
granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be
stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here as everywhere
nature shows herself as she is in all her extravagant and indifferent
magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble that
for centuries european thinkers only thought in order to prove
something nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker
who wishes to prove something that it was always settled beforehand
what was to be the result of their strictest thinking as it was perhaps
in the asiatic astrology of former times or as it is still at the
present day in the innocent christian moral explanation of immediate
personal events for the glory of god or for the good of the
soul this tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent
stupidity has educated the spirit slavery both in the coarser and
the finer sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual
education and discipline one may look at every system of morals in this
light it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser aller
the too great freedom and implants the need for limited horizons for
immediate duties it teaches the narrowing of perspectives and thus in
a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development
thou must obey some one and for a long time otherwise thou wilt come
to grief and lose all respect for thyself this seems to me to be the
moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical
as old kant wished consequently the otherwise nor does it address
itself to the individual what does nature care for the individual
but to nations races ages and ranks above all however to the
189 industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle it was a
master stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to such
an extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his week and
work day again as a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated
fast such as is also frequently found in the ancient world although
as is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respect
to work many kinds of fasts are necessary and wherever powerful
influences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalary
days are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn to
hunger anew viewed from a higher standpoint whole generations and
epochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism
seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting during
which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself at the same time
also to purify and sharpen itself certain philosophical sects likewise
admit of a similar interpretation for instance the stoa in the midst
of hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with
aphrodisiacal odours here also is a hint for the explanation of the
paradox why it was precisely in the most christian period of european
history and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments
that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour passion
190 there is something in the morality of plato which does not really
belong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might
say in spite of him namely socratism for which he himself was
too noble no one desires to injure himself hence all evil is done
unwittingly the evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do
so however if he knew that evil is evil the evil man therefore is
only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily
make him good this mode of reasoning savours of the populace who
perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil doing and practically
judge that it is stupid to do wrong while they accept good as
identical with useful and pleasant without further thought as
regards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it
has the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom err plato
did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the
tenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into them he
the most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire socrates out
of the street as a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless
and impossible modifications namely in all his own disguises and
multiplicities in jest and in homeric language as well what is the
platonic socrates if not greek words inserted here
191 the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more
plainly of instinct and reason the question whether in respect to the
valuation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationality
which wants to appreciate and act according to motives according to
a why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utility it
is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of
socrates and had divided mens minds long before christianity socrates
himself following of course the taste of his talent that of a
surpassing dialectician took first the side of reason and in fact
what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the
noble athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could
never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions
in the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also
at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found
in himself the same difficulty and incapacity but why he said
to himself should one on that account separate oneself from the
instincts one must set them right and the reason also one must follow
the instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support them
with good arguments this was the real falseness of that great and
mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he
was satisfied with a kind of self outwitting in fact he perceived
the irrationality in the moral judgment plato more innocent in such
matters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to
himself at the expenditure of all his strength the greatest strength
a philosopher had ever expended that reason and instinct lead
spontaneously to one goal to the good to god and since plato all
theologians and philosophers have followed the same path which means
that in matters of morality instinct or as christians call it
faith or as i call it the herd has hitherto triumphed unless
one should make an exception in the case of descartes the father of
rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution who
recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and
192 whoever has followed the history of a single science finds in
its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest
processes of all knowledge and cognizance there as here the
premature hypotheses the fictions the good stupid will to belief
and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed our senses
learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and
cautious organs of knowledge our eyes find it easier on a given
occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon
the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more
force more morality it is difficult and painful for the ear to
listen to anything new we hear strange music badly when we hear
another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds
into words with which we are more familiar and conversant it was thus
for example that the germans modified the spoken word arcubalista into
armbrust cross bow our senses are also hostile and averse to the
new and generally even in the simplest processes of sensation the
emotions dominate such as fear love hatred and the passive emotion
of indolence as little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words
not to speak of syllables of a page he rather takes about five out
of every twenty words at random and guesses the probably appropriate
sense to them just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely
in respect to its leaves branches colour and shape we find it so
much easier to fancy the chance of a tree even in the midst of the
most remarkable experiences we still do just the same we fabricate the
greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate
any event except as inventors thereof all this goes to prove
that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have
been accustomed to lying or to express it more politely and
hypocritically in short more pleasantly one is much more of an artist
than one is aware of in an animated conversation i often see the face
of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined
before me according to the thought he expresses or which i believe to
be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the
strength of my visual faculty the delicacy of the play of the muscles
and of the expression of the eyes must therefore be imagined by me
probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all
193 quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise what we
experience in dreams provided we experience it often pertains at
last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything
actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we
have a requirement more or less and finally in broad daylight and
even in the brightest moments of our waking life we are ruled to some
extent by the nature of our dreams supposing that someone has often
flown in his dreams and that at last as soon as he dreams he is
conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his
peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who believes that on the
slightest impulse he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles who
knows the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards
without effort or constraint a downwards without descending
or lowering without trouble how could the man with such
dream experiences and dream habits fail to find happiness differently
coloured and defined even in his waking hours how could he fail to
long differently for happiness flight such as is described by poets
must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular
194 the difference among men does not manifest itself only in the
difference of their lists of desirable things in their regarding
different good things as worth striving for and being disagreed as to
the greater or less value the order of rank of the commonly recognized
desirable things it manifests itself much more in what they regard as
actually having and possessing a desirable thing as regards a woman
for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification
serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the
more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for
possession sees the questionableness the mere apparentness of such
ownership and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially
whether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up for
his sake what she has or would like to have only then does he look upon
her as possessed a third however has not even here got to the limit
of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether
the woman when she gives up everything for him does not perhaps do
so for a phantom of him he wishes first to be thoroughly indeed
profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he ventures to let
himself be found out only then does he feel the beloved one fully in
his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when
she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed
insatiability as for his goodness patience and spirituality one
man would like to possess a nation and he finds all the higher arts of
cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose another with a more
refined thirst for possession says to himself one may not deceive
where one desires to possess he is irritated and impatient at the idea
that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people i must
therefore make myself known and first of all learn to know myself
among helpful and charitable people one almost always finds the awkward
craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped as
though for instance he should merit help seek just their help and
would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them
for all help with these conceits they take control of the needy as a
property just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a
desire for property one finds them jealous when they are crossed or
forestalled in their charity parents involuntarily make something like
themselves out of their children they call that education no mother
doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is
thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to his own
ideas and notions of worth indeed in former times fathers deemed it
right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly
born as among the ancient germans and like the father so also do the
teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new
individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession the
195 the jews a people born for slavery as tacitus and the whole
ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nations as
they themselves say and believe the jews performed the miracle of the
inversion of valuations by means of which life on earth obtained a new
and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums their prophets fused
into one the expressions rich godless wicked violent
sensual and for the first time coined the word world as a term of
reproach in this inversion of valuations in which is also included
the use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend the
significance of the jewish people is to be found it is with them that
196 it is to be inferred that there are countless dark bodies near the
sun such as we shall never see among ourselves this is an allegory
and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star writing merely as an
allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed
197 the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance caesar borgia
are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long as
one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of
all tropical monsters and growths or even an innate hell in them as
almost all moralists have done hitherto does it not seem that there is
a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists and
that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs whether
as disease and deterioration of mankind or as his own hell and
self torture and why in favour of the temperate zones in favour
of the temperate men the moral the mediocre this for the chapter
198 all the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to
their happiness as it is called what else are they but suggestions
for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which
the individuals live recipes for their passions their good and bad
propensities insofar as such have the will to power and would like
to play the master small and great expediencies and elaborations
permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old wife
wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their form because
they address themselves to all because they generalize where
generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally
and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely
with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even
seductive when they are over spiced and begin to smell dangerously
especially of the other world that is all of little value when
estimated intellectually and is far from being science much less
wisdom but repeated once more and three times repeated it is
stupidity whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness
towards the heated folly of the emotions which the stoics advised and
fostered or the no more laughing and no more weeping of spinoza the
destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection which he
recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent
mean at which they may be satisfied the aristotelianism of morals
or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary
attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps as
music or as love of god and of mankind for gods sake for in religion
the passions are once more enfranchised provided that or finally
even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions as has
been taught by hafis and goethe the bold letting go of the reins the
spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of
wise old codgers and drunkards with whom it no longer has much
danger this also for the chapter morals as timidity
199 inasmuch as in all ages as long as mankind has existed there have
also been human herds family alliances communities tribes peoples
states churches and always a great number who obey in proportion
to the small number who command in view therefore of the fact that
obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto
one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is
now innate in every one as a kind of formal conscience which gives
the command thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally
refrain from something in short thou shalt this need tries to
satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content according to its
strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes as an omnivorous
appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into
its ear by all sorts of commanders parents teachers laws class
prejudices or public opinion the extraordinary limitation of human
turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herd instinct of
obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command if
one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commanders
and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether or they
will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose
a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to
command just as if they also were only obeying this condition of things
actually exists in europe at present i call it the moral hypocrisy of
the commanding class they know no other way of protecting themselves
from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older
and higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice of
the law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maxims
from the current opinions of the herd as first servants of their
people or instruments of the public weal on the other hand the
gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only
kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his qualities such as
indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and
useful to the herd as the peculiarly human virtues in cases however
where it is believed that the leader and bell wether cannot be dispensed
with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders
by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative
constitutions for example are of this origin in spite of all what a
blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the
appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans of this
fact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great proof
the history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history of
the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its
200 the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with
one another who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his
body that is to say contrary and often not only contrary instincts
and standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldom
at peace such a man of late culture and broken lights will on an
average be a weak man his fundamental desire is that the war which is
in him should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character
of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance epicurean
or christian it is above all things the happiness of repose of
undisturbedness of repletion of final unity it is the sabbath of
sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician st augustine
who was himself such a man should however the contrariety and
conflict in such natures operate as an additional incentive and stimulus
to life and if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and
irreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinated
into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict
with themselves that is to say the faculty of self control and
self deception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and
inexplicable beings those enigmatical men predestined for conquering
and circumventing others the finest examples of which are alcibiades
and caesar with whom i should like to associate the first of europeans
according to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second and
among artists perhaps leonardo da vinci they appear precisely in the
same periods when that weaker type with its longing for repose comes
to the front the two types are complementary to each other and spring
201 as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only
gregarious utility as long as the preservation of the community is only
kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in
what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be
no morality of love to ones neighbour granted even that there is
already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness
gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition
of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly
distinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almost
coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not
as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations they are still
ultra moral a sympathetic action for instance is neither called good
nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the romans and should
it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this
praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared
with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the res
publica after all love to our neighbour is always a secondary
matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to
our fear of our neighbour after the fabric of society seems on the
whole established and secured against external dangers it is this
fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral
valuation certain strong and dangerous instincts such as the love of
love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the
point of view of general utility under other names of course than
those here given but had to be fostered and cultivated because they
were perpetually required in the common danger against the common
enemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong when
the outlets for them are lacking and are gradually branded as immoral
and given over to calumny the contrary instincts and inclinations now
attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws its
conclusions how much or how little dangerousness to the community or
to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a
disposition or an endowment that is now the moral perspective here
again fear is the mother of morals it is by the loftiest and strongest
instincts when they break out passionately and carry the individual
far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious
conscience that the self reliance of the community is destroyed its
belief in itself its backbone as it were breaks consequently these
very instincts will be most branded and defamed the lofty independent
spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are
felt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above the
herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called
evil the tolerant unassuming self adapting self equalizing
disposition the mediocrity of desires attains to moral distinction and
honour finally under very peaceful circumstances there is always
less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity
and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begins
to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and
self responsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb
and still more the sheep wins respect there is a point of diseased
mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society
itself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the criminal
and does so in fact seriously and honestly to punish appears to it
to be somehow unfair it is certain that the idea of punishment and
the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people is
it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we
still punish punishment itself is terrible with these questions
gregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimate
conclusion if one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear
one would have done away with this morality at the same time it
would no longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longer
necessary whoever examines the conscience of the present day european
will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds
and hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish
that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time
or other the will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress all
202 let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred
times for peoples ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths our
truths we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one
plainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it will
be accounted to us almost a crime that it is precisely in respect to
men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd
herd instincts and such like expressions what avail is it we cannot
do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is we
have found that in all the principal moral judgments europe has become
unanimous including likewise the countries where european influence
prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he
did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to
teach they know today what is good and evil it must then sound hard
and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which
here thinks it knows that which here glorifies itself with praise
and blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding human
animal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more
to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts
according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance
of which it is the symptom morality in europe at present is
herding animal morality and therefore as we understand the matter
only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after
which many other moralities and above all higher moralities are or
should be possible against such a possibility against such a should
be however this morality defends itself with all its strength it
says obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else
is morality indeed with the help of a religion which has humoured
and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding animal things have
reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of
this morality even in political and social arrangements the democratic
movement is the inheritance of the christian movement that its tempo
however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones for
those who are sick and distracted by the herding instinct is indicated
by the increasingly furious howling and always less disguised
teeth gnashing of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through the
highways of european culture apparently in opposition to the peacefully
industrious democrats and revolution ideologues and still more so
to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity visionaries who call
themselves socialists and want a free society those are really at one
with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form
of society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even of
repudiating the notions master and servant ni dieu ni maitre says
a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every
special claim every special right and privilege this means ultimately
opposition to every right for when all are equal no one needs rights
any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though it
were a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequences of
all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy
in their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to the
very animals up even to god the extravagance of sympathy for
god belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and
impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering
generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or
allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart softening
under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new
buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy as
though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of
mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present
the great discharge from all the obligations of the past altogether at
one in their belief in the community as the deliverer in the herd and
203 we who hold a different belief we who regard the democratic
movement not only as a degenerating form of political organization but
as equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man as involving his
mediocrising and depreciation where have we to fix our hopes in
new philosophers there is no other alternative in minds strong and
original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value to transvalue
and invert eternal valuations in forerunners in men of the future
who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which
will compel millenniums to take new paths to teach man the future
of humanity as his will as depending on human will and to make
preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in
rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful
rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of
history the folly of the greatest number is only its last
form for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will
some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that
has existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent beings might
look pale and dwarfed the image of such leaders hovers before our
eyes is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits the
conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for
their genesis the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which
a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a
constraint to these tasks a transvaluation of values under the new
pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart
transformed into brass so as to bear the weight of such responsibility
and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders the dreadful
danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degenerate these
are our real anxieties and glooms ye know it well ye free spirits
these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the
heaven of our life there are few pains so grievous as to have seen
divined or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and
deteriorated but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger
of man himself deteriorating he who like us has recognized the
extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in
respect to the future of mankind a game in which neither the hand nor
even a finger of god has participated he who divines the fate that
is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of
modern ideas and still more under the whole of christo european
morality suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared
