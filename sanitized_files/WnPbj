a charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a boy of
half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the command
was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted
rostov riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars with
clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the
mud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
trees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had gone
tattered blue purple clouds reddening in the east were scudding
before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass
which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still
wet with the nights rain the drooping branches of the birches also
wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostov
always closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the road
when campaigning rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a
regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he
had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horse
dun colored with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one could
outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought
of the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of the
formerly when going into action rostov had felt afraid now he had not
the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grown
used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because
he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown
accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would
seem most likely to interest him the impending danger during the first
period of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproached
himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time
it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch trees
occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes
touching his horses side with his foot or without turning round
handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with as
calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride he
glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and in
great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds
the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and
all was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared
behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later it
reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing its
edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and as
if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of them
before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of
that firing count ostermann tolstoys adjutant came galloping from
vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road
the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which had
also quickened their pace rode down a hill and passing through an
empty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to lather
halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was
heard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from in
and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of
our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to
the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve
higher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible through
the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning
sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the enemys
columns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard
briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale
at these sounds long unheard rostovs spirits rose as at the strains
of the merriest music trap ta ta tap cracked the shots now together
now several quickly one after another again all was silent and then
again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonade
began count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron
halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill to
after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans
the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry
to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering
and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to
as soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up
the hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by the
uhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fell
the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more
pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds
of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out
before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement
of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something
confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later our
uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more
to the left and among the orange colored uhlans on chestnut horses and
behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could
rostov with his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catch
sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and
nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons
pursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so small
at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving their
rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt
instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now the
latter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it must
be done now at that very moment or it would be too late he looked
around a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself with
andrew sevastyanych said rostov you know we could crush them
a fine thing too replied the captain and really
rostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped to
the front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving the
word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was following
him rostov himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he
did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons
near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not
withstand an attack knew there was only that moment and that if he let
it slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so
stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
not restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of command
and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his
deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons
hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
instinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as they
drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after
them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the
foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same
feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostov
gave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on foot
flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless
horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were
galloping back rostov picking out one on a gray horse dashed after
him on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and
almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would
immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by his
uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horse
and urging it on with his saber in another moment rostovs horse dashed
its breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almost
knocking it over and at the same instant rostov without knowing why
raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it
the instant he had done this all rostovs animation vanished the
officer fell not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut his
arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from fright
rostov reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on
the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed up
with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at
rostov with shrinking terror his pale and mud stained face fair and
young with a dimple in the chin and light blue eyes was not an enemys
face at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face
before rostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried i
surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from rostovs face
some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was
wounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his
horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him
a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front the
french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily
back with their prisoners rostov galloped back with the rest aware of
an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague and
confused which he could not at all account for had come over him with
the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him
count ostermann tolstoy met the returning hussars sent for rostov
thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor
and would recommend him for a st georges cross when sent for by count
ostermann rostov remembering that he had charged without orders felt
sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of
discipline ostermanns flattering words and promise of a reward should
therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt
that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on
earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the
general ilyin no hes safe have i disgraced myself in any way no
thats not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes
oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my arm
rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting in
his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound he
glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting
rostov still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame
all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostov
without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he
drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something
rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to
his amazement had gained him the st georges cross and even given him a
reputation for bravery and there was something he could not at all
understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so
thats all there is in what is called heroism and did i do it for my
countrys sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyes
and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should
i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st georges
cross i cant make it out at all
but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach
no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the
service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at
ostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar
battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen
on receiving news of natashas illness the countess though not quite
well yet and still weak went to moscow with petya and the rest of the
household and the whole family moved from marya dmitrievnas house to
natashas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for her
parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her
conduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into the
background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat or
sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made them
feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help
her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in
french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great
variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple
idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
natasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can be
known for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has
his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to
medicine not a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so
on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the
innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simple
thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard
that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their
lives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best
years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was
kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really
useful as in fact they were to the whole rostov family their
usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for
the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were
given in small doses but they were useful necessary and
indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of
those who loved her and that is why there are and always will be
pseudo healers wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied
that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that
something should be done which is felt by those who are suffering they
satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when it
wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itself
and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
spot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the child
cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no
remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its
mothers sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were
of use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her
that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemists in
the arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble
and seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water at
intervals of precisely two hours neither more nor less
what would sonya and the count and countess have done how would they
have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills
to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the
other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which
supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would
the count have borne his dearly loved daughters illness had he not
known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not
grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if her
illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take
her abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain
the details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptoms
but frise had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would the
countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
youll never get well like that she would say forgetting her grief
in her vexation if you wont obey the doctor and take your medicine at
the right time you mustnt trifle with it you know or it may turn to
pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of
that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself
what would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she had
not undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready to
carry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that she
still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered
even to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices
were being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicine
at certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure her
and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to
show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical
the doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and
regardless of her grief stricken face joked with her but when he had
gone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him he
assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and
the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him
slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient
the symptoms of natashas illness were that she ate little slept
little coughed and was always low spirited the doctors said that she
could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in the
stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to the
in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of
such things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived of
the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed natashas
grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased
to press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the past
natasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external
forms of pleasure balls promenades concerts and theaters but she
never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could not
sing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tears
choked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those pure
times which could never return tears of vexation that she should so
uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy
laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy in
face of her sorrow without any need of self restraint no wish to
coquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that time that no man
was more to her than nastasya ivanovna the buffoon something stood
sentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost all
the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of
hope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmas
holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest
and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even a
single day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at
the time had not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness
for any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to live
it comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
imagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world but
this was not enough she knew that and asked herself what next but
there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life was
passing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
anyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in
the house and felt at ease only with her brother petya she liked to be
with him better than with the others and when alone with him she
sometimes laughed she hardly ever left the house and of those who came
to see them was glad to see only one person pierre it would have been
impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at the
same time more seriously than did count bezukhov natasha unconsciously
felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but she
was not even grateful to him for it nothing good on pierres part
seemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind
to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness sometimes natasha
noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence
especially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared that
something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her she
noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness
which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her
after those involuntary words that if he were free he would have asked
on his knees for her hand and her love uttered at a moment when she was
so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of his feelings and
it seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comforted
her were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
a crying child it was not because pierre was a married man but because
natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
which she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered her head
that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
part still less on his or even to the kind of tender self conscious
romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
before the end of the fast of st peter agrafena ivanovna belova a
country neighbor of the rostovs came to moscow to pay her devotions at
the shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natasha should fast
and prepare for holy communion and natasha gladly welcomed the idea
despite the doctors orders that she should not go out early in the
morning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament
not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attending
three services in their own house but as agrafena ivanovna did by
going to church every day for a week and not once missing vespers
the countess was pleased with natashas zeal after the poor results of
the medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer
might help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fear
and concealing it from the doctor she agreed to natashas wish and
entrusted her to belova agrafena ivanovna used to come to wake natasha
at three in the morning but generally found her already awake she was
afraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting on
her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natasha shivering in the fresh
air went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn
by agrafena ivanovnas advice natasha prepared herself not in their own
parish but at a church where according to the devout agrafena
ivanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there were
never many people in the church natasha always stood beside belova in
the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into the
screen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her of
humility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when at
that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the virgin
illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light
falling from the window she listened to the words of the service which
she tried to follow with understanding when she understood them her
personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its
own when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that the
wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to
understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
oneself to god whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments she
crossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horror
at her own vileness simply asked god to forgive her everything
everything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrendered
herself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at an
early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men
sweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleep
natasha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility of
correcting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and of
during the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew every
day and the happiness of taking communion or communing as agrafena
ivanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to natasha
so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday
but the happy day came and on that memorable sunday when dressed in
white muslin she returned home after communion for the first time for
many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
the doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he
evidently sincerely satisfied with his success only please be
be quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the gold
coin in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about the
last medicine has done her a very great deal of good she has freshened
the countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at her
nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room
at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war
began to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to
the people and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as up
to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received
exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was
in danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon had
an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia
on the eleventh of july which was saturday the manifesto was received
but was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostovs promised
to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifesto
and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchin
that sunday the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis private chapel
as usual it was a hot july day even at ten oclock when the rostovs
got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts of
hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leaves
of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the white
trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels on
the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that
summer languor that content and discontent with the present which is
most strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscow
notabilities all the rostovs acquaintances were at the razumovskis
chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families
who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that
summer as natasha at her mothers side passed through the crowd
behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard a
young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper
shes much thinner but all the same shes pretty
she heard or thought she heard the names of kuragin and bolkonski but
she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone who
looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with a
sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in
a crowd natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked
as women can walk with the more repose and stateliness the greater the
pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was pretty
but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on the contrary
it tormented her more than anything else of late and particularly so on
this bright hot summer day in town its sunday again another week
past she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday before
and always the same life that is no life and the same surroundings in
which it used to be so easy to live im pretty im young and i know
that now i am good i used to be bad but now i know i am good she
thought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to
anyone she stood by her mothers side and exchanged nods with
acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies dresses
condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing
herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought with
vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others and
suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her own
vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
a comely fresh looking old man was conducting the service with that
mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
souls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed
the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voice
pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did not
understand made natashas breast heave and a joyous but oppressive
teach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow good
the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and
holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and
solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer
in peace let us pray unto the lord
as one community without distinction of class without enmity united
by brotherly love let us pray thought natasha
for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls
for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed
when they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and
denisov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she
remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive her
all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love us
she prayed for the members of her own family her father and mother and
sonya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
them and feeling all the strength of her love for them when they
prayed for those who hate us she tried to think of her enemies and
people who hated her in order to pray for them she included among her
enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father
and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
remembered anatole who had done her so much harm and though he did not
hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did
she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole
as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
devotion to god when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod
she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross saying to herself
that even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and at
any rate loved the governing synod and prayed for it
when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over his
breast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ
commit ourselves to god natasha inwardly repeated lord god i
submit myself to thy will she thought i want nothing wish for
nothing teach me what to do and how to use my will take me take me
prayed natasha with impatient emotion in her heart not crossing
herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself
from her regrets desires remorse hopes and sins
the countess looked round several times at her daughters softened face
and shining eyes and prayed god to help her
unexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual order
natasha knew so well the deacon brought out a small stool the one he
knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before the doors
of the sanctuary screen the priest came out with his purple velvet
biretta on his head adjusted his hair and knelt down with an effort
everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in
surprise then came the prayer just received from the synod a prayer
for the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion
lord god of might god of our salvation began the priest in that
voice clear not grandiloquent but mild in which only the slav clergy
read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart
lord god of might god of our salvation look this day in mercy and
blessing on thy humble people and graciously hear us spare us and
have mercy upon us this foe confounding thy land desiring to lay waste
the whole world rises against us these lawless men are gathered
together to overthrow thy kingdom to destroy thy dear jerusalem thy
beloved russia to defile thy temples to overthrow thine altars and to
desecrate our holy shrines how long o lord how long shall the wicked
triumph how long shall they wield unlawful power
lord god hear us when we pray to thee strengthen with thy might our
most gracious sovereign lord the emperor alexander pavlovich be
mindful of his uprightness and meekness reward him according to his
righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless his
counsels his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom by
thine almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as thou
gavest moses the victory over amalek gideon over midian and david over
goliath preserve his army put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
have armed themselves in thy name and gird their loins with strength
for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise to help us
confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us may
they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the
wind and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight may
they be ensnared when they know it not and may the plots they have laid
in secret be turned against them let them fall before thy servants
feet and be laid low by our hosts lord thou art able to save both
great and small thou art god and man cannot prevail against thee
god of our fathers remember thy bounteous mercy and loving kindness
which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious to our
unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not
our transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew
a right spirit within us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our
hope inspire us with true love one for another arm us with unity of
spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to
our fathers and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against
o lord our god in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us
not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy
blessing that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and
be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art
the lord and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord
and grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice
in thy mercy smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
the feet of thy faithful servants for thou art the defense the succor
and the victory of them that put their trust in thee and to thee be all
glory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world without
in natashas receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over
amalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the
destruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with the
tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but without
fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she
shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness
for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animation
by love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under
foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of
them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the
righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees she
felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own
sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to
give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her
from the day when pierre after leaving the rostovs with natashas
grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to
be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
horizon from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented
itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him
amid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a
reply to the former question but by her image when he listened to or
himself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard of
human baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did not
ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
transient and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last
seen her and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered the
questions that had haunted him but because his conception of her
transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual
activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a realm of beauty
and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness
presented itself to him he said to himself
well supposing n n swindled the country and the tsar and the
country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she
smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her and
no one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful
pierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle and
dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostovs
there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits and
acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along
irresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports came
from the seat of war and natashas health began to improve and she no
longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an ever
increasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession of
him he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that
a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and he
impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe
one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy
concerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st john
in chapter 13 verse 18 of the apocalypse it is said
here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the
beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred
and in the fifth verse of the same chapter
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
the french alphabet written out with the same numerical values as the
hebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the others
a b c d e f g h i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 l m n o p q r s 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
90 t u v w x y 100 110 120 130 140 150 z 160
writing the words lempereur napoleon in numbers it appears that the
sum of them is 666 and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
in the apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the words
quarante deux  which was the term allowed to the beast that spoke
great things and blasphemies the same number 666 was obtained from
which it followed that the limit fixed for napoleons power had come in
the year 1812 when the french emperor was forty two this prophecy
pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
end to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tried by the
same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find an
answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words lempereur
alexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums were
either more or less than 666 once when making such calculations he
wrote down his own name in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sum
of the numbers did not come right then he changed the spelling
substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le still
without obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if the
answer to the question were contained in his name his nationality would
also be given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up
the numbers got 671 this was only five too much and five was
represented by e the very letter elided from the article le before the
word empereur by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre got the
answer he sought lrusse besuhof made 666 this discovery excited him
how or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in
the apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for
a moment his love for natasha antichrist napoleon the invasion the
comet 666 lempereur napoleon and lrusse besuhof all this had to
mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere
of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre had
promised the rostovs to bring them from count rostopchin whom he knew
well both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in the
morning when he went to call at rostopchins he met there a courier
fresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at
do please for heavens sake relieve me of something said the
courier i have a sackful of letters to parents
among these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father pierre
took that letter and rostopchin also gave him the emperors appeal to
moscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his own
most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found in
one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name of
nicholas rostov awarded a st georges cross of the fourth class for
courage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the same order the name of
prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment of
chasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostovs of bolkonski
pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their
sons having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order
and nicholas letter to the rostovs keeping the appeal the bulletin
and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner
his conversation with count rostopchin and the latters tone of anxious
hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in
moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to
be in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of the
emperors being expected to arrive next day all aroused with fresh
force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had
been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially
he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so
had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of
freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual
peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he
saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking
patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief
reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
vague idea that he was lrusse besuhof who had the number of the beast
666 that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power
of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake
anything but wait for what was bound to come to pass
a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day as usual
pierre came early so as to find them alone
he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his
he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman did
not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was at
the rostovs he stayed till midnight the rostovs footman rushed
eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and
stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in the
the first person he saw in the house was natasha even before he saw
her while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfa
exercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since her
illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he
opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn at
church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when he
opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised
face she blushed and came rapidly up to him
i want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuse
how glad i am youve come i am so happy today she said with the old
animation pierre had not seen in her for a long time you know nicholas
has received a st georges cross i am so proud of him
oh yes i sent that announcement but i dont want to interrupt you
he added and was about to go to the drawing room
count is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her
no why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask me
i dont know myself natasha answered quickly but i should not like
to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely you
dont know how important you are to me how much youve done for me
she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words i
saw in that same army order that he bolkonski she whispered the name
hastily is in russia and in the army again what do you think she
was speaking hurriedly evidently afraid her strength might fail her
will he ever forgive me will he not always have a bitter feeling
toward me what do you think what do you think
i think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive if i
by association of ideas pierre was at once carried back to the day
when trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself but
the best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for her
hand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possession
of him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give him
yes you you she said uttering the word you rapturously
thats a different thing i know no one kinder more generous or
better than you nobody could be had you not been there then and now
too i dont know what would have become of me because
tears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her music
before her eyes began singing again and again began walking up and
just then petya came running in from the drawing room
petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
resembled natasha he was preparing to enter the university but he and
his friend obolenski had lately in secret agreed to join the hussars
petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair he
had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the
pierre walked up and down the drawing room not listening to what petya
petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention
well what about my plan peter kirilych for heavens sake you are my
oh yes your plan to join the hussars ill mention it ill bring it
well mon cher have you got the manifesto asked the old count the
countess has been to mass at the razumovskis and heard the new prayer
yes ive got it said pierre the emperor is to be here tomorrow
theres to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility and they are
talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me congratulate
yes yes thank god well and what news from the army
we are again retreating they say were already near smolensk replied
o lord o lord exclaimed the count where is the manifesto
pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers but could not find
them still slapping his pockets he kissed the hand of the countess who
entered the room and glanced uneasily around evidently expecting
natasha who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing
on my word i dont know what ive done with it he said
there he is always losing everything remarked the countess
natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat
down looking silently at pierre as soon as she entered pierres
features which had been gloomy suddenly lighted up and while still
searching for the papers he glanced at her several times
no really ill drive home i must have left them there ill
but sonya who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom had
found them in pierres hat where he had carefully tucked them under the
no after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much
at dinner at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
chevalier of st george shinshin told them the town news of the
illness of the old georgian princess of metiviers disappearance from
moscow and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin and
accused of being a french spyer so count rostopchin had told the
story and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was
not a spire at all but only an old german ruin
people are being arrested said the count ive told the countess
she should not speak french so much its not the time for it now
and have you heard shinshin asked prince golitsyn has engaged a
master to teach him russian it is becoming dangerous to speak french in
and how about you count peter kirilych if they call up the militia
you too will have to mount a horse remarked the old count addressing
pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner seeming not
to grasp what was said he looked at the count
oh yes the war he said no what sort of warrior should i make and
yet everything is so strange so strange i cant make it out i dont
know i am very far from having military tastes but in these times no
after dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
