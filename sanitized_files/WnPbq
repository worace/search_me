that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who
described the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon and
napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
air and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously
and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course
of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a suggestion
from davout who was now called prince deckmuhl to turn the russian
left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why
not to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack the
fleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon agreed though
the so called duke of elchingen ney ventured to remark that a movement
through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division
having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt napoleon
pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian
entrenchments and the places where in line with them the field
after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and the
dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation
these dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasm
and other historians with profound respect were as follows
at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain
occupied by the prince deckmuhl will open fire on the opposing
at the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st corps
general pernetti with thirty cannon of campans division and all the
howitzers of dessaixs and friants divisions will move forward open
fire and overwhelm with shellfire the enemys battery against which
24 guns of the artillery of the guards 30 guns of campans division
and 8 guns of friants and dessaixs divisions
the commander of the artillery of the 3rd corps general fouche will
place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th corps sixteen in all on the
flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left
which will have forty guns in all directed against it
general sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
howitzers of the guards artillery against either one or other of the
during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood
on the village and turn the enemys position
general campan will move through the wood to seize the first
after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given in
the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the
right wing are heard the sharpshooters of morands division and of the
vice kings division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack
the vice king will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges
advancing to the same heights as morands and gibrards divisions which
under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et
methode as far as possible retaining troops in reserve
these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows
oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius
related to napoleons orders to deal with four points four different
orders not one of these was or could be carried out
in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
spot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche which
were to come in line with them 102 guns in all were to open fire and
shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts this could not be
done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not
carry to the russian works and those 102 guns shot into the air until
the nearest commander contrary to napoleons instructions moved them
the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the
wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and was
not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the
wood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn
the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize
the first fortification general campans division did not seize the
first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wood
it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware
the fourth order was the vice king will occupy the village borodino
and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as
morands and gibrards divisions for whose movements no directions are
given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
and come into line with the rest of the forces
as far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible
sentence as from the attempts the vice king made to execute the orders
given him he was to advance from the left through borodino to the
redoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance
all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could not
be executed after passing through borodino the vice king was driven
back to the kolocha and could get no farther while the divisions of
morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the
redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing
probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of the
orders in the disposition was or could be executed but in the
disposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in this
manner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movements
and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
made by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be
done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that as
appeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not one
of his orders during the fight could be executed
many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodino
because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the
orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world
have been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by
the will of one man peter the great and that france from a republic
became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one
man napoleon to say that russia remained a power because napoleon had
a bad cold on the twenty fourth of august may seem logical and
if it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the
battle of borodino and if this or that other arrangement depended on
his will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
might have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty fourth would have been the
savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction is
indubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest
without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacre
of st bartholomew was due to charles ixs stomach being deranged but
to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man
peter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia
begun by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merely
untrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to the
question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself
namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on high
depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the
events and that a napoleons influence on the course of these events is
strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of
st bartholomew was not due to charles ixs will though he gave the
order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order and
strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
men at borodino was not due to napoleons will though he ordered the
commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because
he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignity
which tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less a man
than the great napoleon demands the acceptance of that solution of the
at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one
that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed
the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino
not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the whole
army french italian german polish and dutch hungry ragged and
weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then
forbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him and
have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable
when they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensation
for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been
in the battle before moscow they cried vive lempereur just as they
had cried vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boy
piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would
have cried vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told them
there was nothing left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and go
to fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it
was not because of napoleons commands that they killed their fellow
and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none
of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one
another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently of
him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took
place by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold
has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
moreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the
cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former
occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
previously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons cold on
the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better
than previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudo
orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the
same as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than
previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did
not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem
very bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of
importance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and the
very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people
fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a
the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were
a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were
criticized criticized for their very perfection for their excessive
napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as
representative of authority as well as and even better than at other
battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he
inclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not
contradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field of
battle but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity
on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked
the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow
having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to him
about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress
household surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
he showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love of
travel and chatted carelessly as a famous self confident surgeon who
knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron
while a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter is
in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the time comes to
set to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest and
the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you
ought to be and the more amazed at my genius
having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before
the serious business which he considered awaited him next day he was
so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in
spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
evening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock in
the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians had
not withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in the
the adjutant in attendance came into the tent
well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon
do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolensk
continued rapp the wine is drawn and must be drunk
napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since
smolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so
and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards
napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watch
he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible
to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had
all been given and were now being executed
have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
rapp replied that he had given the emperors order about the rice but
napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his
order had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleon
ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped his
i have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass
this cold is tiresome they talk about medicine what is the good of
medicine when it cant cure a cold corvisart gave me these lozenges but
they dont help at all what can doctors cure one cant cure anything
our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it is its
nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself it
will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies
our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time the
watchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that
blindfold yes our body is just a machine for living that is all
and having entered on the path of definition of which he was fond
napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one
do you know rapp what military art is asked he it is the art of
being stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats all
tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we shall
see do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and
did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments we shall
he looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not feel
sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do he
rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went out
of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible
moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly
burning among the french guards and in the distance those of the
russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and the
rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take
napoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires and
listened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a
shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped
what year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of
military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice
at half past five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino
it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay in
the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report
shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another
napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he
on returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered
his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning
and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner boris
before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left
the hut the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was
your excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating
pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at
him having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up
what has it begun is it time pierre asked waking up
hear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all the
gentlemen have gone out and his serene highness himself rode past long
pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was bright
fresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting forth from behind a
cloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken by
the clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dew
besprinkled dust of the road on the walls of the houses on the
windows the fence and on pierres horses standing before the hut the
roar of guns sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by a
its time count its time cried the adjutant
telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down the
street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
day before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of the
staff could be heard conversing in french and kutuzovs gray head in a
white cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his
shoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before
mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him
spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from that
spot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops and
covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of the
bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it
through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden tinted
light and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of the
panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish green
color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
was pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops
nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses
there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right and
left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed
pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodino
and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha
above the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially to
the left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the
kolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to
become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
and outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist
and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water from
the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
riverbanks and in borodino a white church could be seen through the
mist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense
masses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and all
this moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over the
whole space just as in the mist enveloped hollow near borodino so
along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods
and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the high
ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of
nothing now singly now several at a time some translucent others
dense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended over
these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of the firing
puff suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from
violet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a second
puff puff and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
together and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had
pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a round
compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating
to one side and puff with a pause puff puff three and then
four more appeared and then from each with the same interval boom
boom boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as
if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while
woods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the left
over fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually
appearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the
hollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had
no time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the same
way trakh ta ta takh came the frequent crackle of musketry but it
was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon
pierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that
movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and his suite
to compare his impressions with those of others they were all looking
at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the
same feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth
of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood
go my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutuzov was saying
to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from the
having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down
to the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one
of the staff who asked where he was going
ill go there too i too thought pierre and followed the general
the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to
his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest
clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes
pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles
were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins he
galloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as they
having descended the hill the general after whom pierre was galloping
turned sharply to the left and pierre losing sight of him galloped in
among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to pass
either in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldiers
everywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some
unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the same
dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat
who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horses
why ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at him
another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and pierre
bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse
galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space
there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firing
pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to the
bridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino which the french
having occupied borodino were attacking in the first phase of the
battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow
among the rows of new mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
smoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firing
going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he did
not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or the
projectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other side
of the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded
though many fell near him he looked about him with a smile which did
whys that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him again
to the left keep to the right the men shouted to him
pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of raevskis
adjutants whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently
also intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he nodded
how have you got here he said and galloped on
pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of
getting in someones way again galloped after the adjutant
whats happening here may i come with you he asked
one moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stout
colonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message and
why have you come here count he asked with a smile still
but the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on
here its tolerable said he but with bagration on the left flank
come along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and in
our battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you come
yes ill come with you replied pierre looking round for his groom
it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being
carried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day
before a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with his
head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off
why havent they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeing
the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way he
pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
adjutant to raevskis redoubt his horse lagged behind the adjutants
you dont seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutant
no its not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in a
why shes wounded said the adjutant in the off foreleg above the
knee a bullet no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism of
having ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillery
which had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with the
noise of firing they came to a small wood there it was cool and quiet
with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up
is the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll
he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told him
the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now
dont trouble about me said pierre ill go up onto the knoll if i
yes do youll see everything from there and its less dangerous and
pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meet
again and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that
the knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
to the russians as the knoll battery or raevskis redoubt and to the
french as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centre
around which tens of thousands fell and which the french regarded as
this redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches had
been dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
in line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired
incessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry when ascending
that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trenches
had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the most
on the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it one
of the least significant parts of the field
having reached the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trench
surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about the
battery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers
who were loading hauling the guns and continually running past him
with bags and charges the guns of that battery were being fired
continually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping the
in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support
here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were
separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common and
the intrusion of pierres nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an
unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him with
surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artillery
officer a tall long legged pockmarked man moved over to pierre as if
to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity
a young round faced officer quite a boy still and evidently only just
out of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two guns
sir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you must not be
the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre
but when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
with a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up and
down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard
their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
kindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogs
cocks goats and in general for the animals that live with the
regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted him
gave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun of him among
a shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around
with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up
and hows it youre not afraid sir really now a red faced broad
shouldered soldier asked pierre with a grin that disclosed a set of
what else do you expect answered the soldier she has no mercy you
know when she comes spluttering down out go your innards one cant
several of the men with bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre
they seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and the
its the business of us soldiers but in a gentleman its wonderful
to your places cried the young officer to the men gathered round
the young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or
second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with
the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
intense over the whole field especially to the left where bagrations
fleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole attention
was engrossed by watching the family circle separated from all else
formed by the men in the battery his first unconscious feeling of
joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
was now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldier
lying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench he
by ten oclock some twenty men had already been carried away from the
battery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around
but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voices
a live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approached
not this way to the infantry added another with loud laughter
seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports
are you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing a peasant
who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over
several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench looking out to see
theyve withdrawn the front line it has retired said they pointing
mind your own business an old sergeant shouted at them if theyve
retired its because theres work for them to do farther back
and the sergeant taking one of the men by the shoulders gave him a
shove with his knee this was followed by a burst of laughter
to the fifth gun wheel it up came shouts from one side
now then all together like bargees rose the merry voices of those
oh she nearly knocked our gentlemans hat off cried the red faced
humorist showing his teeth chaffing pierre awkward baggage he added
reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a mans
now then you foxes said another laughing at some militiamen who
stooping low entered the battery to carry away the wounded man
so this gruel isnt to your taste oh you crows youre scared they
shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
there lads oh oh they mimicked the peasants they dont like it
pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt and after
every loss the liveliness increased more and more
as the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and
rapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition to
what was taking place the lightning of hidden fire growing more and
more intense glowed in the faces of these men
pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know
what was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire
which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the
at ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of
the battery and along the kamenka streamlet retreated from the battery
they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their
muskets a general with his suite came to the battery and after
speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away again
having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down so
as to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks of
infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts
of command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry
pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by
a pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walking
the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long
drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few
minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher bearers came back from
that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
battery several men were lying about who had not been removed around
the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily no one any
longer took notice of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for being
in the way the senior officer moved with big rapid strides from one
gun to another with a frowning face the young officer with his face
still more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than ever the
soldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their business
with strained smartness they gave little jumps as they walked as
the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire which
pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the
commanding officer the young officer his hand to his shako ran up to
i have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are left are
grapeshot the senior shouted without answering the question looking
suddenly something happened the young officer gave a gasp and bending
double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing everything
became strange confused and misty in pierres eyes
one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a
soldier or a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before now
heard nothing else on the right of the battery soldiers shouting
hurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre
a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
standing crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyes
and at the same instant plumped into something some militiamen who were
the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
some wine asked for that there were no more charges
the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning to
the officers face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under
run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yelled
angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men
the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side
the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
eh sir this is no place for you said he and ran down the slope
pierre ran after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was
one cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in front
beside and behind him pierre ran down the slope where am i going
he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition
wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go on
suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at the
same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately a
deafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tingle
when he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his
hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed
only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and a
horse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past while
another horse lay like pierre on the ground uttering prolonged and
beside himself with terror pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery
as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him
on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
there but that no shots were being fired from the battery he had no
time to realize who these men were he saw the senior officer lying on
the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something
down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was
struggling forward shouting brothers and trying to free himself from
some men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something else
but he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed that
the soldier shouting brothers was a prisoner and that another man
had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he run
into the redoubt before a thin sallow faced perspiring man in a blue
uniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something instinctively
guarding against the shock for they had been running together at full
speed before they saw one another pierre put out his hands and seized
the man a french officer by the shoulder with one hand and by the
throat with the other the officer dropping his sword seized pierre by
for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothers
unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what
they were to do next am i taken prisoner or have i taken him
prisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently more
inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because pierres strong
hand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever tighter and
tighter the frenchman was about to say something when just above their
heads terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierre
that the french officers head had been torn off so swiftly had he
pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall without further thought
as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to the battery
and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who
it seemed to him caught at his feet but before he reached the foot of
the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of russian soldiers who
stumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward the
battery this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the credit
declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible
it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some st georges
crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to
the french who had occupied the battery fled and our troops shouting
hurrah pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult
the prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a
wounded french general whom the officers surrounded crowds of wounded
some known to pierre and some unknown russians and french with faces
distorted by suffering walked crawled and were carried on stretchers
from the battery pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent
over an hour and of that family circle which had received him as a
member he did not find a single one there were many dead whom he did
not know but some he recognized the young officer still sat in the
same way bent double in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall
the red faced man was still twitching but they did not carry him away
now they will stop it now they will be horrified at what they have
done he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
but behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high and in front and
especially to the left near semenovsk something seemed to be seething
in the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish but
even increased to desperation like a man who straining himself shrieks
the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seven
thousand feet between borodino and bagrations fleches beyond that
space there was on the one side a demonstration made by the russians
with uvarovs cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond utitsa
poniatowskis collision with tuchkov but these two were detached and
feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the
battlefield on the field between borodino and the fleches beside the
wood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way
the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
then when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisions
campans and dessaixs advanced from the french right while murats
from the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the fleches were
two thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
to borodino so that napoleon could not see what was happening there
especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality
the soldiers of dessaixs division advancing against the fleches could
only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
the fleches as soon as they had descended into that hollow the smoke
of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered
the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses could
be caught of something black probably men and at times the glint of
bayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they were
french or russian could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt
the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
napoleons face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at the
