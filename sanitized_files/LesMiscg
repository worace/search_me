in fertility with the detritus of a capital a great city is the most
mighty of dung makers certain success would attend the experiment
of employing the city to manure the plain if our gold is manure our
what is done with this golden manure it is swept into the abyss
fleets of vessels are despatched at great expense to collect the dung
of petrels and penguins at the south pole and the incalculable element
of opulence which we have on hand we send to the sea all the human and
animal manure which the world wastes restored to the land instead of
being cast into the water would suffice to nourish the world
those heaps of filth at the gate posts those tumbrils of mud which
jolt through the street by night those terrible casks of the street
department those fetid drippings of subterranean mire which the
pavements hide from you do you know what they are they are the meadow
in flower the green grass wild thyme thyme and sage they are game
they are cattle they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the
evening they are perfumed hay they are golden wheat they are the
bread on your table they are the warm blood in your veins they are
health they are joy they are life this is the will of that mysterious
creation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven
restore this to the great crucible your abundance will flow forth from
it the nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men
you have it in your power to lose this wealth and to consider me
ridiculous to boot this will form the master piece of your ignorance
statisticians have calculated that france alone makes a deposit of
half a milliard every year in the atlantic through the mouths of her
rivers note this with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter
of the expenses of our budget the cleverness of man is such that he
prefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter it is
the very substance of the people that is carried off here drop by
drop there wave after wave the wretched outpour of our sewers into the
rivers and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean every
hiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs from this spring two
results the land impoverished and the water tainted hunger arising
from the furrow and disease from the stream
it is notorious for example that at the present hour the thames is
so far as paris is concerned it has become indispensable of late to
transport the mouths of the sewers down stream below the last bridge
a double tubular apparatus provided with valves and sluices sucking up
and driving back a system of elementary drainage simple as the lungs
of a man and which is already in full working order in many communities
in england would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into
our cities and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities
and this easy exchange the simplest in the world would retain among us
the five hundred millions now thrown away people are thinking of other
the process actually in use does evil with the intention of doing good
the intention is good the result is melancholy thinking to purge the
city the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars a sewer
is a mistake when drainage everywhere with its double function
restoring what it takes shall have replaced the sewer which is a
simple impoverishing washing then this being combined with the data
of a now social economy the product of the earth will be increased
tenfold and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened add the
suppression of parasitism and it will be solved
in the meanwhile the public wealth flows away to the river and leakage
takes place leakage is the word europe is being ruined in this manner
as for france we have just cited its figures now paris contains one
twenty fifth of the total population of france and parisian guano being
the richest of all we understate the truth when we value the loss on
the part of paris at twenty five millions in the half milliard which
france annually rejects these twenty five millions employed in
assistance and enjoyment would double the splendor of paris the
city spends them in sewers so that we may say that pariss great
prodigality its wonderful festival its beaujon folly its orgy its
stream of gold from full hands its pomp its luxury its magnificence
it is in this manner that in the blindness of a poor political economy
we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the
well being of all there should be nets at saint cloud for the public
economically considered the matter can be summed up thus paris is
a spendthrift paris that model city that patron of well arranged
capitals of which every nation strives to possess a copy that
metropolis of the ideal that august country of the initiative of
impulse and of effort that centre and that dwelling of minds that
nation city that hive of the future that marvellous combination of
babylon and corinth would make a peasant of the fo kian shrug his
shoulders from the point of view which we have just indicated
moreover and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste paris
these surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel this is no
young folly the ancients did like the moderns the sewers of rome
says liebig have absorbed all the well being of the roman peasant
when the campagna of rome was ruined by the roman sewer rome exhausted
italy and when she had put italy in her sewer she poured in sicily
then sardinia then africa the sewer of rome has engulfed the world
this cess pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe urbi
rome sets the example for these things as well as for others
paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to
for the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have
just explained our views paris has beneath it another paris a paris
of sewers which has its streets its cross roads its squares its
blind alleys its arteries and its circulation which is of mire and
for nothing must be flattered not even a great people where there
is everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity and
if paris contains athens the city of light tyre the city of might
sparta the city of virtue nineveh the city of marvels it also
however the stamp of its power is there also and the titanic sink of
paris realizes among monuments that strange ideal realized in humanity
by some men like macchiavelli bacon and mirabeau grandiose vileness
the sub soil of paris if the eye could penetrate its surface would
present the aspect of a colossal madrepore a sponge has no more
partitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six
leagues round about on which rests the great and ancient city not to
mention its catacombs which are a separate cellar not to mention
the inextricable trellis work of gas pipes without reckoning the vast
tubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the
pillar fountains the sewers alone form a tremendous shadowy net work
under the two banks a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding
there appears in the humid mist the rat which seems the product to
let the reader imagine paris lifted off like a cover the subterranean
net work of sewers from a birds eye view will outline on the banks
a species of large branch grafted on the river on the right bank the
belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch the secondary ducts will
form the branches and those without exit the twigs
this figure is but a summary one and half exact the right angle which
is the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications
a more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed
by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet
as intricate as a thicket against a background of shadows and the
misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion
and as at haphazard now by their angles again by their extremities
sinks and sewers played a great part in the middle ages in the lower
empire and in the orient of old the masses regarded these beds of
decomposition these monstrous cradles of death with a fear that was
almost religious the vermin ditch of benares is no less conducive to
giddiness than the lions ditch of babylon teglath phalasar according
to the rabbinical books swore by the sink of nineveh it was from the
sewer of munster that john of leyden produced his false moon and it
was from the cess pool of kekscheb that oriental menalchme mokanna the
veiled prophet of khorassan caused his false sun to emerge
the history of men is reflected in the history of sewers the
germoniae58 narrated rome the sewer of paris has been an ancient and
formidable thing it has been a sepulchre it has served as an asylum
crime intelligence social protest liberty of conscience thought
theft all that human laws persecute or have persecuted is hidden in
that hole the maillotins in the fourteenth century the tire laine of
the fifteenth the huguenots in the sixteenth morins illuminated in
the seventeenth the chauffeurs brigands in the eighteenth a
hundred years ago the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence the
pickpocket in danger slipped thither the forest had its cave paris had
its sewer vagrancy that gallic picareria accepted the sewer as the
adjunct of the cour des miracles and at evening it returned thither
fierce and sly through the maubuee outlet as into a bed chamber
it was quite natural that those who had the blind alley vide gousset
empty pocket or the rue coupe gorge cut throat for the scene of
their daily labor should have for their domicile by night the culvert
of the chemin vert or the catch basin of hurepoix hence a throng of
souvenirs all sorts of phantoms haunt these long solitary
corridors everywhere is putrescence and miasma here and there are
breathing holes where villon within converses with rabelais without
the sewer in ancient paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and
of all attempts political economy therein spies a detritus social
the sewer is the conscience of the city everything there converges
and confronts everything else in that livid spot there are shades but
there are no longer any secrets each thing bears its true form or at
least its definitive form the mass of filth has this in its favor
that it is not a liar ingenuousness has taken refuge there the mask
of basil is to be found there but one beholds its cardboard and its
strings and the inside as well as the outside and it is accentuated
by honest mud scapins false nose is its next door neighbor all the
uncleannesses of civilization once past their use fall into this
trench of truth where the immense social sliding ends they are
there engulfed but they display themselves there this mixture is a
confession there no more false appearances no plastering over is
possible filth removes its shirt absolute denudation puts to the rout
all illusions and mirages there is nothing more except what really
exists presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end
there the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness a basket handle
tells a tale of domesticity there the core of an apple which has
entertained literary opinions becomes an apple core once more the
effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris caiphas
spittle meets falstaffs puking the louis dor which comes from
the gaming house jostles the nail whence hangs the ropes end of the
suicide a livid foetus rolls along enveloped in the spangles which
danced at the opera last shrove tuesday a cap which has pronounced
judgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerly
margotons petticoat it is more than fraternization it is equivalent
to addressing each other as thou all which was formerly rouged is
washed free the last veil is torn away a sewer is a cynic it tells
the sincerity of foulness pleases us and rests the soul when one has
passed ones time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airs
which reasons of state the oath political sagacity human justice
professional probity the austerities of situation incorruptible robes
all assume it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire which
this is instructive at the same time we have just said that history
passes through the sewer the saint barthelemys filter through there
drop by drop between the paving stones great public assassinations
political and religious butcheries traverse this underground passage
of civilization and thrust their corpses there for the eye of the
thinker all historic murderers are to be found there in that hideous
penumbra on their knees with a scrap of their winding sheet for
an apron dismally sponging out their work louis xi is there with
tristan francois i with duprat charles ix is there with his mother
richelieu is there with louis xiii louvois is there letellier is
there hebert and maillard are there scratching the stones and trying
to make the traces of their actions disappear beneath these vaults one
hears the brooms of spectres one there breathes the enormous fetidness
of social catastrophes one beholds reddish reflections in the corners
there flows a terrible stream in which bloody hands have been washed
the social observer should enter these shadows they form a part of
his laboratory philosophy is the microscope of the thought everything
desires to flee from it but nothing escapes it tergiversation is
useless what side of oneself does one display in evasions the shameful
side philosophy pursues with its glance probes the evil and does
not permit it to escape into nothingness in the obliteration of things
which disappear in the watching of things which vanish it recognizes
all it reconstructs the purple from the rag and the woman from the
scrap of her dress from the cess pool it re constitutes the city from
mud it reconstructs manners from the potsherd it infers the amphora
or the jug by the imprint of a finger nail on a piece of parchment it
recognizes the difference which separates the jewry of the judengasse
from the jewry of the ghetto it re discovers in what remains that
which has been good evil the true the blood stain of the palace
the ink blot of the cavern the drop of sweat from the brothel trials
undergone temptations welcomed orgies cast forth the turn which
characters have taken as they became abased the trace of prostitution
in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable and on the
vesture of the porters of rome the mark of messalinas elbowing
the sewer of paris in the middle ages was legendary in the sixteenth
century henri ii attempted a bore which failed not a hundred years
ago the cess pool mercier attests the fact was abandoned to itself
such was this ancient paris delivered over to quarrels to indecision
and to gropings it was tolerably stupid for a long time later on 89
showed how understanding comes to cities but in the good old times
the capital had not much head it did not know how to manage its own
affairs either morally or materially and could not sweep out filth
any better than it could abuses everything presented an obstacle
everything raised a question the sewer for example was refractory to
every itinerary one could no more find ones bearings in the sewer
than one could understand ones position in the city above the
unintelligible below the inextricable beneath the confusion of tongues
there reigned the confusion of caverns daedalus backed up babel
sometimes the paris sewer took a notion to overflow as though this
misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage there
occurred infamous to relate inundations of the sewer at times that
stomach of civilization digested badly the cess pool flowed back into
the throat of the city and paris got an after taste of her own filth
these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they
were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant
at the audacity of its mire and did not admit that the filth should
the inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of parisians of
the age of eighty the mud spread in cross form over the place des
victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv it entered the rue
saint honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the champs elysees
the rue saint florentin through the saint florentin sewer the rue
pierre a poisson through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue popincourt
through the sewer of the chemin vert the rue de la roquette through
the sewer of the rue de lappe it covered the drain of the rue des
champs elysees to the height of thirty five centimetres and to the
south through the vent of the seine performing its functions in
inverse sense it penetrated the rue mazarine the rue de lechaude and
the rue des marais where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and
nine metres a few paces distant from the house in which racine had
lived respecting in the seventeenth century the poet more than the
king it attained its maximum depth in the rue saint pierre where
it rose to the height of three feet above the flag stones of the
water spout and its maximum length in the rue saint sabin where it
spread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty eight metres in length
at the beginning of this century the sewer of paris was still a
mysterious place mud can never enjoy a good fame but in this case its
evil renown reached the verge of the terrible paris knew in a confused
way that she had under her a terrible cavern people talked of it as
of that monstrous bed of thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long
feet in length and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub
the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain
well known points we were then very near the epoch when the scavengers
carts from the summit of which sainte foix fraternized with the marquis
de crequi discharged their loads directly into the sewer as for
cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which
encumbered rather than swept away rome left some poetry to her sewer
and called it the gemoniae paris insulted hers and entitled it the
polypus hole science and superstition were in accord in horror the
polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend the goblin
was developed under the fetid covering of the mouffetard sewer the
corpses of the marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la barillerie
fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great
hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until 1833 in
the rue saint louis almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger
the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mortellerie was celebrated for
the pestilences which had their source there with its grating of iron
with points simulating a row of teeth it was like a dragons maw
in that fatal street breathing forth hell upon men the popular
imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably
hideous intermixture of the infinite the sewer had no bottom the sewer
was the lower world the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not
even occur to the police to try that unknown thing to cast the plummet
into that shadow to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss who
would have dared it was alarming nevertheless some one did present
himself the cess pool had its christopher columbus
one day in 1805 during one of the rare apparitions which the emperor
made in paris the minister of the interior some decres or cretet or
other came to the masters intimate levee in the carrousel there was
audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of
the great republic and of the great empire then napoleons door was
blocked with heroes men from the rhine from the escaut from the
adige and from the nile companions of joubert of desaix of marceau
of hoche of kleber the aerostiers of fleurus the grenadiers of
mayence the pontoon builders of genoa hussars whom the pyramids had
looked down upon artillerists whom junots cannon ball had spattered
with mud cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor
in the zuyderzee some had followed bonaparte upon the bridge of lodi
others had accompanied murat in the trenches of mantua others had
preceded lannes in the hollow road of montebello the whole army of that
day was present there in the court yard of the tuileries represented
by a squadron or a platoon and guarding napoleon in repose and that
was the splendid epoch when the grand army had marengo behind it and
austerlitz before it sire said the minister of the interior to
napoleon yesterday i saw the most intrepid man in your empire what
man is that said the emperor brusquely and what has he done he
wants to do something sire what is it to visit the sewers of
this man existed and his name was bruneseau
the visit took place it was a formidable campaign a nocturnal battle
against pestilence and suffocation it was at the same time a voyage
of discovery one of the survivors of this expedition an intelligent
workingman who was very young at the time related curious details with
regard to it several years ago which bruneseau thought himself obliged
to omit in his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of official
style the processes of disinfection were at that epoch extremely
rudimentary hardly had bruneseau crossed the first articulations of
that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused
to go any further the operation was complicated the visit entailed the
necessity of cleaning hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same
time to proceed to note the entrances of water to count the gratings
and the vents to lay out in detail the branches to indicate the
currents at the point where they parted to define the respective bounds
of the divers basins to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal
sewer to measure the height under the key stone of each drain and the
width at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom in order
to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each
water entrance either of the bottom of the arch or on the soil of the
street they advanced with toil the lanterns pined away in the foul
atmosphere from time to time a fainting sewerman was carried out
at certain points there were precipices the soil had given away the
pavement had crumbled the sewer had changed into a bottomless well
they found nothing solid a man disappeared suddenly they had great
difficulty in getting him out again on the advice of fourcroy they
lighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin from time to time
in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected in some places the
wall was covered with misshapen fungi one would have said tumors the
very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere
bruneseau in his exploration proceeded down hill at the point of
separation of the two water conduits of the grand hurleur he deciphered
upon a projecting stone the date of 1550 this stone indicated the
limits where philibert delorme charged by henri ii with visiting the
subterranean drains of paris had halted this stone was the mark of
the sixteenth century on the sewer bruneseau found the handiwork of
the seventeenth century once more in the ponceau drain of the old rue
vielle du temple vaulted between 1600 and 1650 and the handiwork of
the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal walled
and vaulted in 1740 these two vaults especially the less ancient that
of 1740 were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt
sewer which dated from 1412 an epoch when the brook of fresh water of
menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the grand sewer of paris an
advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet
de chambre to the king something like gros jean transformed into lebel
here and there particularly beneath the court house they thought they
recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons excavated in the very sewer
itself hideous place an iron neck collar was hanging in one of these
cells they walled them all up some of their finds were singular among
others the skeleton of an ourang outan who had disappeared from the
jardin des plantes in 1800 a disappearance probably connected with
the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the rue des
bernardins in the last year of the eighteenth century the poor devil
had ended by drowning himself in the sewer
beneath this long arched drain which terminated at the arche marion
a perfectly preserved rag pickers basket excited the admiration of all
connoisseurs everywhere the mire which the sewermen came to handle
with intrepidity abounded in precious objects jewels of gold and
silver precious stones coins if a giant had filtered this cesspool
he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair at the point
where the two branches of the rue du temple and of the rue sainte avoye
separate they picked up a singular huguenot medal in copper bearing on
one side the pig hooded with a cardinals hat and on the other a wolf
the most surprising encounter was at the entrance to the grand sewer
this entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but
the hinges remained from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless
rag which arrested there in its passage no doubt had floated there
in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart bruneseau
held his lantern close to this rag and examined it it was of very fine
batiste and in one of the corners less frayed than the rest they
made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters
lavbesp the crown was the coronet of a marquis and the seven letters
signified laubespine they recognized the fact that what they had
before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of marat marat in his
youth had had amorous intrigues this was when he was a member of the
household of the comte dartois in the capacity of physician to the
stables from these love affairs historically proved with a great
lady he had retained this sheet as a waif or a souvenir at his death
as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house
they buried him in it some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in
that swaddling band in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed
voluptuousness bruneseau passed on they left that rag where it hung
they did not put the finishing touch to it did this arise from scorn
or from respect marat deserved both and then destiny was there
sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it besides the
things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select in
short the relic was a strange one a marquise had slept in it marat
had rotted in it it had traversed the pantheon to end with the rats
of the sewer this chamber rag of which watteau would formerly have
joyfully sketched every fold had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed
the whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of paris lasted
seven years from 1805 to 1812 as he proceeded bruneseau drew
directed and completed considerable works in 1808 he lowered the arch
of the ponceau and everywhere creating new lines he pushed the
sewer in 1809 under the rue saint denis as far as the fountain of
the innocents in 1810 under the rue froidmanteau and under the
salpetriere in 1811 under the rue neuve des petits peres under the rue
du mail under the rue de lecharpe under the place royale in 1812
under the rue de la paix and under the chaussee dantin at the same
time he had the whole net work disinfected and rendered healthful in
the second year of his work bruneseau engaged the assistance of his
it was thus that at the beginning of the century ancient society
cleansed its double bottom and performed the toilet of its sewer there
tortuous cracked unpaved full of fissures intersected by gullies
jolted by eccentric elbows mounting and descending illogically fetid
wild fierce submerged in obscurity with cicatrices on its pavements
and scars on its walls terrible such was retrospectively viewed the
antique sewer of paris ramifications in every direction crossings
of trenches branches goose feet stars as in military mines coecum
blind alleys vaults lined with saltpetre pestiferous pools scabby
sweats on the walls drops dripping from the ceilings darkness
nothing could equal the horror of this old waste crypt the digestive
apparatus of babylon a cavern ditch gulf pierced with streets a
titanic mole burrow where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind
mole the past prowling through the shadows in the filth which has
this we repeat was the sewer of the past
to day the sewer is clean cold straight correct it almost realizes
the ideal of what is understood in england by the word respectable it
is proper and grayish laid out by rule and line one might almost say
as though it came out of a bandbox it resembles a tradesman who has
become a councillor of state one can almost see distinctly there the
mire there comports itself with decency at first one might readily
mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors which were so common
in former days and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes in
those good old times when the people loved their kings the present
sewer is a beautiful sewer the pure style reigns there the classical
rectilinear alexandrine which driven out of poetry appears to have
taken refuge in architecture seems mingled with all the stones of
that long dark and whitish vault each outlet is an arcade the rue de
rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer however if the geometrical
line is in place anywhere it is certainly in the drainage trench of
a great city there everything should be subordinated to the shortest
road the sewer has nowadays assumed a certain official aspect the
very police reports of which it sometimes forms the subject no longer
are wanting in respect towards it the words which characterize it in
administrative language are sonorous and dignified what used to be
called a gut is now called a gallery what used to be called a hole is
now called a surveying orifice villon would no longer meet with his
ancient temporary provisional lodging this net work of cellars has its
immemorial population of prowlers rodents swarming in greater numbers
than ever from time to time an aged and veteran rat risks his head at
the window of the sewer and surveys the parisians but even these vermin
grow tame so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace the
cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity the rain
which in former days soiled the sewer now washes it nevertheless do
not trust yourself too much to it miasmas still inhabit it it is
more hypocritical than irreproachable the prefecture of police and
the commission of health have done their best but in spite of all the
processes of disinfection it exhales a vague suspicious odor like
let us confess that taking it all in all this sweeping is a homage
which the sewer pays to civilization and as from this point of view
tartuffes conscience is a progress over the augean stables it is
certain that the sewers of paris have been improved
it is more than progress it is transmutation between the ancient
and the present sewer there is a revolution what has effected this
the man whom all the world forgets and whom we have mentioned
the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task the last
ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a
termination any more than they have been able to finish paris the
sewer in fact receives all the counter shocks of the growth of paris
within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a
thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above every
time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm the
old monarchy had constructed only twenty three thousand three hundred
metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the
first of january 1806 beginning with this epoch of which we shall
shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and
prosecuted napoleon built the figures are curious four thousand eight
hundred and four metres louis xviii five thousand seven hundred
and nine charles x ten thousand eight hundred and thirty six
louis philippe eighty nine thousand and twenty the republic of
1848 twenty three thousand three hundred and eighty one the present
government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time
two hundred and twenty six thousand six hundred and ten metres
sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris an obscure
ramification ever at work a construction which is immense and ignored
as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is to day
more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century it is
difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which
have been required to bring this cess pool to the point of relative
perfection in which it now is it was with great difficulty that the
ancient monarchical provostship and during the last ten years of
the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in
perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806
all sorts of obstacles hindered this operation some peculiar to the
soil others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population
of paris paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to
the pick the hoe the bore and to human manipulation there is nothing
more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation
upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called
paris as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures
upon this stretch of alluvium subterranean resistances abound there
are liquid clays springs hard rocks and those soft and deep quagmires
which special science calls moutardes59 the pick advances laboriously
through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of
clay and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster shells the
contemporaries of the pre adamite oceans sometimes a rivulet suddenly
bursts through a vault that has been begun and inundates the laborers
or a layer of marl is laid bare and rolls down with the fury of a
cataract breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass quite
recently at villette when it became necessary to pass the collecting
sewer under the saint martin canal without interrupting navigation or
emptying the canal a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal water
suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel which was beyond
the power of the pumping engines it was necessary to send a diver to
explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the
grand basin and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped
up elsewhere near the seine and even at a considerable distance
from the river as for instance at belleville grand rue and lumiere
passage quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast and in
which a man sinks visibly add suffocation by miasmas burial by slides
and sudden crumbling of the earth add the typhus with which the
workmen become slowly impregnated in our own day after having
excavated the gallery of clichy with a banquette to receive the
principal water conduit of ourcq a piece of work which was executed in
a trench ten metres deep after having in the midst of land slides and
with the aid of excavations often putrid and of shoring up vaulted
the bievre from the boulevard de lhopital as far as the seine after
having in order to deliver paris from the floods of montmartre and in
order to provide an outlet for that river like pool nine hectares in
extent which crouched near the barriere des martyrs after having let
us state constructed the line of sewers from the barriere blanche to
the road of aubervilliers in four months working day and night at a
depth of eleven metres after having a thing heretofore unseen made a
subterranean sewer in the rue barre du bec without a trench six
metres below the surface the superintendent monnot died after having
vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city from
the rue traversiere saint antoine to the rue de lourcine after having
freed the carrefour censier mouffetard from inundations of rain by means
of the branch of the arbalete after having built the saint georges
sewer on rock and concrete in the fluid sands after having directed
the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the
notre dame de nazareth branch duleau the engineer died there are no
bulletins for such acts of bravery as these which are more useful
nevertheless than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle
the sewers of paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to day
bruneseau had given the impulse but the cholera was required to
bring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on it is
surprising to say for example that in 1821 a part of the belt sewer
called the grand canal as in venice still stood stagnating uncovered
to the sky in the rue des gourdes it was only in 1821 that the city
of paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty thousand eighty
francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth the
three absorbing wells of the combat the cunette and saint mande with
their discharging mouths their apparatus their cesspools and their
depuratory branches only date from 1836 the intestinal sewer of paris
has been made over anew and as we have said it has been extended more
than tenfold within the last quarter of a century
thirty years ago at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of
june it was still in many localities nearly the same ancient sewer
a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken
causeways at the end of a slope where the tributaries of a street or
cross roads ended there were often to be seen large square gratings
with heavy bars whose iron polished by the footsteps of the throng
gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles and caused horses to fall
the official language of the roads and bridges gave to these gratings
in 1832 in a number of streets in the rue de letoile the rue
saint louis the rue du temple the rue vielle dutemple the rue
notre dame de nazareth the rue folie mericourt the quai aux fleurs
the rue du petit muse the rue du normandie the rue pont aux biches
the rue des marais the faubourg saint martin the rue notre dame
des victoires the faubourg montmartre the rue grange bateliere in the
champs elysees the rue jacob the rue de tournon the ancient gothic
sewer still cynically displayed its maw it consisted of enormous
voids of stone catch basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts with
paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in
1663 five thousand three hundred fathoms after bruneseau on the 1st
of january 1832 it had forty thousand three hundred metres between
1806 and 1831 there had been built on an average seven hundred and
fifty metres annually afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of
galleries were constructed every year in masonry of small stones with
hydraulic mortar which hardens under water on a cement foundation at
two hundred francs the metre the sixty leagues of paris sewers of the
in addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the
beginning grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that
paris is the centre of two sheets a sheet of water and a sheet of air
the sheet of water lying at a tolerably great depth underground but
already sounded by two bores is furnished by the layer of green clay
situated between the chalk and the jurassic lime stone this layer may
be represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference a
multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there one drinks the seine the
marne the yonne the oise the aisne the cher the vienne and the
loire in a glass of water from the well of grenelle the sheet of water
is healthy it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the
earth the sheet of air is unhealthy it comes from the sewer all the
miasms of the cess pool are mingled with the breath of the city hence
this bad breath the air taken from above a dung heap as has been
scientifically proved is purer than the air taken from above paris in
a given time with the aid of progress mechanisms become perfected and
as light increases the sheet of water will be employed to purify the
sheet of air that is to say to wash the sewer the reader knows that
by washing the sewer we mean the restitution of the filth to the
earth the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields
through this simple act the entire social community will experience a
diminution of misery and an augmentation of health at the present hour
the radiation of diseases from paris extends to fifty leagues around the
louvre taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel
we might say that for ten centuries the cess pool has been the disease
of paris the sewer is the blemish which paris has in her blood the
popular instinct has never been deceived in it the occupation of
sewermen was formerly almost as perilous and almost as repugnant to the
people as the occupation of knacker which was so long held in horror
and handed over to the executioner high wages were necessary to induce
a mason to disappear in that fetid mine the ladder of the cess pool
cleaner hesitated to plunge into it it was said in proverbial form
to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave and all sorts of
hideous legends as we have said covered this colossal sink with
terror a dread sink hole which bears the traces of the revolutions
of the globe as of the revolutions of man and where are to be found
vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the deluge to the rag of
it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself
still another resemblance between paris and the sea as in the ocean
the transition was an unheard of one in the very heart of the city
jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye
in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed
from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from
tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of
the tomb and by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of
the rue polonceau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute
an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret trap door
of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that
sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant he
remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied
the waste trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him celestial
goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery adorable
only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know
whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a
his first sensation was one of blindness all of a sudden he could see
nothing it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf
he no longer heard anything the frantic storm of murder which had been
let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to the
thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said
otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the
depths he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all
but that was enough he extended one arm and then the other touched
the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he
slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet he cautiously put
forward one foot fearing a hole a sink some gulf he discovered that
the paving continued a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in
after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blind a little light
fell through the man hole through which he had descended and his eyes
became accustomed to this cavern he began to distinguish something the
passage in which he had burrowed no other word can better express the
situation was walled in behind him it was one of those blind alleys
which the special jargon terms branches in front of him there was
another wall a wall like night the light of the air hole died out ten
or twelve paces from the point where jean valjean stood and barely cast
a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer beyond
the opaqueness was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an
entrance into it appeared like an engulfment a man could however
plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do haste was
even requisite it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he
had caught sight of under the flag stones might also catch the eye of
the soldiery and that everything hung upon this chance they also might
descend into that well and search it there was not a minute to be lost
he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is
the real word for it placed him on his shoulders once more and set
the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied perils
of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance after
the lightning charged whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasmas and
traps after chaos the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circle
when he had advanced fifty paces he was obliged to halt a problem
presented itself the passage terminated in another gut which he
encountered across his path there two ways presented themselves which
should he take ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he
to find his bearings in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which
we have already called the readers attention has a clue which is its
slope to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river
he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that
if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would
arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine
between the pont au change and the pont neuf that is to say he would
make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot
in paris perhaps he would come out on some man hole at the intersection
of streets amazement of the passers by at beholding two bleeding men
emerge from the earth at their feet arrival of the police a call to
arms of the neighboring post of guards thus they would be seized before
they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth
to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence
he ascended the incline and turned to the right
when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an
air hole disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more
and he became blind again nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as
possible marius two arms were passed round his neck and the formers
feet dragged behind him he held both these arms with one hand and
groped along the wall with the other marius cheek touched his and
clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius
trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes but a
humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched
indicated respiration and consequently life the passage along which
jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean
valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the rain of the
preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little
torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall
in order not to have his feet in the water
thus he proceeded in the gloom he resembled the beings of the night
groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow
still little by little whether it was that the distant air holes
emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his
eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned
to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall
which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing the
pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends
it was not easy to direct his course
the line of the sewer re echoes so to speak the line of the streets
which lie above it there were then in paris two thousand two hundred
streets let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy
branches which is called the sewer the system of sewers existing at
that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven
leagues we have said above that the actual net work thanks to the
special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty
jean valjean began by committing a blunder he thought that he was
beneath the rue saint denis and it was a pity that it was not so under
the rue saint denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis
xiii and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand
sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the
ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the saint martin sewer
whose four arms describe a cross but the gut of the petite truanderie
the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe wine shop has
never communicated with the sewer of the rue saint denis it ended
at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was
entangled there opportunities of losing oneself abound the montmartre
sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network
fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets
whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of
parrots roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more
than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner for
they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation
point first on his left the vast sewer of the platriere a sort of
chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of ts and zs
under the post office and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far
as the seine where it terminates in a y secondly on his right the
curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which
are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the
mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of fork and
proceeding from zig zag to zig zag until it ends in the grand crypt of
the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and
lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeuneurs without
counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer
which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be
had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he
would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was
not in the subterranean gallery of the rue saint denis instead of the
ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal
even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and
mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under
his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone
filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred
francs the metre and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits
materiaux small stuff but of all this he knew nothing
he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing
nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence
by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him the gloom
which enveloped him penetrated his spirit he walked in an enigma this
aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows jean
valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing
it in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last how
was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time
would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow
itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some
unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable
and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of
hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two
skeletons in a nook of that night he did not know he put all these
questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris
form a precipice like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster
all at once he had a surprise at the most unforeseen moment and
without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he
was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against
his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now
descending why was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine this
danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater
it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding the ridge which
the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water sheds
into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this
ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very
capricious line the culminating point which is the point of
separation of the currents is in the sainte avoye sewer beyond the rue
michelle comte in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and
in the montmartre sewer near the halles it was this culminating point
that jean valjean had reached he was directing his course towards the
belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it
every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if
he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the
passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route
rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind
alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say
the outlet thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in
the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated
at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath
the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had
suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and
normal paris overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant
but continuous it was the rumbling of vehicles
he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the
calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of
rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius
the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured
all at once he saw his shadow in front of him it was outlined on
a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely empurpled the
flooring vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gilded to his
right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage stupefied
behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed
through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense
obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying
it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer
in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a
