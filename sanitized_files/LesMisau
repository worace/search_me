ought to be able to see the old man and the child he looked as far as
his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had
wasted time some passers by informed him that the man and child of whom
he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny
they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked
fast and then he was well acquainted with the country
all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a
man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace
i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself
thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through
our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without
our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of
them it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged in a
calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to
make we will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest
trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being
given certain shocks arriving to bring his under nature to the surface
he had all the requisites for a blackguard he was a shopkeeper in
whom there was some taint of the monster satan must have occasionally
crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and
have fallen a dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece
bah he thought they will have time to make their escape
and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost
an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of
in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique
direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de
bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of
the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of
chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on
which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that mans hat
the brushwood was not high thenardier recognized the fact that the man
and cosette were sitting there the child could not be seen on account
of her small size but the head of her doll was visible
thenardier was not mistaken the man was sitting there and letting
cosette get somewhat rested the inn keeper walked round the brushwood
and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in
pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your
so saying he handed the stranger the three bank bills
it means sir that i shall take back cosette
cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man
he replied gazing to the very bottom of thenardiers eyes the while
you are go ing to take back co sette
yes sir i am i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact
i have not the right to give her to you i am an honest man you see
this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her
mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother you
will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only
give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by
her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person
the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier
beheld the pocket book of bank bills make its appearance once more
good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me
before opening the pocket book the traveller cast a glance about him
the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the
woods or in the valley the man opened his pocket book once more and
drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a
simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect
it certainly was fantines signature thenardier recognized it
there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the
vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the
you may keep this paper as your receipt
this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth
it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be
paid for all those little things a great deal is owing to me
the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his thread bare
monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed
you one hundred and twenty francs in february you sent her a bill of
five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of
february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then
nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed
upon which makes one hundred and thirty five francs you had received
one hundred francs too much that makes thirty five still owing you i
thenardiers sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he
feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap
who is this devil of a man he thought
he did what the wolf does he shook himself audacity had succeeded with
monsieur i dont know your name he said resolutely and this time
casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you
he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his
thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the
the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the inn keeper
while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders
which were a little rounded and his great fists
then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his
feeble arms and his thin hands i really must have been exceedingly
stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since
however the inn keeper did not give up
i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow
them at a distance two things were left on his hands an irony in
the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen
the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked
slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness
the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose
them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned
round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed
all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into
the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves the
deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace
the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when
the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled
round it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the
branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him
an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course the
inn keeper set out again in pursuit thus they continued for two or
three hundred paces all at once the man turned round once more he saw
the inn keeper this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that
thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further thenardier
chapter xi number 9430 reappears and cosette wins it in the lottery
when he fell into the sea or rather when he threw himself into it he
was not ironed as we have seen he swam under water until he reached a
vessel at anchor to which a boat was moored he found means of hiding
himself in this boat until night at night he swam off again and
reached the shore a little way from cape brun there as he did not lack
money he procured clothing a small country house in the neighborhood
of balaguier was at that time the dressing room of escaped convicts a
lucrative specialty then jean valjean like all the sorry fugitives
who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality
pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary he found his first
refuge at pradeaux near beausset then he directed his course towards
grand villard near briancon in the hautes alpes it was a fumbling and
uneasy flight a moles track whose branchings are untraceable later
on some trace of his passage into ain in the territory of civrieux
was discovered in the pyrenees at accons at the spot called
grange de doumec near the market of chavailles and in the environs of
perigueux at brunies canton of la chapelle gonaguet he reached paris
his first care on arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes
for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age then to procure
a lodging that done he had betaken himself to montfermeil it will
be remembered that already during his preceding escape he had made a
mysterious trip thither or somewhere in that neighborhood of which the
however he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the
obscurity which had gathered about him at paris one of the journals
which chronicled the fact fell into his hands he felt reassured and
almost at peace as though he had really been dead
on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the
claws of the thenardiers he returned to paris he re entered it at
nightfall with the child by way of the barrier monceaux there
he entered a cabriolet which took him to the esplanade of the
observatoire there he got out paid the coachman took cosette by
the hand and together they directed their steps through the
darkness through the deserted streets which adjoin the ourcine and the
the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette they
had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns behind
hedges they had changed carriages frequently they had travelled short
distances on foot she made no complaint but she was weary and jean
valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand
as she walked he took her on his back cosette without letting go
of catherine laid her head on jean valjeans shoulder and there fell
illustration the gorbeau hovel 2b3 10 gorbeau house
forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of
the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere ditalie by way
of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris
disappeared it was no longer solitude for there were passers by it
was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the
city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in
them it was not a village the houses were too lofty what was it
then it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert
place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a
street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day
it was the old quarter of the marche aux chevaux
the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of
this marche aux chevaux if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du
petit banquier after leaving on his right a garden protected by high
walls then a field in which tan bark mills rose like gigantic beaver
huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps
sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long
low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning
laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then
in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which
ran the inscription in large letters post no bills this daring
rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the
rue des vignes saint marcel there near a factory and between two
garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building
which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and
which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side
and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness nearly
the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be
the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never
have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it
had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry
might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion
the door was nothing but a collection of worm eaten planks roughly bound
together by cross beams which resembled roughly hewn logs it
opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky
plaster stained dusty steps of the same width as itself which
could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and
disappearing in the darkness between two walls the top of the shapeless
bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the
centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as
wicket and air hole when the door was closed on the inside of the
door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush
dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the
number 50 so that one hesitated where was one above the door it said
number 50 the inside replied no number 52 no one knows what
dust colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular
the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian
blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes
were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and
betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and
unpasted threatened passers by rather than screened the occupants
the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively
replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as
a blind ended as a shutter this door with an unclean and this window
with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house
produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side
with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a
mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman
the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which
had been converted into a house this edifice had for its intestinal
tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of
compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress
of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers
received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood
all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed
according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays
or by icy winds an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort
of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders
to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the
height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up
formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there
a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still
remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days
as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is
youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though mans lodging
partook of his ephemeral character and gods house of his eternity
the postmen called the house number 50 52 but it was known in the
let us explain whence this appellation was derived
collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and
prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there
was in paris during the last century about 1770 two attorneys at the
chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two
names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine
for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately
put in circulation in the galleries of the court house in verses that
the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the
bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which
followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the
their petition was presented to louis xv on the same day when the
papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la roche aymon on the
other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his
majestys presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who
had just got out of bed the king who was laughing continued to laugh
passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on
these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so by the kings
command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial
letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he
obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself
prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the
now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the
proprietor of the building numbered 50 52 on the boulevard de lhopital
he was even the author of the monumental window
hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house
opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm
which was three quarters dead almost directly facing it opens the rue
de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved
planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the
season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris an odor
of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory
the barrier was close at hand in 1823 the city wall was still in
this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind it was the
road to bicetre it was through it that under the empire and the
restoration prisoners condemned to death re entered paris on the day
of their execution it was there that about 1829 was committed that
mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau
barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy
problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has
never been unriddled take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue
croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the goat girl of ivry to the sound of
thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the
abominable pollarded elms of the barriere saint jacques that expedient
of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and
shameful place de grove of a shop keeping and bourgeois society which
recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with
leaving aside this place saint jacques which was as it were
predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most
mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago
was the spot which even to day is so unattractive where stood the
bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty five years later
the place was unpleasant in addition to the gloomy thoughts which
assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere
a glimpse of whose dome could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one
was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and
the madness of men as far as the eye could see one could perceive
nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few
factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood
hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerecloths new white
walls like winding sheets everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings
erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the
melancholy sadness of right angles not an unevenness of the ground
not a caprice in the architecture not a fold the ensemble was glacial
regular hideous nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry it is
because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief
despair yawns something more terrible than a hell where one suffers
may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored if such a hell
existed that bit of the boulevard de lhopital might have formed the
nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is
vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze
tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep
and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the
clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly
becomes frightful the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the
shades like morsels of the infinite the passer by cannot refrain from
recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected
with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have
been committed had something terrible about it one almost had a
presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused
forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of
which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it
was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister
in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated
at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old
however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique
air was tending even then to transformation even at that time any one
who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of
the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station
of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted
it as it does to day wherever it is placed on the borders of a
capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a
city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of
a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the
ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the
rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous
horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses
since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere
the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats saint victor and the
jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or
four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses
which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left
for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact
and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the
southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the
frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets the symptoms of a new
life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks
the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow
longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians one morning a
memorable morning in july 1845 black pots of bitumen were seen
smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had
arrived in the rue de lourcine and that paris had entered the suburb
chapter ii a nest for owl and a warbler
it was in front of this gorbeau house that jean valjean halted like
wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out a sort of a pass key
opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the
at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with
which he opened another door the chamber which he entered and which
he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic
furnished with a mattress laid on the floor a table and several
chairs a stove in which a fire was burning and whose embers were
visible stood in one corner a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague
light into this poor room at the extreme end there was a dressing room
with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid
he struck a match and lighted a candle all this was prepared beforehand
on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began
to scrutinize cosettes face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the
expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration the
little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme
strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with
whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was
jean valjean bent down and kissed that childs hand
nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also
the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart
lt was broad daylight and the child still slept a wan ray of the
december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the
ceiling in long threads of light and shade all at once a heavily laden
carriers cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the frail
bed like a clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom
yes madame cried cosette waking with a start here i am here i
and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness
of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall
she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean
ah so it is true said the child good morning monsieur
children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being
cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took
possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to
jean valjean where was she was paris very large was madame thenardier
very far away was she to go back etc etc all at once she exclaimed
it was a frightful hole but she felt free
the day passed thus cosette without troubling herself to understand
anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man
chapter iii two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune
on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by
cosettes bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake
some new thing had come into his soul
jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been
alone in the world he had never been father lover husband friend in
the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy
the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity his sister and his
sisters children had left him only a vague and far off memory which
had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to
find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them
human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he
had ever had any had fallen into an abyss
when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her
off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him
all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that
child he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with
joy he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it
meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to
love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing
poor old man with a perfectly new heart
only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that
might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together
it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop
had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the
the early days passed in this dazzled state
cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another
being poor little thing she was so little when her mother left her
that she no longer remembered her like all children who resemble young
shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love
she had not succeeded all had repulsed her the thenardiers their
children other children she had loved the dog and he had died after
which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her it is a sad
thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of
age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty
of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility thus from the
very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind
man she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of
the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she
thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty
these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy the novelty of
the earth and of life counts for something here nothing is so charming
as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our
nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between
jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly
united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted
existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed
the other cosettes instinct sought a father as jean valjeans
instinct sought a child to meet was to find each other at the
mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together
when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as
necessary to each other and embraced each other closely
taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we
may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean
valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation
caused jean valjean to become cosettes father after a celestial
and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the
depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping
hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of
that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god
moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well there he seemed
the chamber with a dressing room which he occupied with cosette was
the one whose window opened on the boulevard this being the only window
in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the
the ground floor of number 50 52 a sort of dilapidated penthouse
served as a wagon house for market gardeners and no communication
existed between it and the first story it was separated by the
flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the
diaphragm of the building as it were the first story contained as we
have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which
was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjeans
it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger
and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let
him the lodging on christmas eve he had represented himself to her as a
gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming
there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in
advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and
dressing room as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted
the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their
week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel
cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak children have their
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all
cracked with chilblains and kissed it the poor child who was used
to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in
at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette
was no longer in rags she was in mourning she had emerged from misery
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read sometimes as he made
the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil
that he had learned to read in prison this idea had ended in teaching a
child to read then the ex convict smiled with the pensive smile of the
he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who
was not man and he became absorbed in revery good thoughts have their
to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly
the whole of jean valjeans existence and then he talked of her mother
she called him father and knew no other name for him
he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in
listening to her prattle life henceforth appeared to him to be full
of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached
any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very
old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching
out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light the best
of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts at times he reflected
with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the
point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it
is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in
order that he might persevere in well doing he had just viewed the
malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete
aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth
the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as
personified in javert he had returned to prison this time for having
done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were
overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered
a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and
triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim
who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing
discouraged and of falling once more he loved and grew strong again
alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette he protected her
and she strengthened him thanks to him she could walk through life
thanks to her he could continue in virtue he was that childs stay
and she was his prop oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the
chapter iv the remarks of the principal tenant
jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening
at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with
cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and
entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to saint medard which is
the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained
with the old woman but the childs delight was to go out with the good
man she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete a tetes
with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things
it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person
the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to
they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in
very moderate circumstances jean valjean had made no alterations in
the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door
leading to cosettes dressing room replaced by a solid door
he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat
in the street he was taken for a poor man it sometimes happened that
kind hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean
accepted the sou with a deep bow it also happened occasionally that he
encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him
to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the
unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver
coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages he began
to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives
the old principal lodger a cross looking creature who was
thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the
inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean
a great deal without his suspecting the fact she was a little deaf
which rendered her talkative there remained to her from her past two
teeth one above the other below which she was continually knocking
against each other she had questioned cosette who had not been able
to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had
come from montfermeil one morning this spy saw jean valjean with
an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the
uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step
of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a
crack in the door which was directly opposite him jean valjean had his
back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt the
old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors
and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his
coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he
unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was
a bank bill for a thousand francs it was the second or third only that
she had seen in the course of her existence she fled in alarm
a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and
get this thousand franc bill changed for him adding that it was his
quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought
the old woman he did not go out until six oclock in the evening and
the government bank certainly is not open at that hour the old
woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises that
thousand franc note commented on and multiplied produced a vast
amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes
a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in
his shirt sleeves in the corridor the old woman was in the chamber
putting things in order she was alone cosette was occupied in admiring
the wood as it was sawed the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging
on a nail and examined it the lining had been sewed up again the good
woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and
revers thicknesses of paper more thousand franc bank bills no doubt
she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets
not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big
pocket book a very large knife and a suspicious circumstance several
wigs of various colors each pocket of this coat had the air of being in
thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter
chapter v a five franc piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult
near saint medards church there was a poor man who was in the habit of
crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and
on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity he never passed this
man without giving him a few sous sometimes he spoke to him those who
envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police he was an
ex beadle of seventy five who was constantly mumbling his prayers
one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette
with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern
which had just been lighted the man seemed engaged in prayer according
to his custom and was much bent over jean valjean stepped up to him
and placed his customary alms in his hand the mendicant raised his
eyes suddenly stared intently at jean valjean then dropped his head
quickly this movement was like a flash of lightning jean valjean was
seized with a shudder it seemed to him that he had just caught sight
by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming
visage of the old beadle but of a well known and startling face he
experienced the same impression that one would have on finding ones
self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger he
recoiled terrified petrified daring neither to breathe to speak
to remain nor to flee staring at the beggar who had dropped his head
which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appeared to know that he
was there at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious
instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a
word the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance
as he had every day bah said jean valjean i am mad i am dreaming
he hardly dared to confess even to himself that the face which he
thought he had seen was the face of javert
that night on thinking the matter over he regretted not having
questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second
on the following day at nightfall he went back the beggar was at his
post good day my good man said jean valjean resolutely handing
him a sou the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice
thanks my good sir it was unmistakably the ex beadle
jean valjean felt completely reassured he began to laugh how the
deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there he thought am i
going to lose my eyesight now and he thought no more about it
a few days afterwards it might have been at eight oclock in the
evening he was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell aloud
when he heard the house door open and then shut again this struck him
as singular the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house
except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not
burn out her candles jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet
he heard some one ascending the stairs it might possibly be the old
woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecarys
the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman
wore stout shoes and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the
step of a man as that of an old woman nevertheless jean valjean blew
he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed
very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused
jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the
door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his
after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he
heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his
chamber he saw a light through the keyhole this light formed a sort
of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall there was
evidently some one there who was holding a candle in his hand and
several minutes elapsed thus and the light retreated but he heard no
sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had
been listening at the door had removed his shoes
jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could
at daybreak just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue he was
awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the
end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had
ascended the stairs on the preceding evening the step was approaching
he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was
tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night
into the house and had listened at his door as he passed it was a
man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean
valjeans chamber the corridor was too dark to allow of the persons
face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase a
ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette and jean
valjean had a complete view of his back the man was of lofty stature
clad in a long frock coat with a cudgel under his arm the formidable
jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him
through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been
obliged to open the window he dared not
it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself
who had given him that key what was the meaning of this
when the old woman came to do the work at seven oclock in the morning
jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question
as she swept up she remarked to him
possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night
at that age and on that boulevard eight oclock in the evening was the
that is true by the way he replied in the most natural tone
it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the old woman
i dont know exactly dumont or daumont or some name of that sort
the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered
perhaps she had no ulterior meaning jean valjean thought he perceived
when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs
which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket in
spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he
might not be heard rattling silver a hundred sou piece escaped from his
when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides
of the boulevard he saw no one the boulevard appeared to be absolutely
deserted it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees
he took her by the hand and they both went out
