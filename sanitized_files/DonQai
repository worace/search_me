worships be it to strive to become a king and make me a count
so it shall be answered don quixote and raising his eyes he saw what
of the freedom don quixote conferred on several unfortunates who against
their will were being carried where they had no wish to go
cide hamete benengeli the arab and manchegan author relates in this
most grave high sounding minute delightful and original history that
after the discussion between the famous don quixote of la mancha and his
squire sancho panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty one
don quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was
following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck like beads
on a great iron chain and all with manacles on their hands with them
there came also two men on horseback and two on foot those on horseback
with wheel lock muskets those on foot with javelins and swords and as
that is a chain of galley slaves on the way to the galleys by force of
how by force asked don quixote is it possible that the king uses
i do not say that answered sancho but that these are people
condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the kings galleys
in fact replied don quixote however it may be these people are
going where they are taking them by force and not of their own will
then if so said don quixote here is a case for the exercise of my
office to put down force and to succour and help the wretched
recollect your worship said sancho justice which is the king
himself is not using force or doing wrong to such persons but punishing
the chain of galley slaves had by this time come up and don quixote in
very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good
enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting
these people in this manner one of the guards on horseback answered that
they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty that they were going to
the galleys and that was all that was to be said and all he had any
nevertheless replied don quixote i should like to know from each of
them separately the reason of his misfortune to this he added more to
the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that
though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of
every one of these wretches this is no time to take them out or read
them come and ask themselves they can tell if they choose and they
will for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about
with this permission which don quixote would have taken even had they
not granted it he approached the chain and asked the first for what
offences he was now in such a sorry case
he made answer that it was for being a lover
for that only replied don quixote why if for being lovers they send
people to the galleys i might have been rowing in them long ago
the love is not the sort your worship is thinking of said the galley
slave mine was that i loved a washerwomans basket of clean linen so
well and held it so close in my embrace that if the arm of the law had
not forced it from me i should never have let it go of my own will to
this moment i was caught in the act there was no occasion for torture
the case was settled they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back
and three years of gurapas besides and that was the end of it
gurapas are galleys answered the galley slave who was a young man of
about four and twenty and said he was a native of piedrahita
don quixote asked the same question of the second who made no reply so
downcast and melancholy was he but the first answered for him and said
he sir goes as a canary i mean as a musician and a singer
what said don quixote for being musicians and singers are people
yes sir answered the galley slave for there is nothing worse than
on the contrary i have heard say said don quixote that he who sings
here it is the reverse said the galley slave for he who sings once
i do not understand it said don quixote but one of the guards said to
him sir to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity
to confess under torture they put this sinner to the torture and he
confessed his crime which was being a cuatrero that is a
cattle stealer and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in
the galleys besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the
back and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves
that were left behind and that march here ill treat and snub and jeer
and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay
for say they nay has no more letters in it than yea and a culprit
is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not
on that of witnesses or evidence and to my thinking they are not very
and i think so too answered don quixote then passing on to the third
he asked him what he had asked the others and the man answered very
readily and unconcernedly i am going for five years to their ladyships
the gurapas for the want of ten ducats
i will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble said
that said the galley slave is like a man having money at sea when he
is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants i say so
because if at the right time i had had those twenty ducats that your
worship now offers me i would have greased the notarys pen and
freshened up the attorneys wit with them so that to day i should be in
the middle of the plaza of the zocodover at toledo and not on this road
coupled like a greyhound but god is great patience there thats
don quixote passed on to the fourth a man of venerable aspect with a
white beard falling below his breast who on hearing himself asked the
reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word but the
fifth acted as his tongue and said this worthy man is going to the
galleys for four years after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on
that means said sancho panza as i take it to have been exposed to
just so replied the galley slave and the offence for which they gave
him that punishment was having been an ear broker nay body broker i
mean in short that this gentleman goes as a pimp and for having
besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him
if that touch had not been thrown in said don quixote he would not
deserve for mere pimping to row in the galleys but rather to command
and be admiral of them for the office of pimp is no ordinary one being
the office of persons of discretion one very necessary in a well ordered
state and only to be exercised by persons of good birth nay there
ought to be an inspector and overseer of them as in other offices and
recognised number as with the brokers on change in this way many of the
evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being
in the hands of stupid and ignorant people such as women more or less
silly and pages and jesters of little standing and experience who on
the most urgent occasions and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed
let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths and know not which is
their right hand i should like to go farther and give reasons to show
that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an
office in the state but this is not the fit place for it some day i
will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it all i
say now is that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed
the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable
countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp
though i know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or
compel the will as some simple folk fancy for our will is free nor is
there herb or charm that can force it all that certain silly women and
quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons pretending that
they have power to cause love for as i say it is an impossibility to
it is true said the good old man and indeed sir as far as the
charge of sorcery goes i was not guilty as to that of being a pimp i
cannot deny it but i never thought i was doing any harm by it for my
only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace
and quiet without quarrels or troubles but my good intentions were
unavailing to save me from going where i never expect to come back from
with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives
me a moments ease and again he fell to weeping as before and such
compassion did sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from
his bosom and gave it to him in alms
don quixote went on and asked another what his crime was and the man
answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last
i am here because i carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of
mine and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine in short
i carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a
complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear
it was all proved against me i got no favour i had no money i was near
having my neck stretched they sentenced me to the galleys for six years
i accepted my fate it is the punishment of my fault i am a young man
let life only last and with that all will come right if you sir have
anything wherewith to help the poor god will repay it to you in heaven
and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the
life and health of your worship that they may be as long and as good as
this one was in the dress of a student and one of the guards said he was
a great talker and a very elegant latin scholar
behind all these there came a man of thirty a very personable fellow
except that when he looked his eyes turned in a little one towards the
other he was bound differently from the rest for he had to his leg a
chain so long that it was wound all round his body and two rings on his
neck one attached to the chain the other to what they call a
keep friend or friends foot from which hung two irons reaching to
his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured
by a big padlock so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth
nor lower his head to his hands don quixote asked why this man carried
so many more chains than the others the guard replied that it was
because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put
together and was so daring and such a villain that though they marched
him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him but were in dread of
what crimes can he have committed said don quixote if they have not
deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys
he goes for ten years replied the guard which is the same thing as
civil death and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the
famous gines de pasamonte otherwise called ginesillo de parapilla
gently senor commissary said the galley slave at this let us have
no fixing of names or surnames my name is gines not ginesillo and my
family name is pasamonte not parapilla as you say let each one mind his
own business and he will be doing enough
speak with less impertinence master thief of extra measure replied
the commissary if you dont want me to make you hold your tongue in
it is easy to see returned the galley slave that man goes as god
pleases but some one shall know some day whether i am called ginesillo
dont they call you so you liar said the guard
they do returned gines but i will make them give over calling me so
or i will be shaved where i only say behind my teeth if you sir have
anything to give us give it to us at once and god speed you for you
are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of
others if you want to know about mine let me tell you i am gines de
pasamonte whose life is written by these fingers
he says true said the commissary for he has himself written his
story as grand as you please and has left the book in the prison in pawn
and i mean to take it out of pawn said gines though it were in for
so good is it replied gines that a fig for lazarillo de tormes
and all of that kind that have been written or shall be written compared
with it all i will say about it is that it deals with facts and facts
so neat and diverting that no lies could match them
and how is the book entitled asked don quixote
the life of gines de pasamonte replied the subject of it
how can it be finished said the other when my life is not yet
finished all that is written is from my birth down to the point when
they sent me to the galleys this last time
then you have been there before said don quixote
in the service of god and the king i have been there for four years
before now and i know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are
like replied gines and it is no great grievance to me to go back to
them for there i shall have time to finish my book i have still many
things left to say and in the galleys of spain there is more than enough
leisure though i do not want much for what i have to write for i have
you seem a clever fellow said don quixote
and an unfortunate one replied gines for misfortune always
i told you already to go gently master commissary said pasamonte
their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill treat us
wretches here but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you
if not by the life of never mind  it may be that some day the stains
made in the inn will come out in the scouring let everyone hold his
tongue and behave well and speak better and now let us march on for we
the commissary lifted his staff to strike pasamonte in return for his
threats but don quixote came between them and begged him not to ill use
him as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have
his tongue a trifle free and turning to the whole chain of them he said
from all you have told me dear brethren make out clearly that though
they have punished you for your faults the punishments you are about to
endure do not give you much pleasure and that you go to them very much
against the grain and against your will and that perhaps this ones want
of courage under torture that ones want of money the others want of
advocacy and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been
the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had
on your side all which presents itself now to my mind urging
persuading and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the
purpose for which heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make
profession of the order of chivalry to which i belong and the vow i took
therein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the
strong but as i know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul
means what may be done by fair i will ask these gentlemen the guards
and commissary to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace
as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more
favourable circumstances for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves
of those whom god and nature have made free moreover sirs of the
guard added don quixote these poor fellows have done nothing to you
let each answer for his own sins yonder there is a god in heaven who
will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good and it is not
fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to
others they being therein no way concerned this request i make thus
gently and quietly that if you comply with it i may have reason for
thanking you and if you will not voluntarily this lance and sword
together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by
nice nonsense said the commissary a fine piece of pleasantry he has
come out with at last he wants us to let the kings prisoners go as if
we had any authority to release them or he to order us to do so go your
way sir and good luck to you put that basin straight that youve got
on your head and dont go looking for three feet on a cat
tis you that are the cat rat and rascal replied don quixote and
acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him
time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a
lance thrust and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the
musket the other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this
unexpected event but recovering presence of mind those on horseback
seized their swords and those on foot their javelins and attacked don
quixote who was waiting for them with great calmness and no doubt it
would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves seeing the chance
before them of liberating themselves had not effected it by contriving
to break the chain on which they were strung such was the confusion
that the guards now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking
loose now to attack don quixote who was waiting for them did nothing at
all that was of any use sancho on his part gave a helping hand to
release gines de pasamonte who was the first to leap forth upon the
plain free and unfettered and who attacking the prostrate commissary
took from him his sword and the musket with which aiming at one and
levelling at another he without ever discharging it drove every one of
the guards off the field for they took to flight as well to escape
pasamontes musket as the showers of stones the now released galley
slaves were raining upon them sancho was greatly grieved at the affair
because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to
the holy brotherhood who at the summons of the alarm bell would at once
sally forth in quest of the offenders and he said so to his master and
entreated him to leave the place at once and go into hiding in the
that is all very well said don quixote but i know what must be done
now and calling together all the galley slaves who were now running
riot and had stripped the commissary to the skin he collected them
round him to hear what he had to say and addressed them as follows to
be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth
and one of the sins most offensive to god is ingratitude i say so
because sirs ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have
received of me in return for which i desire and it is my good pleasure
that laden with that chain which i have taken off your necks ye at once
set out and proceed to the city of el toboso and there present
yourselves before the lady dulcinea del toboso and say to her that her
knight he of the rueful countenance sends to commend himself to her
and that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this
notable adventure up to the recovery of your longed for liberty and
this done ye may go where ye will and good fortune attend you
gines de pasamonte made answer for all saying that which you sir our
deliverer demand of us is of all impossibilities the most impossible to
comply with because we cannot go together along the roads but only
singly and separate and each one his own way endeavouring to hide
ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the holy brotherhood
which no doubt will come out in search of us what your worship may do
and fairly do is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady
dulcinea del toboso for a certain quantity of ave marias and credos which
we will say for your worships intention and this is a condition that
can be complied with by night as by day running or resting in peace or
in war but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh pots
of egypt i mean to take up our chain and set out for el toboso is to
imagine that it is now night though it is not yet ten in the morning
and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree
then by all thats good said don quixote now stirred to wrath don
son of a bitch don ginesillo de paropillo or whatever your name is you
will have to go yourself alone with your tail between your legs and the
pasamonte who was anything but meek being by this time thoroughly
convinced that don quixote was not quite right in his head as he had
committed such a vagary as to set them free finding himself abused in
this fashion gave the wink to his companions and falling back they
began to shower stones on don quixote at such a rate that he was quite
unable to protect himself with his buckler and poor rocinante no more
heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass sancho planted himself
behind his ass and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that
poured on both of them don quixote was unable to shield himself so well
but that more pebbles than i could count struck him full on the body with
such force that they brought him to the ground and the instant he fell
the student pounced upon him snatched the basin from his head and with
it struck three or four blows on his shoulders and as many more on the
ground knocking it almost to pieces they then stripped him of a jacket
that he wore over his armour and they would have stripped off his
stockings if his greaves had not prevented them from sancho they took
his coat leaving him in his shirt sleeves and dividing among themselves
the remaining spoils of the battle they went each one his own way more
solicitous about keeping clear of the holy brotherhood they dreaded than
about burdening themselves with the chain or going to present themselves
before the lady dulcinea del toboso the ass and rocinante sancho and
don quixote were all that were left upon the spot the ass with drooping
head serious shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the
storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over rocinante stretched
beside his master for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone
sancho stripped and trembling with fear of the holy brotherhood and don
quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he
of what befell don quixote in the sierra morena which was one of the
seeing himself served in this way don quixote said to his squire i
have always heard it said sancho that to do good to boors is to throw
water into the sea if i had believed thy words i should have avoided
this trouble but it is done now it is only to have patience and take
your worship will take warning as much as i am a turk returned sancho
but as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had
believed me believe me now and a still greater one will be avoided for
i tell you chivalry is of no account with the holy brotherhood and they
dont care two maravedis for all the knights errant in the world and i
can tell you i fancy i hear their arrows whistling past my ears this
thou art a coward by nature sancho said don quixote but lest thou
shouldst say i am obstinate and that i never do as thou dost advise
this once i will take thy advice and withdraw out of reach of that fury
thou so dreadest but it must be on one condition that never in life or
in death thou art to say to anyone that i retired or withdrew from this
danger out of fear but only in compliance with thy entreaties for if
thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein and from this time to that
and from that to this i give thee lie and say thou liest and wilt lie
every time thou thinkest or sayest it and answer me not again for at
the mere thought that i am withdrawing or retiring from any danger above
all from this which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with
it i am ready to take my stand here and await alone not only that holy
brotherhood you talk of and dread but the brothers of the twelve tribes
of israel and the seven maccabees and castor and pollux and all the
senor replied sancho to retire is not to flee and there is no
wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope and it is the part of wise
men to preserve themselves to day for to morrow and not risk all in one
day and let me tell you though i am a clown and a boor i have got some
notion of what they call safe conduct so repent not of having taken my
advice but mount rocinante if you can and if not i will help you and
follow me for my mother wit tells me we have more need of legs than
don quixote mounted without replying and sancho leading the way on his
ass they entered the side of the sierra morena which was close by as
it was sanchos design to cross it entirely and come out again at el viso
or almodovar del campo and hide for some days among its crags so as to
escape the search of the brotherhood should they come to look for them
he was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions
carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves
a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle seeing how they pillaged
that night they reached the very heart of the sierra morena where it
seemed prudent to sancho to pass the night and even some days at least
as many as the stores he carried might last and so they encamped between
two rocks and among some cork trees but fatal destiny which according
to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith
directs arranges and settles everything in its own way so ordered it
that gines de pasamonte the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and
madness of don quixote had been released from the chain driven by fear
of the holy brotherhood which he had good reason to dread resolved to
take hiding in the mountains and his fate and fear led him to the same
spot to which don quixote and sancho panza had been led by theirs just
in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep and as the
wicked are always ungrateful and necessity leads to evildoing and
immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future gines
who was neither grateful nor well principled made up his mind to steal
sancho panzas ass not troubling himself about rocinante as being a
prize that was no good either to pledge or sell while sancho slept he
stole his ass and before day dawned he was far out of reach
aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to
sancho panza for he found that his dapple was missing and seeing
himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the
world so loud that don quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him
saying o son of my bowels born in my very house my childrens
plaything my wifes joy the envy of my neighbours relief of my
burdens and lastly half supporter of myself for with the
six and twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily i met half my charges
don quixote when he heard the lament and learned the cause consoled
sancho with the best arguments he could entreating him to be patient
and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five
ass colts that he had at home to be given to him sancho took comfort at
this dried his tears suppressed his sobs and returned thanks for the
kindness shown him by don quixote he on his part was rejoiced to the
heart on entering the mountains as they seemed to him to be just the
place for the adventures he was in quest of they brought back to his
memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights errant in like
solitudes and wilds and he went along reflecting on these things so
absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything
nor had sancho any other care now that he fancied he was travelling in a
safe quarter than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were left
of the clerical spoils and so he marched behind his master laden with
what dapple used to carry emptying the sack and packing his paunch and
so long as he could go that way he would not have given a farthing to
while so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted
and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object that
lay upon the ground on which he hastened to join him and help him if it
were needful and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was
raising a saddle pad with a valise attached to it half or rather wholly
rotten and torn but so heavy were they that sancho had to help to take
them up and his master directed him to see what the valise contained
sancho did so with great alacrity and though the valise was secured by a
chain and padlock from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see
its contents which were four shirts of fine holland and other articles
of linen no less curious than clean and in a handkerchief he found a
good lot of gold crowns and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed
blessed be all heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for
searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound this
don quixote asked of him telling him to take the money and keep it for
himself sancho kissed his hands for the favour and cleared the valise
of its linen which he stowed away in the provision sack considering the
it seems to me sancho and it is impossible it can be otherwise that
some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked
and slain by footpads who brought him to this remote spot to bury him
that cannot be answered sancho because if they had been robbers they
thou art right said don quixote and i cannot guess or explain what
this may mean but stay let us see if in this memorandum book there is
anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we
he opened it and the first thing he found in it written roughly but in
a very good hand was a sonnet and reading it aloud that sancho might
hear it he found that it ran as follows
or else it is my doom to suffer pains
but if love be a god it follows thence
that he knows all and certain it remains
it were a falsehood chloe thee to name
and against heaven i dare not charge the blame
i only know it is my fate to die
to him who knows not whence his malady
there is nothing to be learned from that rhyme said sancho unless by
that clue theres in it one may draw out the ball of the whole matter
i thought your worship spoke of a clue in it said sancho
i only said chloe replied don quixote and that no doubt is the name
of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains and faith he
must be a tolerable poet or i know little of the craft
and better than thou thinkest replied don quixote as thou shalt see
when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my
lady dulcinea del toboso for i would have thee know sancho that all or
most of the knights errant in days of yore were great troubadours and
great musicians for both of these accomplishments or more properly
speaking gifts are the peculiar property of lovers errant true it is
that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in
read more your worship said sancho and you will find something that
don quixote turned the page and said this is prose and seems to be a
from the beginning it seems to be a love letter replied don quixote
then let your worship read it aloud said sancho for i am very fond
with all my heart said don quixote and reading it aloud as sancho had
thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the
news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint
ungrateful one thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy but not more
worthy but if virtue were esteemed wealth i should neither envy the
fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own what thy beauty
raised up thy deeds have laid low by it i believed thee to be an angel
by them i know thou art a woman peace be with thee who hast sent war to
me and heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from
thee so that thou repent not of what thou hast done and i reap not a
when he had finished the letter don quixote said there is less to be
gathered from this than from the verses except that he who wrote it is
some rejected lover and turning over nearly all the pages of the book
he found more verses and letters some of which he could read while
others he could not but they were all made up of complaints laments
misgivings desires and aversions favours and rejections some
rapturous some doleful while don quixote examined the book sancho
examined the valise not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the
pad that he did not search peer into and explore or seam that he did
not rip or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces lest anything
should escape for want of care and pains so keen was the covetousness
excited in him by the discovery of the crowns which amounted to near a
hundred and though he found no more booty he held the blanket flights
alforjas stolen coat and all the hunger thirst and weariness he had
endured in the service of his good master cheap at the price as he
considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he
received in the gift of the treasure trove
the knight of the rueful countenance was still very anxious to find out
who the owner of the valise could be conjecturing from the sonnet and
letter from the money in gold and from the fineness of the shirts that
he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his
lady had driven to some desperate course but as in that uninhabited and
rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire he saw
nothing else for it but to push on taking whatever road rocinante
chose which was where he could make his way firmly persuaded that among
these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure as he went
along then occupied with these thoughts he perceived on the summit of
a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock
to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility as well as
he could make out he was unclad with a thick black beard long tangled
hair and bare legs and feet his thighs were covered by breeches
apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in
he was bareheaded and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed
as has been described the knight of the rueful countenance observed and
noted all these trifles and though he made the attempt he was unable to
follow him for it was not granted to the feebleness of rocinante to make
way over such rough ground he being moreover slow paced and sluggish
by nature don quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the
owner of the saddle pad and of the valise and made up his mind to go in
search of him even though he should have to wander a year in those
mountains before he found him and so he directed sancho to take a short
cut over one side of the mountain while he himself went by the other
and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed
i could not do that said sancho for when i separate from your
worship fear at once lays hold of me and assails me with all sorts of
panics and fancies and let what i now say be a notice that from this
time forth i am not going to stir a fingers width from your presence
it shall be so said he of the rueful countenance and i am very glad
that thou art willing to rely on my courage which will never fail thee
even though the soul in thy body fail thee so come on now behind me
slowly as well as thou canst and make lanterns of thine eyes let us
make the circuit of this ridge perhaps we shall light upon this man that
we saw who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found
to which sancho made answer far better would it be not to look for him
for if we find him and he happens to be the owner of the money it is
plain i must restore it it would be better therefore that without
taking this needless trouble i should keep possession of it until in
some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be
discovered and perhaps that will be when i shall have spent it and then
thou art wrong there sancho said don quixote for now that we have a
suspicion who the owner is and have him almost before us we are bound
to seek him and make restitution and if we do not see him the strong
suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he
were so and so friend sancho let not our search for him give thee any
uneasiness for if we find him it will relieve mine
and so saying he gave rocinante the spur and sancho followed him on foot
and loaded and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they
found lying in a ravine dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by
jackdaws a mule saddled and bridled all which still further
strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the
as they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd
watching his flock and suddenly on their left there appeared a great
number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the
goatherd in charge of them a man advanced in years don quixote called
aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood he shouted
in return asking what had brought them to that spot seldom or never
trodden except by the feet of goats or of the wolves and other wild
beasts that roamed around sancho in return bade him come down and they
the goatherd descended and reaching the place where don quixote stood
he said i will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead
in the hollow there and faith it has been lying there now these six
months tell me have you come upon its master about here
we have come upon nobody answered don quixote nor on anything except
a saddle pad and a little valise that we found not far from this
i found it too said the goatherd but i would not lift it nor go near
it for fear of some ill luck or being charged with theft for the devil
is crafty and things rise up under ones feet to make one fall without
thats exactly what i say said sancho i found it too and i would
not go within a stones throw of it there i left it and there it lies
just as it was for i dont want a dog with a bell
tell me good man said don quixote do you know who is the owner of
all i can tell you said the goatherd is that about six months ago
more or less there arrived at a shepherds hut three leagues perhaps
away from this a youth of well bred appearance and manners mounted on
that same mule which lies dead here and with the same saddle pad and
valise which you say you found and did not touch he asked us what part
of this sierra was the most rugged and retired we told him that it was
where we now are and so in truth it is for if you push on half a league
farther perhaps you will not be able to find your way out and i am
wondering how you have managed to come here for there is no road or path
that leads to this spot i say then that on hearing our answer the
youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him leaving
us all charmed with his good looks and wondering at his question and the
haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra and
after that we saw him no more until some days afterwards he crossed the
path of one of our shepherds and without saying a word to him came up
to him and gave him several cuffs and kicks and then turned to the ass
with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried and
having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary
swiftness when some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of
him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra at
the end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork
tree he came out to meet us with great gentleness with his dress now
torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun that we hardly
recognised him but that his clothes though torn convinced us from the
recollection we had of them that he was the person we were looking for
he saluted us courteously and in a few well spoken words he told us not
to wonder at seeing him going about in this guise as it was binding upon
him in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had
been imposed upon him we asked him to tell us who he was but we were
never able to find out from him we begged of him too when he was in
want of food which he could not do without to tell us where we should
find him as we would bring it to him with all good will and readiness
or if this were not to his taste at least to come and ask it of us and
not take it by force from the shepherds he thanked us for the offer
begged pardon for the late assault and promised for the future to ask it
in gods name without offering violence to anybody as for fixed abode
he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night
might overtake him and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so
bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we not
joined him in it comparing what we saw of him the first time with what
we saw now for as i said he was a graceful and gracious youth and in
his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good birth
and courtly breeding and rustics as we were that listened to him even
to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain
but in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent
keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time during which we
stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction
and with no little pity for from his behaviour now staring at the
ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid again
closing them compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows we could
perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him
and before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth for he
arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown himself and attacked
the first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had
not dragged him off him he would have beaten or bitten him to death all
the while exclaiming oh faithless fernando here here shalt thou pay
the penalty of the wrong thou hast done me these hands shall tear out
that heart of thine abode and dwelling of all iniquity but of deceit
and fraud above all and to these he added other words all in effect
upbraiding this fernando and charging him with treachery and
we forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty and without
another word he left us and rushing off plunged in among these brakes
and brambles so as to make it impossible for us to follow him from this
we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time and that some
one called fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such
as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to show all this has
been since then confirmed on those occasions and they have been many on
which he has crossed our path at one time to beg the shepherds to give
him some of the food they carry at another to take it from them by
force for when there is a fit of madness upon him even though the
shepherds offer it freely he will not accept it but snatches it from
them by dint of blows but when he is in his senses he begs it for the
love of god courteously and civilly and receives it with many thanks
and not a few tears and to tell you the truth sirs continued the
goatherd it was yesterday that we resolved i and four of the lads two
of them our servants and the other two friends of mine to go in search
of him until we find him and when we do to take him whether by force or
of his own consent to the town of almodovar which is eight leagues from
this and there strive to cure him if indeed his malady admits of a
cure or learn when he is in his senses who he is and if he has
relatives to whom we may give notice of his misfortune this sirs is
all i can say in answer to what you have asked me and be sure that the
owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such
for don quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding
along the mountain side and he was now filled with amazement at what he
heard from the goatherd and more eager than ever to discover who the
unhappy madman was and in his heart he resolved as he had done before
to search for him all over the mountain not leaving a corner or cave
unexamined until he had found him but chance arranged matters better
than he expected or hoped for at that very moment in a gorge on the
mountain that opened where they stood the youth he wished to find made
his appearance coming along talking to himself in a way that would have
been unintelligible near at hand much more at a distance his garb was
what has been described save that as he drew near don quixote perceived
that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber tanned from which he
concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank
approaching them the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but
with great courtesy don quixote returned his salutation with equal
politeness and dismounting from rocinante advanced with well bred
bearing and grace to embrace him and held him for some time close in his
arms as if he had known him for a long time the other whom we may call
the ragged one of the sorry countenance as don quixote was of the
rueful after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and
placing his hands on don quixotes shoulders stood gazing at him as if
seeking to see whether he knew him not less amazed perhaps at the
sight of the face figure and armour of don quixote than don quixote was
at the sight of him to be brief the first to speak after embracing was
the ragged one and he said what will be told farther on
in which is continued the adventure of the sierra morena
the history relates that it was with the greatest attention don quixote
listened to the ragged knight of the sierra who began by saying
of a surety senor whoever you are for i know you not i thank you for
the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me and would i were
in a condition to requite with something more than good will that which
you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me
but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses
done me save the hearty desire to repay them
mine replied don quixote is to be of service to you so much so that
i had resolved not to quit these mountains until i had found you and
learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that
sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour
and to search for you with all possible diligence if search had been
necessary and if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that
refuse admission to any sort of consolation it was my purpose to join
you in lamenting and mourning over it so far as i could for it is still
some comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it and if my
good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy i
entreat you senor by that which i perceive you possess in so high a
degree and likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best
in life to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to
live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast dwelling among them in
a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show
and i swear added don quixote by the order of knighthood which i have
received and by my vocation of knight errant if you gratify me in this
to serve you with all the zeal my calling demands of me either in
relieving your misfortune if it admits of relief or in joining you in
the knight of the thicket hearing him of the rueful countenance talk in
this strain did nothing but stare at him and stare at him again and
again survey him from head to foot and when he had thoroughly examined
if you have anything to give me to eat for gods sake give it me and
after i have eaten i will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the
sancho from his sack and the goatherd from his pouch furnished the
ragged one with the means of appeasing his hunger and what they gave him
he ate like a half witted being so hastily that he took no time between
mouthfuls gorging rather than swallowing and while he ate neither he
nor they who observed him uttered a word as soon as he had done he made
signs to them to follow him which they did and he led them to a green
plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock on
reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass and the others did the
same all keeping silence until the ragged one settling himself in his
if it is your wish sirs that i should disclose in a few words the
surpassing extent of my misfortunes you must promise not to break the
thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption for the
instant you do so the tale i tell will come to an end
these words of the ragged one reminded don quixote of the tale his squire
had told him when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed
the river and the story remained unfinished but to return to the ragged
i give you this warning because i wish to pass briefly over the story of
my misfortunes for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh
ones and the less you question me the sooner shall i make an end of the
recital though i shall not omit to relate anything of importance in
don quixote gave the promise for himself and the others and with this
my name is cardenio my birthplace one of the best cities of this
andalusia my family noble my parents rich my misfortune so great that
my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being
able by their wealth to lighten it for the gifts of fortune can do
little to relieve reverses sent by heaven in that same country there was
a heaven in which love had placed all the glory i could desire such was
the beauty of luscinda a damsel as noble and as rich as i but of
happier fortunes and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a
passion as mine this luscinda i loved worshipped and adored from my
earliest and tenderest years and she loved me in all the innocence and
sincerity of childhood our parents were aware of our feelings and were
not sorry to perceive them for they saw clearly that as they ripened
they must lead at last to a marriage between us a thing that seemed
almost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth we grew
up and with our growth grew the love between us so that the father of
luscinda felt bound for proprietys sake to refuse me admission to his
house in this perhaps imitating the parents of that thisbe so celebrated
by the poets and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame
for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose
it upon our pens which can make known the hearts secrets to a loved one
more freely than tongues for many a time the presence of the object of
love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue ah
heavens how many letters did i write her and how many dainty modest
replies did i receive how many ditties and love songs did i compose in
which my heart declared and made known its feelings described its ardent
longings revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires at
length growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to
see her i resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me
the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward to ask her of her
father for my lawful wife which i did to this his answer was that he
thanked me for the disposition i showed to do honour to him and to regard
myself as honoured by the bestowal of his treasure but that as my father
was alive it was his by right to make this demand for if it were not in
accordance with his full will and pleasure luscinda was not to be taken
or given by stealth i thanked him for his kindness reflecting that
there was reason in what he said and that my father would assent to it
as soon as i should tell him and with that view i went the very same
instant to let him know what my desires were when i entered the room
where he was i found him with an open letter in his hand which before i
could utter a word he gave me saying by this letter thou wilt see
cardenio the disposition the duke ricardo has to serve thee this duke
ricardo as you sirs probably know already is a grandee of spain who
has his seat in the best part of this andalusia i took and read the
letter which was couched in terms so flattering that even i myself felt
it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke
made in it which was that he would send me immediately to him as he
wished me to become the companion not servant of his eldest son and
would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position
corresponding to the esteem in which he held me on reading the letter my
voice failed me and still more when i heard my father say two days
hence thou wilt depart cardenio in accordance with the dukes wish and
give thanks to god who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest
attain what i know thou dost deserve and to these words he added others
of fatherly counsel the time for my departure arrived i spoke one night
