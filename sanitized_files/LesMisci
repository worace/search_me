never mind you cut folks throats too cheap altogether
that done he once more drew the big key from under his blouse
now my friend you must leave its like the fair here you pay when
you go out you have paid now clear out
had he in lending to this stranger the aid of his key and in making
some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and
disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin we may be permitted to
thenardier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then
he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean
valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth
and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection
finished he placed the key in the lock the bolt slipped back and the
gate swung open it neither grated nor squeaked it moved very softly
it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were
in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed this
softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and comings silent
entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the wolf like tread of crime
the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band this
taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods
thenardier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space
for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key
a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without
making any more noise than a breath he seemed to walk with the velvet
a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the
jean valjean found himself in the open air
chapter ix marius produces on some one who is a judge of the matter
he allowed marius to slide down upon the shore
the miasmas darkness horror lay behind him the pure healthful
living joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him everywhere
around him reigned silence but that charming silence when the sun has
set in an unclouded azure sky twilight had descended night was drawing
on the great deliverer the friend of all those who need a mantle of
darkness that they may escape from an anguish the sky presented itself
in all directions like an enormous calm the river flowed to his feet
with the sound of a kiss the aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each
other good night in the elms of the champs elysees was audible a few
stars daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith and visible to
revery alone formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity
evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of
it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no
night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose
oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to
for several seconds jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that
august and caressing serenity such moments of oblivion do come to men
suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch everything is
eclipsed in the thoughts peace broods over the dreamer like night and
beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is
illuminated the soul becomes studded with stars jean valjean could
not refrain from contemplating that vast clear shadow which rested
over him thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the
majestic silence of the eternal heavens then he bent down swiftly
to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and
dipping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled a
few drops on the latters face marius eyelids did not open but his
jean valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once
more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment
such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does
we have already alluded to this impression with which everyone is
some one was in fact behind him as there had been a short while
a man of lofty stature enveloped in a long coat with folded arms
and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was
visible stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where jean valjean
with the aid of the darkness it seemed a sort of apparition an
ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight a
thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon jean valjean recognized
the reader has divined no doubt that thenardiers pursuer was no other
than javert javert after his unlooked for escape from the barricade
had betaken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered a
verbal account to the prefect in person in a brief audience had then
immediately gone on duty again which implied the note the reader will
recollect which had been captured on his person a certain surveillance
of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the champs elysees
which had for some time past aroused the attention of the police
there he had caught sight of thenardier and had followed him the reader
thus it will be easily understood that that grating so obligingly
opened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on thenardiers part
thenardier intuitively felt that javert was still there the man spied
upon has a scent which never deceives him it was necessary to fling
a bone to that sleuth hound an assassin what a godsend such an
opportunity must never be allowed to slip thenardier by putting jean
valjean outside in his stead provided a prey for the police forced
them to relinquish his scent made them forget him in a bigger
adventure repaid javert for his waiting which always flatters a spy
earned thirty francs and counted with certainty so far as he himself
was concerned on escaping with the aid of this diversion
jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another
these two encounters this falling one after the other from thenardier
javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated no longer
looked like himself he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his
bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a curt
javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth bent his knees inclined
his body laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of jean valjean
which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices scrutinized
him and recognized him their faces almost touched javerts look was
jean valjean remained inert beneath javerts grasp like a lion
inspector javert said he you have me in your power moreover i
have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning i did not
give you my address with any intention of escaping from you take me
javert did not appear to hear him he kept his eyes riveted on jean
valjean his chin being contracted thrust his lips upwards towards
his nose a sign of savage revery at length he released jean valjean
straightened himself stiffly up without bending grasped his bludgeon
again firmly and as though in a dream he murmured rather than uttered
what are you doing here and who is this man
he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou
jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse
it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you dispose of me
as you see fit but first help me to carry him home that is all that i
javerts face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to
think him capable of making a concession nevertheless he did not say
again he bent over drew from his pocket a handkerchief which
he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius
this man was at the barricade said he in a low voice and as though
speaking to himself he is the one they called marius
a spy of the first quality who had observed everything listened to
everything and taken in everything even when he thought that he was to
die who had played the spy even in his agony and who with his elbows
leaning on the first step of the sepulchre had taken notes
he seized marius hand and felt his pulse
so you have brought him thither from the barricade remarked javert
his preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to
insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer and for him not to
even notice jean valjeans silence after his question
jean valjean on his side seemed to have but one thought he resumed
he lives in the marais rue des filles du calvaire with his
jean valjean fumbled in marius coat pulled out his pocket book opened
it at the page which marius had pencilled and held it out to javert
there was still sufficient light to admit of reading besides this
javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night
birds he deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered
gillenormand rue des filles du calvaire no 6
the reader will remember that the hackney coach was waiting in case of
a moment later the carriage which had descended by the inclined plane
of the watering place was on the shore marius was laid upon the back
seat and javert seated himself on the front seat beside jean valjean
the door slammed and the carriage drove rapidly away ascending the
they quitted the quays and entered the streets the coachman a black
form on his box whipped up his thin horses a glacial silence reigned
in the carriage marius motionless with his body resting in the
corner and his head drooping on his breast his arms hanging his legs
stiff seemed to be awaiting only a coffin jean valjean seemed made of
shadow and javert of stone and in that vehicle full of night whose
interior every time that it passed in front of a street lantern
appeared to be turned lividly wan as by an intermittent flash of
lightning chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face
the three forms of tragic immobility the corpse the spectre and the
chapter x return of the son who was prodigal of his life
at every jolt over the pavement a drop of blood trickled from marius
night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at no 6 rue des
javert was the first to alight he made sure with one glance of the
number on the carriage gate and raising the heavy knocker of beaten
iron embellished in the old style with a male goat and a satyr
confronting each other he gave a violent peal the gate opened a little
way and javert gave it a push the porter half made his appearance
yawning vaguely awake and with a candle in his hand
everyone in the house was asleep people go to bed betimes in the
marais especially on days when there is a revolt this good old
quarter terrified at the revolution takes refuge in slumber as
children when they hear the bugaboo coming hide their heads hastily
in the meantime jean valjean and the coachman had taken marius out of
the carriage jean valjean supporting him under the armpits and the
as they thus bore marius jean valjean slipped his hand under the
latters clothes which were broadly rent felt his breast and assured
himself that his heart was still beating it was even beating a little
less feebly as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a
javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government and the
presence of the porter of a factious person
jean valjean who soiled and tattered stood behind javert and whom
the porter was surveying with some horror made a sign to him with his
the porter did not appear to understand either javerts words or jean
he went to the barricade and here he is
he has got himself killed go waken his father
there will be a funeral here to morrow
for javert the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically
classed which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance and each
contingency had its own compartment all possible facts were arranged
in drawers as it were whence they emerged on occasion in variable
quantities in the street uproar revolt carnival and funeral
the porter contented himself with waking basque basque woke nicolette
as for the grandfather they let him sleep on thinking that he would
hear about the matter early enough in any case
marius was carried up to the first floor without any one in the other
parts of the house being aware of the fact and deposited on an old sofa
in m gillenormands antechamber and while basque went in search of a
physician and while nicolette opened the linen presses jean valjean
felt javert touch him on the shoulder he understood and descended the
stairs having behind him the step of javert who was following him
the porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their
they entered the carriage once more and the coachman mounted his box
inspector javert said jean grant me yet another favor
let me go home for one instant then you shall do whatever you like
javert remained silent for a few moments with his chin drawn back into
the collar of his great coat then he lowered the glass and front
driver said he rue de lhomme arme no 7
they did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride
what did jean valjean want to finish what he had begun to warn
cosette to tell her where marius was to give her possibly some other
useful information to take if he could certain final measures as
for himself so far as he was personally concerned all was over he had
been seized by javert and had not resisted any other man than himself
in like situation would perhaps have had some vague thoughts connected
with the rope which thenardier had given him and of the bars of the
first cell that he should enter but let us impress it upon the
reader after the bishop there had existed in jean valjean a profound
hesitation in the presence of any violence even when directed against
suicide that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may
contain in a measure the death of the soul was impossible to jean
at the entrance to the rue de lhomme arme the carriage halted the way
being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles javert and jean
the coachman humbly represented to monsieur linspecteur that the
utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the
assassinated man and with mire from the assassin that is the way he
understood it he added that an indemnity was due him at the same time
drawing his certificate book from his pocket he begged the inspector to
have the goodness to write him a bit of an attestation
javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him and
how much do you want including your time of waiting and the drive
it comes to seven hours and a quarter replied the man and my velvet
javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage
jean valjean fancied that it was javerts intention to conduct him on
foot to the post of the blancs manteaux or to the post of the archives
they entered the street it was deserted as usual javert followed jean
valjean they reached no 7 jean valjean knocked the door opened
it is well said javert go up stairs
he added with a strange expression and as though he were exerting an
jean valjean looked at javert this mode of procedure was but little in
accord with javerts habits however he could not be greatly surprised
that javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him the
confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of
its claws seeing that jean valjean had made up his mind to surrender
himself and to make an end of it he pushed open the door entered the
house called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord
from his couch it is i and ascended the stairs
on arriving at the first floor he paused all sorrowful roads
have their stations the window on the landing place which was a
sash window was open as in many ancient houses the staircase got its
light from without and had a view on the street the street lantern
situated directly opposite cast some light on the stairs and thus
jean valjean either for the sake of getting the air or mechanically
thrust his head out of this window he leaned out over the street it
is short and the lantern lighted it from end to end jean valjean was
overwhelmed with amazement there was no longer any one there
basque and the porter had carried marius into the drawing room as he
still lay stretched out motionless on the sofa upon which he had been
placed on his arrival the doctor who had been sent for had hastened
aunt gillenormand went and came in affright wringing her hands and
incapable of doing anything but saying heavens is it possible at
times she added everything will be covered with blood when her first
horror had passed off a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated
her mind and took form in the exclamation it was bound to end in this
way she did not go so far as i told you so which is customary on
this sort of occasion at the physicians orders a camp bed had been
prepared beside the sofa the doctor examined marius and after having
found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very
deep wound on his breast and that the blood on the corners of his lips
proceeded from his nostrils he had him placed flat on the bed without
a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a
trifle lower and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration
mademoiselle gillenormand on perceiving that they were undressing
marius withdrew she set herself to telling her beads in her own
the trunk had not suffered any internal injury a bullet deadened by
the pocket book had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a
hideous laceration which was of no great depth and consequently not
dangerous the long underground journey had completed the dislocation
of the broken collar bone and the disorder there was serious the arms
had been slashed with sabre cuts not a single scar disfigured his face
but his head was fairly covered with cuts what would be the result of
these wounds on the head would they stop short at the hairy cuticle or
would they attack the brain as yet this could not be decided a grave
symptom was that they had caused a swoon and that people do not always
recover from such swoons moreover the wounded man had been exhausted
by hemorrhage from the waist down the barricade had protected the
basque and nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages nicolette
sewed them basque rolled them as lint was lacking the doctor for
the time being arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding beside
the bed three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical
instruments lay spread out the doctor bathed marius face and hair with
cold water a full pail was reddened in an instant the porter candle
the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly from time to time he made a
negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which
a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor
at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius face and lightly
touching his still closed eyes with his finger a door opened at the end
of the drawing room and a long pallid figure made its appearance
the revolt had for the past two days deeply agitated enraged and
engrossed the mind of m gillenormand he had not been able to sleep
on the previous night and he had been in a fever all day long in the
evening he had gone to bed very early recommending that everything in
the house should be well barred and he had fallen into a doze through
old men sleep lightly m gillenormands chamber adjoined the
drawing room and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken
the noise had awakened him surprised at the rift of light which he
saw under his door he had risen from his bed and had groped his way
he stood astonished on the threshold one hand on the handle of the
half open door with his head bent a little forward and quivering
his body wrapped in a white dressing gown which was straight and as
destitute of folds as a winding sheet and he had the air of a phantom
he saw the bed and on the mattress that young man bleeding white with
a waxen whiteness with closed eyes and gaping mouth and pallid lips
stripped to the waist slashed all over with crimson wounds motionless
the grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified
limbs can tremble his eyes whose corneae were yellow on account of
his great age were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter his whole
face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull his arms fell
pendent as though a spring had broken and his amazement was betrayed
by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands which quivered
all over his knees formed an angle in front allowing through
the opening in his dressing gown a view of his poor bare legs all
sir said basque monsieur has just been brought back he went to the
he is dead cried the old man in a terrible voice ah the rascal
then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this
sir said he you are the doctor begin by telling me one thing he
the doctor who was at the highest pitch of anxiety remained silent
m gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter
he is dead he is dead he is dead he has got himself killed on
the barricades out of hatred to me he did that to spite me ah you
blood drinker this is the way he returns to me misery of my life he
he went to the window threw it wide open as though he were stifling
and erect before the darkness he began to talk into the street to the
pierced sabred exterminated slashed hacked in pieces just look at
that the villain he knew well that i was waiting for him and that i
had had his room arranged and that i had placed at the head of my bed
his portrait taken when he was a little child he knew well that he had
only to come back and that i had been recalling him for years and that
i remained by my fireside with my hands on my knees not knowing what
to do and that i was mad over it you knew well that you had but to
return and to say it is i and you would have been the master of the
house and that i should have obeyed you and that you could have done
whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather you knew
no he is a royalist i will not go and you went to the barricades
and you got yourself killed out of malice to revenge yourself for what
i said to you about monsieur le duc de berry it is infamous go to bed
then and sleep tranquilly he is dead and this is my awakening
the doctor who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters quitted
marius for a moment went to m gillenormand and took his arm
the grandfather turned round gazed at him with eyes which seemed
exaggerated in size and bloodshot and said to him calmly
i thank you sir i am composed i am a man i witnessed the death of
louis xvi i know how to bear events one thing is terrible and that is
to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief you will
progress enlightenment the rights of man the liberty of the press
and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you ah
marius it is abominable killed dead before me a barricade ah the
scamp doctor you live in this quarter i believe oh i know you well
i see your cabriolet pass my window i am going to tell you you are
wrong to think that i am angry one does not fly into a rage against a
dead man that would be stupid this is a child whom i have reared
i was already old while he was very young he played in the tuileries
garden with his little shovel and his little chair and in order that
the inspectors might not grumble i stopped up the holes that he made in
the earth with his shovel with my cane one day he exclaimed down with
louis xviii and off he went it was no fault of mine he was all rosy
and blond his mother is dead have you ever noticed that all little
children are blond why is it so he is the son of one of those brigands
of the loire but children are innocent of their fathers crimes
i remember when he was no higher than that he could not manage
to pronounce his ds he had a way of talking that was so sweet and
indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping i
remember that once in front of the hercules farnese people formed a
circle to admire him and marvel at him he was so handsome was that
child he had a head such as you see in pictures i talked in a deep
voice and i frightened him with my cane but he knew very well that it
was only to make him laugh in the morning when he entered my room i
grumbled but he was like the sunlight to me all the same one cannot
defend oneself against those brats they take hold of you they hold you
fast they never let you go again the truth is that there never was a
cupid like that child now what can you say for your lafayettes your
benjamin constants and your tirecuir de corcelles who have killed him
this cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion
he approached marius who still lay livid and motionless and to whom
the physician had returned and began once more to wring his hands the
old mans pallid lips moved as though mechanically and permitted the
passage of words that were barely audible like breaths in the death
ah heartless lad ah clubbist ah wretch ah septembrist
reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man addressed to a corpse
little by little as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions
should come to the light the sequence of words returned but the
grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them his
voice was so weak and extinct that it seemed to come from the other
it is all the same to me i am going to die too that i am and
to think that there is not a hussy in paris who would not have been
delighted to make this wretch happy a scamp who instead of amusing
himself and enjoying life went off to fight and get himself shot down
like a brute and for whom why for the republic instead of going to
dance at the chaumiere as it is the duty of young folks to do whats
the use of being twenty years old the republic a cursed pretty folly
poor mothers beget fine boys do come he is dead that will make two
funerals under the same carriage gate so you have got yourself arranged
like this for the sake of general lamarques handsome eyes what had
that general lamarque done to you a slasher a chatter box to get
oneself killed for a dead man if that isnt enough to drive any one
mad just think of it at twenty and without so much as turning his
head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him thats the
way poor good old fellows are forced to die alone now adays perish
in your corner owl well after all so much the better that is what
i was hoping for this will kill me on the spot i am too old i am
a hundred years old i am a hundred thousand years old i ought by
rights to have been dead long ago this blow puts an end to it so all
is over what happiness what is the good of making him inhale ammonia
and all that parcel of drugs you are wasting your trouble you fool of
a doctor come hes dead completely dead i know all about it i
am dead myself too he hasnt done things by half yes this age is
infamous infamous and thats what i think of you of your ideas of
your systems of your masters of your oracles of your doctors of your
scape graces of writers of your rascally philosophers and of all the
revolutions which for the last sixty years have been frightening
the flocks of crows in the tuileries but you were pitiless in getting
yourself killed like this i shall not even grieve over your death do
at that moment marius slowly opened his eyes and his glance still
dimmed by lethargic wonder rested on m gillenormand
marius cried the old man marius my little marius my child my
well beloved son you open your eyes you gaze upon me you are alive
javert passed slowly down the rue de lhomme arme
he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and
likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his
up to that day javert had borrowed from napoleons attitudes only that
which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest
that which is expressive of uncertainty with the hands behind the
back had been unknown to him now a change had taken place his whole
person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety
he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes
skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from
the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the pont notre dame
there between the notre dame and the pont au change on the one hand
and the quai de la megisserie and the quai aux fleurs on the other the
seine forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid
this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners nothing is more
dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by
the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished the two bridges
situated thus close together augment the peril the water hurries in
formidable wise through the arches it rolls in vast and terrible waves
it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the
bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes
men who fall in there never re appear the best of swimmers are drowned
javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both
hands and while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of
a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the
depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself
for several hours javert had ceased to be simple he was troubled
that brain so limpid in its blindness had lost its transparency that
crystal was clouded javert felt duty divided within his conscience and
he could not conceal the fact from himself when he had so unexpectedly
encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in
him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and of the
he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld
two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known
more than one straight line and the poignant anguish lay in this that
the two paths were contrary to each other one of these straight lines
excluded the other which of the two was the true one
to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to
be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to
repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him
go and to say to the latter in his turn be free to sacrifice to
personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious
in those personal motives of something that was also general and
perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his
conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should
accumulate upon him this was what overwhelmed him
one thing had amazed him this was that jean valjean should have done
him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have
where did he stand he sought to comprehend his position and could no
what was he to do now to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean
valjean at liberty was bad in the first case the man of authority fell
lower than the man of the galleys in the second a convict rose above
the law and set his foot upon it in both cases dishonor for him
javert there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive
destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the
impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice
one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think the very
violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it thought was
something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful
in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion
and it irritated him to have that within him
thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his
functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue
thought on the day which had just passed was a torture nevertheless it
was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after
such shocks and render to himself an account of himself
what he had just done made him shudder he javert had seen fit to
decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the
whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code
upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs
for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable every time
that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which
he had committed he trembled from head to foot upon what should he
decide one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to
the rue de lhomme arme and commit jean valjean to prison it was clear
that that was what he ought to do he could not
something what is there in the world anything outside of the
tribunals executory sentences the police and the authorities javert
a galley slave sacred a convict who could not be touched by the law
was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to
proceed with vigor the man made to submit that these two men who were
both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both
of them had set themselves above the law what then such enormities
were to happen and no one was to be punished jean valjean stronger
than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert
was to go on eating the governments bread
he might athwart this revery have also reproached himself on
the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des
filles du calvaire but he never even thought of that the lesser fault
was lost in the greater besides that insurgent was obviously a dead
man and legally death puts an end to pursuit
jean valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit
jean valjean disconcerted him all the axioms which had served him as
points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence
of this man jean valjeans generosity towards him javert crushed him
other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated
as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities m madeleine
re appeared behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in
such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable javert
felt that something terrible was penetrating his soul admiration for
a convict respect for a galley slave is that a possible thing he
shuddered at it yet could not escape from it in vain did he struggle
he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that
a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict
returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity
to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy
saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more
nearly akin to an angel than to a man javert was constrained to admit
things could not go on in this manner
certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without
resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous
hero who enraged almost as much as he amazed him twenty times as he
sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had
roared within him a score of times he had been tempted to fling himself
upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to
arrest him what more simple in fact to cry out at the first post that
they passed here is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban
to summon the gendarmes and say to them this man is yours then to
go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to
meddle further in the matter this man is forever a prisoner of the law
the law may do with him what it will what could be more just javert
had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to
apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do
it and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards
jean valjeans collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an
enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice
a strange voice crying to him it is well deliver up your savior
then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your claws
then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean
but then why had he permitted that man to leave him alive he had
the right to be killed in that barricade he should have asserted that
right it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his
succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force
his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty he felt that he had been
uprooted the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand
he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species there had taken
place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal
affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto to remain in his
former uprightness did not suffice a whole order of unexpected facts
had cropped up and subjugated him a whole new world was dawning on
his soul kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence
violences committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more
definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear
in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god
running in inverse sense to justice according to men he perceived amid
the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun it horrified
and dazzled him an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle
he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases
that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might
be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not
be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled
obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue
of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and
he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified
he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist this convict had
been good and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been
he found that he was a coward he conceived a horror of himself
javerts ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was
how had he come to such a pass how had all this happened he could not
have told himself he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of
all that he could do he could not contrive to explain it to himself
he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean
valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which
he javert was the slave not for a single instant while he held him
in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of
releasing him it was in some sort without his consciousness that his
hand had relaxed and had let him go free
all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes he put
questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies
frightened him he asked himself what has that convict done that
desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has
had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who
owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in
showing mercy upon me his duty no something more and i in showing
mercy upon him in my turn what have i done my duty no something
more so there is something beyond duty here he took fright his
balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the
other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which
was on high than by the one which was below without being in the least
in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher or incredulous
being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established
church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order
was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to mans
estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his
religion in the police being and here we employ words without the
least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have
said a spy as other men are priests he had a superior m gisquet up
to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god
this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt
embarrassed by him this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings
he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant
of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow that he must
not disobey nor find fault nor discuss and that in the presence of a
superior who amazes him too greatly the inferior has no other resource
but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to god
however things might stand and it was to this point that he reverted
constantly one fact dominated everything else for him and that was
that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law he had just
shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban he had just
set a galley slave at large he had just robbed the laws of a man who
belonged to them that was what he had done he no longer understood
himself the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo
was left with him up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith
which gloomy probity engenders this faith had quitted him this probity
had deserted him all that he had believed in melted away truths which
he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably henceforth
he must be a different man he was suffering from the strange pains of
a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract he saw that which
it was repugnant to him to behold he felt himself emptied useless put
out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved authority was
dead within him he had no longer any reason for existing
to be granite and to doubt to be the statue of chastisement cast in one
piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact
that one cherishes beneath ones breast of bronze something absurd
and disobedient which almost resembles a heart to come to the pass of
returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day
that that good is evil to be the watch dog and to lick the intruders
hand to be ice and melt to be the pincers and to turn into a hand
to suddenly feel ones fingers opening to relax ones grip what a
the man projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating
to be obliged to confess this to oneself infallibility is not
infallible there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said
when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated
with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but
men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake to behold a rift in
that which was passing in javert was the fampoux of a rectilinear
conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which
had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking
against god it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that
the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its
rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light that the immovable
the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect
could bend that there should exist for the locomotive a road to
god always within man and refractory he the true conscience to the
false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the ray to
remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable
absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute humanity
