without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary
sonnets epigrams and eulogies such as are commonly put at the
beginning of books for i can tell thee though composing it cost me some
labour i found none greater than the making of this preface thou art now
reading many times did i take up my pen to write it and many did i lay
it down again not knowing what to write one of these times as i was
pondering with the paper before me a pen in my ear my elbow on the
desk and my cheek in my hand thinking of what i should say there came
in unexpectedly a certain lively clever friend of mine who seeing me
so deep in thought asked the reason to which i making no mystery of
it answered that i was thinking of the preface i had to make for the
story of don quixote which so troubled me that i had a mind not to
make any at all nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight
for how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient
lawgiver they call the public will say when it sees me after slumbering
so many years in the silence of oblivion coming out now with all my
years upon my back and with a book as dry as a rush devoid of
invention meagre in style poor in thoughts wholly wanting in learning
and wisdom without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end
after the fashion of other books i see which though all fables and
profanity are so full of maxims from aristotle and plato and the whole
herd of philosophers that they fill the readers with amazement and
convince them that the authors are men of learning erudition and
eloquence and then when they quote the holy scriptures anyone would
say they are st thomases or other doctors of the church observing as
they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a
distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it
is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read of all this there will be
nothing in my book for i have nothing to quote in the margin or to note
at the end and still less do i know what authors i follow in it to
place them at the beginning as all do under the letters a b c
beginning with aristotle and ending with xenophon or zoilus or zeuxis
though one was a slanderer and the other a painter also my book must do
without sonnets at the beginning at least sonnets whose authors are
dukes marquises counts bishops ladies or famous poets though if i
were to ask two or three obliging friends i know they would give me
them and such as the productions of those that have the highest
in short my friend i continued i am determined that senor don
quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own la mancha until
heaven provide some one to garnish him with all those things he stands in
need of because i find myself through my shallowness and want of
learning unequal to supplying them and because i am by nature shy and
careless about hunting for authors to say what i myself can say without
them hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in and reason
hearing this my friend giving himself a slap on the forehead and
breaking into a hearty laugh exclaimed before god brother now am i
disabused of an error in which i have been living all this long time i
have known you all through which i have taken you to be shrewd and
sensible in all you do but now i see you are as far from that as the
heaven is from the earth it is possible that things of so little moment
and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours
fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles by my faith this
comes not of any want of ability but of too much indolence and too
little knowledge of life do you want to know if i am telling the truth
well then attend to me and you will see how in the opening and
shutting of an eye i sweep away all your difficulties and supply all
those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing
before the world the story of your famous don quixote the light and
say on said i listening to his talk how do you propose to make up
for my diffidence and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity i am in
to which he made answer your first difficulty about the sonnets
epigrams or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning and
which ought to be by persons of importance and rank can be removed if
you yourself take a little trouble to make them you can afterwards
baptise them and put any name you like to them fathering them on
prester john of the indies or the emperor of trebizond who to my
knowledge were said to have been famous poets and even if they were
not and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the
fact never care two maravedis for that for even if they prove a lie
against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with
as to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you
take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story it is only
contriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of latin you may
happen to have by heart or at any rate that will not give you much
trouble to look up so as when you speak of freedom and captivity to
and then refer in the margin to horace or whoever said it or if you
allude to the power of death to come in with
if it be friendship and the love god bids us bear to our enemy go at
once to the holy scriptures which you can do with a very small amount of
research and quote no less than the words of god himself ego autem dico
vobis diligite inimicos vestros if you speak of evil thoughts turn to
the gospel de corde exeunt cogitationes malae if of the fickleness of
friends there is cato who will give you his distich
with these and such like bits of latin they will take you for a
grammarian at all events and that now a days is no small honour and
with regard to adding annotations at the end of the book you may safely
do it in this way if you mention any giant in your book contrive that it
shall be the giant goliath and with this alone which will cost you
almost nothing you have a grand note for you can put the giant golias
or goliath was a philistine whom the shepherd david slew by a mighty
stone cast in the terebinth valley as is related in the book of
kings in the chapter where you find it written
next to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and
cosmography manage that the river tagus shall be named in your story
and there you are at once with another famous annotation setting
forth the river tagus was so called after a king of spain it has its
source in such and such a place and falls into the ocean kissing the
walls of the famous city of lisbon and it is a common belief that it has
golden sands etc if you should have anything to do with robbers i will
give you the story of cacus for i have it by heart if with loose women
there is the bishop of mondonedo who will give you the loan of lamia
laida and flora any reference to whom will bring you great credit if
with hard hearted ones ovid will furnish you with medea if with witches
or enchantresses homer has calypso and virgil circe if with valiant
captains julius caesar himself will lend you himself in his own
commentaries and plutarch will give you a thousand alexanders if you
should deal with love with two ounces you may know of tuscan you can go
to leon the hebrew who will supply you to your hearts content or if
you should not care to go to foreign countries you have at home fonsecas
of the love of god in which is condensed all that you or the most
imaginative mind can want on the subject in short all you have to do is
to manage to quote these names or refer to these stories i have
mentioned and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations
and i swear by all thats good to fill your margins and use up four
now let us come to those references to authors which other books have
and you want for yours the remedy for this is very simple you have only
to look out for some book that quotes them all from a to z as you say
yourself and then insert the very same alphabet in your book and though
the imposition may be plain to see because you have so little need to
borrow from them that is no matter there will probably be some simple
enough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain
artless story of yours at any rate if it answers no other purpose this
long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of
authority to your book besides no one will trouble himself to verify
whether you have followed them or whether you have not being no way
concerned in it especially as if i mistake not this book of yours has
no need of any one of those things you say it wants for it is from
beginning to end an attack upon the books of chivalry of which
aristotle never dreamt nor st basil said a word nor cicero had any
knowledge nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology
come within the range of its fanciful vagaries nor have geometrical
measurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to
do with it nor does it mean to preach to anybody mixing up things human
and divine a sort of motley in which no christian understanding should
dress itself it has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its
composition and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will
be and as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the
authority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world and
with the public there is no need for you to go a begging for aphorisms
from philosophers precepts from holy scripture fables from poets
speeches from orators or miracles from saints but merely to take care
that your style and diction run musically pleasantly and plainly with
clear proper and well placed words setting forth your purpose to the
best of your power and putting your ideas intelligibly without
confusion or obscurity strive too that in reading your story the
melancholy may be moved to laughter and the merry made merrier still
that the simple shall not be wearied that the judicious shall admire the
invention that the grave shall not despise it nor the wise fail to
praise it finally keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that
ill founded edifice of the books of chivalry hated by some and praised
by many more for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small
in profound silence i listened to what my friend said and his
observations made such an impression on me that without attempting to
question them i admitted their soundness and out of them i determined
to make this preface wherein gentle reader thou wilt perceive my
friends good sense my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a
time of need and what thou hast gained in receiving without addition or
alteration the story of the famous don quixote of la mancha who is held
by all the inhabitants of the district of the campo de montiel to have
been the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many years
been seen in that neighbourhood i have no desire to magnify the service
i render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a
knight but i do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make
with the famous sancho panza his squire in whom to my thinking i have
given thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scattered
through the swarm of the vain books of chivalry and so may god give
to the duke of bejar marquis of gibraleon count of benalcazar and
banares vicecount of the puebla de alcocer master of the towns of
in belief of the good reception and honours that your excellency bestows
on all sort of books as prince so inclined to favor good arts chiefly
those who by their nobleness do not submit to the service and bribery of
the vulgar i have determined bringing to light the ingenious gentleman
don quixote of la mancha in shelter of your excellencys glamorous name
to whom with the obeisance i owe to such grandeur i pray to receive it
agreeably under his protection so that in this shadow though deprived
of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works
composed in the houses of those who know it dares appear with assurance
in the judgment of some who trespassing the bounds of their own
ignorance use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings
of others it is my earnest hope that your excellencys good counsel in
regard to my honourable purpose will not disdain the littleness of so
which treats of the character and pursuits of the famous gentleman don
in a village of la mancha the name of which i have no desire to call to
mind there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance rack an old buckler a lean hack and a greyhound for
coursing an olla of rather more beef than mutton a salad on most
nights scraps on saturdays lentils on fridays and a pigeon or so extra
on sundays made away with three quarters of his income the rest of it
went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match
for holidays while on week days he made a brave figure in his best
homespun he had in his house a housekeeper past forty a niece under
twenty and a lad for the field and market place who used to saddle the
hack as well as handle the bill hook the age of this gentleman of ours
was bordering on fifty he was of a hardy habit spare gaunt featured a
very early riser and a great sportsman they will have it his surname was
quixada or quesada for here there is some difference of opinion among
the authors who write on the subject although from reasonable
conjectures it seems plain that he was called quexana this however is
of but little importance to our tale it will be enough not to stray a
hairs breadth from the truth in the telling of it
you must know then that the above named gentleman whenever he was at
leisure which was mostly all the year round gave himself up to reading
books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely
neglected the pursuit of his field sports and even the management of his
property and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that
he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read and
brought home as many of them as he could get but of all there were none
he liked so well as those of the famous feliciano de silvas composition
for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in
his sight particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and
cartels where he often found passages like the reason of the unreason
with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason i
murmur at your beauty or again the high heavens that of your
divinity divinely fortify you with the stars render you deserving of the
desert your greatness deserves over conceits of this sort the poor
gentleman lost his wits and used to lie awake striving to understand
them and worm the meaning out of them what aristotle himself could not
have made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special
purpose he was not at all easy about the wounds which don belianis gave
and took because it seemed to him that great as were the surgeons who
had cured him he must have had his face and body covered all over with
seams and scars he commended however the authors way of ending his
book with the promise of that interminable adventure and many a time was
he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there
proposed which no doubt he would have done and made a successful piece
of work of it too had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented
many an argument did he have with the curate of his village a learned
man and a graduate of siguenza as to which had been the better knight
palmerin of england or amadis of gaul master nicholas the village
barber however used to say that neither of them came up to the knight
of phoebus and that if there was any that could compare with him it was
don galaor the brother of amadis of gaul because he had a spirit that
was equal to every occasion and was no finikin knight nor lachrymose
like his brother while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind
him in short he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his
nights from sunset to sunrise and his days from dawn to dark poring
over them and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so
dry that he lost his wits his fancy grew full of what he used to read
about in his books enchantments quarrels battles challenges wounds
wooings loves agonies and all sorts of impossible nonsense and it so
possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read
of was true that to him no history in the world had more reality in it
he used to say the cid ruy diaz was a very good knight but that he was
not to be compared with the knight of the burning sword who with one
back stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants he thought more
of bernardo del carpio because at roncesvalles he slew roland in spite of
enchantments availing himself of the artifice of hercules when he
strangled antaeus the son of terra in his arms he approved highly of the
giant morgante because although of the giant breed which is always
arrogant and ill conditioned he alone was affable and well bred but
above all he admired reinaldos of montalban especially when he saw him
sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met and when
beyond the seas he stole that image of mahomet which as his history
says was entirely of gold to have a bout of kicking at that traitor of
a ganelon he would have given his housekeeper and his niece into the
in short his wits being quite gone he hit upon the strangest notion
that ever madman in this world hit upon and that was that he fancied it
was right and requisite as well for the support of his own honour as for
the service of his country that he should make a knight errant of
himself roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest
of adventures and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as
being the usual practices of knights errant righting every kind of
wrong and exposing himself to peril and danger from which in the issue
he was to reap eternal renown and fame already the poor man saw himself
crowned by the might of his arm emperor of trebizond at least and so
led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies he
set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution
the first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to
his great grandfather and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner
eaten with rust and covered with mildew he scoured and polished it as
best he could but he perceived one great defect in it that it had no
closed helmet nothing but a simple morion this deficiency however his
ingenuity supplied for he contrived a kind of half helmet of pasteboard
which fitted on to the morion looked like a whole one it is true that
in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut he drew his
sword and gave it a couple of slashes the first of which undid in an
instant what had taken him a week to do the ease with which he had
knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat and to guard against that
danger he set to work again fixing bars of iron on the inside until he
was satisfied with its strength and then not caring to try any more
experiments with it he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most
he next proceeded to inspect his hack which with more quartos than a
real and more blemishes than the steed of gonela that tantum pellis et
ossa fuit surpassed in his eyes the bucephalus of alexander or the
babieca of the cid four days were spent in thinking what name to give
him because as he said to himself it was not right that a horse
belonging to a knight so famous and one with such merits of his own
should be without some distinctive name and he strove to adapt it so as
to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight errant and
what he then was for it was only reasonable that his master taking a
new character he should take a new name and that it should be a
distinguished and full sounding one befitting the new order and calling
he was about to follow and so after having composed struck out
rejected added to unmade and remade a multitude of names out of his
memory and fancy he decided upon calling him rocinante a name to his
thinking lofty sonorous and significant of his condition as a hack
before he became what he now was the first and foremost of all the hacks
having got a name for his horse so much to his taste he was anxious to
get one for himself and he was eight days more pondering over this
point till at last he made up his mind to call himself don quixote
whence as has been already said the authors of this veracious history
have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt quixada and
not quesada as others would have it recollecting however that the
valiant amadis was not content to call himself curtly amadis and nothing
more but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous
and called himself amadis of gaul he like a good knight resolved to
add on the name of his and to style himself don quixote of la mancha
whereby he considered he described accurately his origin and country
and did honour to it in taking his surname from it
so then his armour being furbished his morion turned into a helmet his
hack christened and he himself confirmed he came to the conclusion that
nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love
with for a knight errant without love was like a tree without leaves or
fruit or a body without a soul as he said to himself if for my sins
or by my good fortune i come across some giant hereabouts a common
occurrence with knights errant and overthrow him in one onslaught or
cleave him asunder to the waist or in short vanquish and subdue him
will it not be well to have some one i may send him to as a present that
he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady and in a
humble submissive voice say i am the giant caraculiambro lord of the
island of malindrania vanquished in single combat by the never
sufficiently extolled knight don quixote of la mancha who has commanded
me to present myself before your grace that your highness dispose of me
at your pleasure oh how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of
this speech especially when he had thought of some one to call his lady
there was so the story goes in a village near his own a very
good looking farm girl with whom he had been at one time in love though
so far as is known she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter
her name was aldonza lorenzo and upon her he thought fit to confer the
title of lady of his thoughts and after some search for a name which
should not be out of harmony with her own and should suggest and
indicate that of a princess and great lady he decided upon calling her
dulcinea del toboso she being of el toboso a name to his mind
musical uncommon and significant like all those he had already
bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him
which treats of the first sally the ingenious don quixote made from home
these preliminaries settled he did not care to put off any longer the
execution of his design urged on to it by the thought of all the world
was losing by his delay seeing what wrongs he intended to right
grievances to redress injustices to repair abuses to remove and duties
to discharge so without giving notice of his intention to anyone and
without anybody seeing him one morning before the dawning of the day
which was one of the hottest of the month of july he donned his suit of
armour mounted rocinante with his patched up helmet on braced his
buckler took his lance and by the back door of the yard sallied forth
upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with
what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose but scarcely
did he find himself upon the open plain when a terrible thought struck
him one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very
outset it occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight and that
according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms
against any knight and that even if he had been still he ought as a
novice knight to wear white armour without a device upon the shield
until by his prowess he had earned one these reflections made him waver
in his purpose but his craze being stronger than any reasoning he made
up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came
across following the example of others in the same case as he had read
in the books that brought him to this pass as for white armour he
resolved on the first opportunity to scour his until it was whiter than
an ermine and so comforting himself he pursued his way taking that
which his horse chose for in this he believed lay the essence of
thus setting out our new fledged adventurer paced along talking to
himself and saying who knows but that in time to come when the
veracious history of my famous deeds is made known the sage who writes
it when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning will do
it after this fashion scarce had the rubicund apollo spread oer the
face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair
scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to
hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy dawn
that deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse was appearing to
mortals at the gates and balconies of the manchegan horizon when the
renowned knight don quixote of la mancha quitting the lazy down mounted
his celebrated steed rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and
famous campo de montiel which in fact he was actually traversing
happy the age happy the time he continued in which shall be made
known my deeds of fame worthy to be moulded in brass carved in marble
limned in pictures for a memorial for ever and thou o sage magician
whoever thou art to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this
wondrous history forget not i entreat thee my good rocinante the
constant companion of my ways and wanderings presently he broke out
again as if he were love stricken in earnest o princess dulcinea lady
of this captive heart a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me
forth with scorn and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the
presence of thy beauty o lady deign to hold in remembrance this heart
thy vassal that thus in anguish pines for love of thee
so he went on stringing together these and other absurdities all in the
style of those his books had taught him imitating their language as well
as he could and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so
rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he
had any nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable
happening to him at which he was in despair for he was anxious to
encounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm
writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of
puerto lapice others say it was that of the windmills but what i have
ascertained on this point and what i have found written in the annals of
la mancha is that he was on the road all day and towards nightfall his
hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry when looking all
around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherds shanty where
he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants he perceived not far
out of his road an inn which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the
portals if not the palaces of his redemption and quickening his pace
he reached it just as night was setting in at the door were standing two
young women girls of the district as they call them on their way to
seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn
and as happen what might to our adventurer everything he saw or imaged
seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of
the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its
four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver not forgetting the
drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of
the sort to this inn which to him seemed a castle he advanced and at
a short distance from it he checked rocinante hoping that some dwarf
would show himself upon the battlements and by sound of trumpet give
notice that a knight was approaching the castle but seeing that they
were slow about it and that rocinante was in a hurry to reach the
stable he made for the inn door and perceived the two gay damsels who
were standing there and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or
lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate
at this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the
stubbles collecting a drove of pigs for without any apology that is
what they are called gave a blast of his horn to bring them together
and forthwith it seemed to don quixote to be what he was expecting the
signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival and so with prodigious
satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies who seeing a man
of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler were
turning in dismay into the inn when don quixote guessing their fear by
their flight raising his pasteboard visor disclosed his dry dusty
visage and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them your
ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness for that it belongs not to
the order of knighthood which i profess to offer to anyone much less to
highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be the girls were
looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which
the clumsy visor obscured but when they heard themselves called maidens
a thing so much out of their line they could not restrain their
laughter which made don quixote wax indignant and say modesty becomes
the fair and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness
this however i say not to pain or anger you for my desire is none
the incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier
only increased the ladies laughter and that increased his irritation
and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had
not come out who being a very fat man was a very peaceful one he
seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more
than his saddle bridle lance buckler or corselet was not at all
indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement but
in truth standing in awe of such a complicated armament he thought it
best to speak him fairly so he said senor caballero if your worship
wants lodging bating the bed for there is not one in the inn there is
plenty of everything else here don quixote observing the respectful
bearing of the alcaide of the fortress for so innkeeper and inn seemed
in his eyes made answer sir castellan for me anything will suffice
the host fancied he called him castellan because he took him for a
worthy of castile though he was in fact an andalusian and one from
the strand of san lucar as crafty a thief as cacus and as full of tricks
as a student or a page in that case said he
and if so you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of
sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth not to say for a single
night so saying he advanced to hold the stirrup for don quixote who
got down with great difficulty and exertion for he had not broken his
fast all day and then charged the host to take great care of his horse
as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world the
landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as don quixote said
nor even half as good and putting him up in the stable he returned to
see what might be wanted by his guest whom the damsels who had by this
time made their peace with him were now relieving of his armour they
had taken off his breastplate and backpiece but they neither knew nor
saw how to open his gorget or remove his make shift helmet for he had
fastened it with green ribbons which as there was no untying the knots
required to be cut this however he would not by any means consent to
so he remained all the evening with his helmet on the drollest and
oddest figure that can be imagined and while they were removing his
armour taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree
belonging to the castle he said to them with great sprightliness
or rocinante for that ladies mine is my horses name and don quixote
of la mancha is my own for though i had no intention of declaring myself
until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known the
necessity of adapting that old ballad of lancelot to the present occasion
has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely a time
however will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey and then
the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you
the girls who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort had
nothing to say in reply they only asked him if he wanted anything to
eat i would gladly eat a bit of something said don quixote for i
feel it would come very seasonably the day happened to be a friday and
in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call
in castile abadejo in andalusia bacallao and in some places
curadillo and in others troutlet so they asked him if he thought he
could eat troutlet for there was no other fish to give him if there be
troutlets enough said don quixote they will be the same thing as a
trout for it is all one to me whether i am given eight reals in small
change or a piece of eight moreover it may be that these troutlets are
like veal which is better than beef or kid which is better than goat
but whatever it be let it come quickly for the burden and pressure of
arms cannot be borne without support to the inside they laid a table
for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air and the host
brought him a portion of ill soaked and worse cooked stockfish and a
piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour but a laughable
sight it was to see him eating for having his helmet on and the beaver
up he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless
some one else placed it there and this service one of the ladies
rendered him but to give him anything to drink was impossible or would
have been so had not the landlord bored a reed and putting one end in
his mouth poured the wine into him through the other all which he bore
with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet
while this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder who as he
approached sounded his reed pipe four or five times and thereby
completely convinced don quixote that he was in some famous castle and
that they were regaling him with music and that the stockfish was trout
the bread the whitest the wenches ladies and the landlord the castellan
of the castle and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had
been to some purpose but still it distressed him to think he had not
been dubbed a knight for it was plain to him he could not lawfully
engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood
wherein is related the droll way in which don quixote had himself dubbed
harassed by this reflection he made haste with his scanty pothouse
supper and having finished it called the landlord and shutting himself
into the stable with him fell on his knees before him saying from
this spot i rise not valiant knight until your courtesy grants me the
boon i seek one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the
human race the landlord seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a
speech of this kind stood staring at him in bewilderment not knowing
what to do or say and entreating him to rise but all to no purpose
until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him i looked for no
less my lord from your high magnificence replied don quixote and i
have to tell you that the boon i have asked and your liberality has
granted is that you shall dub me knight to morrow morning and that
to night i shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle thus
tomorrow as i have said will be accomplished what i so much desire
enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world
seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress as is the duty of
chivalry and of knights errant like myself whose ambition is directed to
the landlord who as has been mentioned was something of a wag and had
already some suspicion of his guests want of wits was quite convinced
of it on hearing talk of this kind from him and to make sport for the
night he determined to fall in with his humour so he told him he was
quite right in pursuing the object he had in view and that such a motive
was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and
his gallant bearing showed him to be and that he himself in his younger
days had followed the same honourable calling roaming in quest of
adventures in various parts of the world among others the curing grounds
of malaga the isles of riaran the precinct of seville the little
market of segovia the olivera of valencia the rondilla of granada the
strand of san lucar the colt of cordova the taverns of toledo and
divers other quarters where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and
the lightness of his fingers doing many wrongs cheating many widows
ruining maids and swindling minors and in short bringing himself under
the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in spain until
at last he had retired to this castle of his where he was living upon
his property and upon that of others and where he received all
knights errant of whatever rank or condition they might be all for the
great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with
him in return for his benevolence he told him moreover that in this
castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour as
it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt but that in a case of
necessity it might he knew be watched anywhere and he might watch it
that night in a courtyard of the castle and in the morning god willing
the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a
knight and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so he asked
if he had any money with him to which don quixote replied that he had
not a farthing as in the histories of knights errant he had never read
of any of them carrying any on this point the landlord told him he was
mistaken for though not recorded in the histories because in the
authors opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and
necessary as money and clean shirts it was not to be supposed therefore
that they did not carry them and he might regard it as certain and
established that all knights errant about whom there were so many full
and unimpeachable books carried well furnished purses in case of
emergency and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to
cure the wounds they received for in those plains and deserts where they
engaged in combat and came out wounded it was not always that there was
some one to cure them unless indeed they had for a friend some sage
magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud
some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting
one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant
and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever but in
case this should not occur the knights of old took care to see that
their squires were provided with money and other requisites such as lint
and ointments for healing purposes and when it happened that knights had
no squires which was rarely and seldom the case they themselves carried
everything in cunning saddle bags that were hardly seen on the horses
croup as if it were something else of more importance because unless
for some such reason carrying saddle bags was not very favourably
regarded among knights errant he therefore advised him and as his
godson so soon to be he might even command him never from that time
forth to travel without money and the usual requirements and he would
find the advantage of them when he least expected it
don quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously and it was
arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one
side of the inn so collecting it all together don quixote placed it on
a trough that stood by the side of a well and bracing his buckler on his
arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and
down in front of the trough and as he began his march night began to
the landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of
his guest the watching of the armour and the dubbing ceremony he
contemplated full of wonder at so strange a form of madness they
flocked to see it from a distance and observed with what composure he
sometimes paced up and down or sometimes leaning on his lance gazed on
his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long and as the
night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie
with his that lent it everything the novice knight did was plainly seen
meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water
his team and it was necessary to remove don quixotes armour as it lay
on the trough but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud
voice o thou whoever thou art rash knight that comest to lay hands on
the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword have a
care what thou dost touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life
as the penalty of thy rashness the carrier gave no heed to these words
and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his
health but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from
him seeing this don quixote raised his eyes to heaven and fixing his
thoughts apparently upon his lady dulcinea exclaimed aid me lady
mine in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast
which thou holdest in subjection let not thy favour and protection fail
me in this first jeopardy and with these words and others to the same
purpose dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and
with it smote such a blow on the carriers head that he stretched him on
the ground so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there
would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him this done he picked up
his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before
shortly after this another not knowing what had happened for the
carrier still lay senseless came with the same object of giving water
to his mules and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear
the trough when don quixote without uttering a word or imploring aid
from anyone once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his
lance and without actually breaking the second carriers head into
pieces made more than three of it for he laid it open in four at the
noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot and among them the
landlord seeing this don quixote braced his buckler on his arm and
with his hand on his sword exclaimed o lady of beauty strength and
support of my faint heart it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy
greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an
adventure by this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have
flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him the comrades
of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance
to shower stones on don quixote who screened himself as best he could
with his buckler not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour
unprotected the landlord shouted to them to leave him alone for he had
already told them that he was mad and as a madman he would not be
accountable even if he killed them all still louder shouted don quixote
calling them knaves and traitors and the lord of the castle who allowed
knights errant to be treated in this fashion a villain and a low born
knight whom had he received the order of knighthood he would call to
account for his treachery but of you he cried base and vile rabble
i make no account fling strike come on do all ye can against me ye
shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be this he
uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants
with a terrible fear and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of
the landlord they left off stoning him and he allowed them to carry off
the wounded and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed
but these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the
landlord so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at
once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure
could occur so going up to him he apologised for the rudeness which
without his knowledge had been offered to him by these low people who
however had been well punished for their audacity as he had already
told him he said there was no chapel in the castle nor was it needed
for what remained to be done for as he understood the ceremonial of the
order the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and
in the slap on the shoulder and that could be administered in the middle
of a field and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching
the armour for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours
only while he had been more than four about it don quixote believed it
all and told him he stood there ready to obey him and to make an end of
it with as much despatch as possible for if he were again attacked and
felt himself to be dubbed knight he would not he thought leave a soul
alive in the castle except such as out of respect he might spare at his
thus warned and menaced the castellan forthwith brought out a book in
which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the
carriers and with a lad carrying a candle end and the two damsels
already mentioned he returned to where don quixote stood and bade him
kneel down then reading from his account book as if he were repeating
some devout prayer in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and
gave him a sturdy blow on the neck and then with his own sword a smart
slap on the shoulder all the while muttering between his teeth as if he
was saying his prayers having done this he directed one of the ladies
to gird on his sword which she did with great self possession and
gravity and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at
each stage of the ceremony but what they had already seen of the novice
knights prowess kept their laughter within bounds on girding him with
the sword the worthy lady said to him may god make your worship a very
fortunate knight and grant you success in battle don quixote asked her
name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was
beholden for the favour he had received as he meant to confer upon her
some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm she
answered with great humility that she was called la tolosa and that she
was the daughter of a cobbler of toledo who lived in the stalls of
sanchobienaya and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem
him as her lord don quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour
if thenceforward she assumed the don and called herself dona tolosa
she promised she would and then the other buckled on his spur and with
her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword
he asked her name and she said it was la molinera and that she was the
daughter of a respectable miller of antequera and of her likewise don
quixote requested that she would adopt the don and call herself dona
molinera making offers to her further services and favours
having thus with hot haste and speed brought to a conclusion these
never till now seen ceremonies don quixote was on thorns until he saw
himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures and saddling
rocinante at once he mounted and embracing his host as he returned
thanks for his kindness in knighting him he addressed him in language so
extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it
the landlord to get him out of the inn replied with no less rhetoric
though with shorter words and without calling upon him to pay the
of what happened to our knight when he left the inn
day was dawning when don quixote quitted the inn so happy so gay so
exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight that his joy was like
to burst his horse girths however recalling the advice of his host as
to the requisites he ought to carry with him especially that referring
to money and shirts he determined to go home and provide himself with
all and also with a squire for he reckoned upon securing a
farm labourer a neighbour of his a poor man with a family but very
well qualified for the office of squire to a knight with this object he
turned his horses head towards his village and rocinante thus reminded
of his old quarters stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to
he had not gone far when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to
come feeble cries as of some one in distress and the instant he heard
them he exclaimed thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me
that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation i
have undertaken and gathering the fruit of my ambition these cries no
doubt come from some man or woman in want of help and needing my aid
and protection and wheeling he turned rocinante in the direction
whence the cries seemed to proceed he had gone but a few paces into the
wood when he saw a mare tied to an oak and tied to another and
stripped from the waist upwards a youth of about fifteen years of age
from whom the cries came nor were they without cause for a lusty farmer
was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings
and commands repeating your mouth shut and your eyes open while the
youth made answer i wont do it again master mine by gods passion i
wont do it again and ill take more care of the flock another time
seeing what was going on don quixote said in an angry voice
discourteous knight it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend
himself mount your steed and take your lance for there was a lance
leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied and i will make you
know that you are behaving as a coward the farmer seeing before him
this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head gave
himself up for dead and made answer meekly sir knight this youth that
i am chastising is my servant employed by me to watch a flock of sheep
that i have hard by and he is so careless that i lose one every day and
when i punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says i do it out of
niggardliness to escape paying him the wages i owe him and before god
lies before me base clown said don quixote by the sun that shines
on us i have a mind to run you through with this lance pay him at once
without another word if not by the god that rules us i will make an end
of you and annihilate you on the spot release him instantly
the farmer hung his head and without a word untied his servant of whom
don quixote asked how much his master owed him
he replied nine months at seven reals a month don quixote added it up
found that it came to sixty three reals and told the farmer to pay it
down immediately if he did not want to die for it
the trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn
though he had not sworn any it was not so much for there were to be
taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him
and a real for two blood lettings when he was sick
all that is very well said don quixote but let the shoes and the
blood lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him
without any cause for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid
for you have damaged that of his body and if the barber took blood from
him when he was sick you have drawn it when he was sound so on that
the difficulty is sir knight that i have no money here let andres
come home with me and i will pay him all real by real
i go with him said the youth nay god forbid no senor not for the
world for once alone with me he would ray me like a saint bartholomew
he will do nothing of the kind said don quixote i have only to
command and he will obey me and as he has sworn to me by the order of
knighthood which he has received i leave him free and i guarantee the
consider what you are saying senor said the youth this master of
mine is not a knight nor has he received any order of knighthood for he
that matters little replied don quixote there may be haldudos
knights moreover everyone is the son of his works
that is true said andres but this master of mine of what works is
he the son when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour
i do not refuse brother andres said the farmer be good enough to
come along with me and i swear by all the orders of knighthood there are
in the world to pay you as i have agreed real by real and perfumed
for the perfumery i excuse you said don quixote give it to him in
reals and i shall be satisfied and see that you do as you have sworn
if not by the same oath i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish
you and i shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard and
if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you that you be
more firmly bound to obey it know that i am the valorous don quixote of
la mancha the undoer of wrongs and injustices and so god be with you
and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties
so saying he gave rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach the
farmer followed him with his eyes and when he saw that he had cleared
the wood and was no longer in sight he turned to his boy andres and
said come here my son i want to pay you what i owe you as that
my oath on it said andres your worship will be well advised to obey
the command of that good knight may he live a thousand years for as he
is a valiant and just judge by roque if you do not pay me he will come
my oath on it too said the farmer but as i have a strong affection
for you i want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment and
seizing him by the arm he tied him up again and gave him such a
now master andres said the farmer call on the undoer of wrongs you
will find he wont undo that though i am not sure that i have quite done
with you for i have a good mind to flay you alive but at last he
untied him and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put
andres went off rather down in the mouth swearing he would go to look
for the valiant don quixote of la mancha and tell him exactly what had
happened and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold but for all
that he went off weeping while his master stood laughing
thus did the valiant don quixote right that wrong and thoroughly
satisfied with what had taken place as he considered he had made a very
happy and noble beginning with his knighthood he took the road towards
his village in perfect self content saying in a low voice well mayest
thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth o dulcinea del
toboso fairest of the fair since it has fallen to thy lot to hold
subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned
as is and will be don quixote of la mancha who as all the world knows
yesterday received the order of knighthood and hath to day righted the
greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty
perpetrated who hath to day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder
ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child
he now came to a road branching in four directions and immediately he
was reminded of those cross roads where knights errant used to stop to
consider which road they should take in imitation of them he halted for
a while and after having deeply considered it he gave rocinante his
head submitting his own will to that of his hack who followed out his
first intention which was to make straight for his own stable after he
had gone about two miles don quixote perceived a large party of people
who as afterwards appeared were some toledo traders on their way to
buy silk at murcia there were six of them coming along under their
sunshades with four servants mounted and three muleteers on foot
scarcely had don quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that
this must be some new adventure and to help him to imitate as far as he
could those passages he had read of in his books here seemed to come one
made on purpose which he resolved to attempt so with a lofty bearing
and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups got his lance
ready brought his buckler before his breast and planting himself in the
middle of the road stood waiting the approach of these knights errant
for such he now considered and held them to be and when they had come
near enough to see and hear he exclaimed with a haughty gesture all
the world stand unless all the world confess that in all the world there
is no maiden fairer than the empress of la mancha the peerless dulcinea
the traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the
