of the others to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door and herself by
his side and begin to tell him what the castle is and how she is held
enchanted there and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the
but i will not expatiate any further upon this as it may be gathered
from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight errant one
reads it will fill the reader whoever he be with delight and wonder
and take my advice sir and as i said before read these books and you
will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your
spirits should they be depressed for myself i can say that since i have
been a knight errant i have become valiant polite generous well bred
magnanimous courteous dauntless gentle patient and have learned to
bear hardships imprisonments and enchantments and though it be such a
short time since i have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman i
hope by the might of my arm if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not
to see myself king of some kingdom where i may be able to show the
gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart for by my faith senor
the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to
anyone though he may possess it in the highest degree and gratitude
that consists of disposition only is a dead thing just as faith without
works is dead for this reason i should be glad were fortune soon to
offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor so as to show my
heart in doing good to my friends particularly to this poor sancho
panza my squire who is the best fellow in the world and i would gladly
give him a county i have promised him this ever so long only that i am
afraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm
sancho partly heard these last words of his master and said to him
strive hard you senor don quixote to give me that county so often
promised by you and so long looked for by me for i promise you there
will be no want of capacity in me to govern it and even if there is i
have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories paying so
much a year and they themselves taking charge of the government while
the lord with his legs stretched out enjoys the revenue they pay him
without troubling himself about anything else thats what ill do and
not stand haggling over trifles but wash my hands at once of the whole
business and enjoy my rents like a duke and let things go their own
that brother sancho said the canon only holds good as far as the
enjoyment of the revenue goes but the lord of the seigniory must attend
to the administration of justice and here capacity and sound judgment
come in and above all a firm determination to find out the truth for if
this be wanting in the beginning the middle and the end will always go
wrong and god as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he
i dont understand those philosophies returned sancho panza all i
know is i would i had the county as soon as i shall know how to govern
it for i have as much soul as another and as much body as anyone and i
shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his and being so i
should do as i liked and doing as i liked i should please myself and
pleasing myself i should be content and when one is content he has
nothing more to desire and when one has nothing more to desire there is
an end of it so let the county come and god he with you and let us see
one another as one blind man said to the other
that is not bad philosophy thou art talking sancho said the canon
but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of
to which don quixote returned i know not what more there is to be said
i only guide myself by the example set me by the great amadis of gaul
when he made his squire count of the insula firme and so without any
scruples of conscience i can make a count of sancho panza for he is one
of the best squires that ever knight errant had
the canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense if nonsense be
capable of method that don quixote uttered at the way in which he had
described the adventure of the knight of the lake at the impression that
the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him and lastly he
marvelled at the simplicity of sancho who desired so eagerly to obtain
by this time the canons servants who had gone to the inn to fetch the
sumpter mule had returned and making a carpet and the green grass of
the meadow serve as a table they seated themselves in the shade of some
trees and made their repast there that the carter might not be deprived
of the advantage of the spot as has been already said as they were
eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that
seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that were close
by and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat spotted all over
black white and brown spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after
it calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn
back to the fold the fugitive goat scared and frightened ran towards
the company as if seeking their protection and then stood still and the
goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if
it were possessed of reason and understanding ah wanderer wanderer
spotty spotty how have you gone limping all this time what wolves have
frightened you my daughter wont you tell me what is the matter my
beauty but what else can it be except that you are a she and cannot
keep quiet a plague on your humours and the humours of those you take
after come back come back my darling and if you will not be so happy
at any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions for if
you who ought to keep and lead them go wandering astray what will
the goatherds talk amused all who heard it but especially the canon
who said to him as you live brother take it easy and be not in such
a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold for being a female as you
say she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to
prevent it take this morsel and drink a sup and that will soothe your
irritation and in the meantime the goat will rest herself and so
saying he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork
the goatherd took it with thanks and drank and calmed himself and then
said i should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpleton
for having spoken so seriously as i did to this animal but the truth is
there is a certain mystery in the words i used i am a clown but not so
much of one but that i know how to behave to men and to beasts
that i can well believe said the curate for i know already by
experience that the woods breed men of learning and shepherds harbour
at all events senor returned the goatherd they shelter men of
experience and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it though i
may seem to put myself forward without being asked i will if it will
not tire you gentlemen and you will give me your attention for a
little tell you a true story which will confirm this gentlemans word
and he pointed to the curate as well as my own
to this don quixote replied seeing that this affair has a certain
colour of chivalry about it i for my part brother will hear you most
gladly and so will all these gentlemen from the high intelligence they
possess and their love of curious novelties that interest charm and
entertain the mind as i feel quite sure your story will do so begin
friend for we are all prepared to listen
i draw my stakes said sancho and will retreat with this pasty to the
brook there where i mean to victual myself for three days for i have
heard my lord don quixote say that a knight errants squire should eat
until he can hold no more whenever he has the chance because it often
happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot
find a way out of it for six days and if the man is not well filled or
his alforjas well stored there he may stay as very often he does
thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixote go where thou
wilt and eat all thou canst for i have had enough and only want to give
my mind its refreshment as i shall by listening to this good fellows
it is what we shall all do said the canon and then begged the
the goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps
on the back saying lie down here beside me spotty for we have time
enough to return to our fold the goat seemed to understand him for as
her master seated himself she stretched herself quietly beside him and
looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he was
going to say and then in these words he began his story
which deals with what the goatherd told those who were carrying off don
three leagues from this valley there is a village which though small is
one of the richest in all this neighbourhood and in it there lived a
farmer a very worthy man and so much respected that although to be so
is the natural consequence of being rich he was even more respected for
his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired but what made him still
more fortunate as he said himself was having a daughter of such
exceeding beauty rare intelligence gracefulness and virtue that
everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts
with which heaven and nature had endowed her as a child she was
beautiful she continued to grow in beauty and at the age of sixteen she
was most lovely the fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through
all the villages around but why do i say the villages around merely
when it spread to distant cities and even made its way into the halls of
royalty and reached the ears of people of every class who came from all
sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious or some
her father watched over her and she watched over herself for there are
no locks or guards or bolts that can protect a young girl better than
her own modesty the wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter
led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife but he
as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel was
perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless
suitors he should entrust her i was one among the many who felt a desire
so natural and as her father knew who i was and i was of the same
town of pure blood in the bloom of life and very rich in possessions
i had great hopes of success there was another of the same place and
qualifications who also sought her and this made her fathers choice
hang in the balance for he felt that on either of us his daughter would
be well bestowed so to escape from this state of perplexity he resolved
to refer the matter to leandra for that is the name of the rich damsel
who has reduced me to misery reflecting that as we were both equal it
would be best to leave it to his dear daughter to choose according to her
inclination a course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish
to settle their children in life i do not mean that they ought to leave
them to make a choice of what is contemptible and bad but that they
should place before them what is good and then allow them to make a good
choice as they please i do not know which leandra chose i only know her
father put us both off with the tender age of his daughter and vague
words that neither bound him nor dismissed us my rival is called anselmo
and i myself eugenio that you may know the names of the personages that
figure in this tragedy the end of which is still in suspense though it
is plain to see it must be disastrous
about this time there arrived in our town one vicente de la roca the son
of a poor peasant of the same town the said vicente having returned from
service as a soldier in italy and divers other parts a captain who
chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from our
village when he was a boy of about twelve years and now twelve years
later the young man came back in a soldiers uniform arrayed in a
thousand colours and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains
to day he would appear in one gay dress to morrow in another but all
flimsy and gaudy of little substance and less worth the peasant folk
who are naturally malicious and when they have nothing to do can be
malice itself remarked all this and took note of his finery and
jewellery piece by piece and discovered that he had three suits of
different colours with garters and stockings to match but he made so
many arrangements and combinations out of them that if they had not
counted them anyone would have sworn that he had made a display of more
than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes do not look upon all this
that i am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out for
they have a great deal to do with the story he used to seat himself on a
bench under the great poplar in our plaza and there he would keep us all
hanging open mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits there was
no country on the face of the globe he had not seen nor battle he had
not been engaged in he had killed more moors than there are in morocco
and tunis and fought more single combats according to his own account
than garcilaso diego garcia de paredes and a thousand others he named
and out of all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood on
the other hand he showed marks of wounds which though they could not be
made out he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and
actions lastly with monstrous impudence he used to say you to his
equals and even those who knew what he was and declare that his arm was
his father and his deeds his pedigree and that being a soldier he was as
good as the king himself and to add to these swaggering ways he was a
trifle of a musician and played the guitar with such a flourish that
some said he made it speak nor did his accomplishments end here for he
was something of a poet too and on every trifle that happened in the
town he made a ballad a league long
this soldier then that i have described this vicente de la roca this
bravo gallant musician poet was often seen and watched by leandra
from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza the glitter of
his showy attire took her fancy his ballads bewitched her for he gave
away twenty copies of every one he made the tales of his exploits which
he told about himself came to her ears and in short as the devil no
doubt had arranged it she fell in love with him before the presumption
of making love to her had suggested itself to him and as in love affairs
none are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the
inclination of the lady for an ally leandra and vicente came to an
understanding without any difficulty and before any of her numerous
suitors had any suspicion of her design she had already carried it into
effect having left the house of her dearly beloved father for mother
she had none and disappeared from the village with the soldier who
came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the
large number he laid claim to all the village and all who heard of it
were amazed at the affair i was aghast anselmo thunderstruck her
father full of grief her relations indignant the authorities all in a
ferment the officers of the brotherhood in arms they scoured the roads
they searched the woods and all quarters and at the end of three days
they found the flighty leandra in a mountain cave stript to her shift
and robbed of all the money and precious jewels she had carried away from
they brought her back to her unhappy father and questioned her as to her
misfortune and she confessed without pressure that vicente de la roca
had deceived her and under promise of marrying her had induced her to
leave her fathers house as he meant to take her to the richest and most
delightful city in the whole world which was naples and that she
ill advised and deluded had believed him and robbed her father and
handed over all to him the night she disappeared and that he had carried
her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the eave where they had
found her she said moreover that the soldier without robbing her of
her honour had taken from her everything she had and made off leaving
her in the cave a thing that still further surprised everybody it was
not easy for us to credit the young mans continence but she asserted it
with such earnestness that it helped to console her distressed father
who thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost
can never be recovered had been left to his daughter the same day that
leandra made her appearance her father removed her from our sight and
took her away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this in the
hope that time may wear away some of the disgrace she has incurred
leandras youth furnished an excuse for her fault at least with those to
whom it was of no consequence whether she was good or bad but those who
knew her shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour
to ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women
which is for the most part flighty and ill regulated
leandra withdrawn from sight anselmos eyes grew blind or at any rate
found nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure and mine were in
darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable
while leandra was away our melancholy grew greater our patience grew
less we cursed the soldiers finery and railed at the carelessness of
leandras father at last anselmo and i agreed to leave the village and
come to this valley and he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own
and i a large herd of goats of mine we pass our life among the trees
giving vent to our sorrows together singing the fair leandras praises
or upbraiding her or else sighing alone and to heaven pouring forth our
complaints in solitude following our example many more of leandras
lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life
and they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned
into the pastoral arcadia so full is it of shepherds and sheep folds
nor is there a spot in it where the name of the fair leandra is not
heard here one curses her and calls her capricious fickle and
immodest there another condemns her as frail and frivolous this pardons
and absolves her that spurns and reviles her one extols her beauty
another assails her character and in short all abuse her and all adore
her and to such a pitch has this general infatuation gone that there are
some who complain of her scorn without ever having exchanged a word with
her and even some that bewail and mourn the raging fever of jealousy
for which she never gave anyone cause for as i have already said her
misconduct was known before her passion there is no nook among the
rocks no brookside no shade beneath the trees that is not haunted by
some shepherd telling his woes to the breezes wherever there is an echo
it repeats the name of leandra the mountains ring with leandra
leandra murmur the brooks and leandra keeps us all bewildered and
bewitched hoping without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear
of all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the most
sense is my rival anselmo for having so many other things to complain
of he only complains of separation and to the accompaniment of a
rebeck which he plays admirably he sings his complaints in verses that
show his ingenuity i follow another easier and to my mind wiser
course and that is to rail at the frivolity of women at their
inconstancy their double dealing their broken promises their unkept
pledges and in short the want of reflection they show in fixing their
affections and inclinations this sirs was the reason of words and
expressions i made use of to this goat when i came up just now for as
she is a female i have a contempt for her though she is the best in all
my fold this is the story i promised to tell you and if i have been
tedious in telling it i will not be slow to serve you my hut is close
by and i have fresh milk and dainty cheese there as well as a variety
of toothsome fruit no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate
of the quarrel that don quixote had with the goatherd together with the
rare adventure of the penitents which with an expenditure of sweat he
the goatherds tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers and the
canon especially enjoyed it for he had remarked with particular
attention the manner in which it had been told which was as unlike the
manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit
and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the
woods bred men of learning they all offered their services to eugenio
but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was don quixote who
said to him most assuredly brother goatherd if i found myself in a
position to attempt any adventure i would this very instant set out on
your behalf and would rescue leandra from that convent where no doubt
she is kept against her will in spite of the abbess and all who might
try to prevent me and would place her in your hands to deal with her
according to your will and pleasure observing however the laws of
chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to
any damsel but i trust in god our lord that the might of one malignant
enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better
disposed may prove superior to it and then i promise you my support and
assistance as i am bound to do by my profession which is none other
than to give aid to the weak and needy
the goatherd eyed him and noticing don quixotes sorry appearance and
looks he was filled with wonder and asked the barber who was next him
senor who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a
who should it be said the barber but the famous don quixote of la
mancha the undoer of injustice the righter of wrongs the protector of
damsels the terror of giants and the winner of battles
that said the goatherd sounds like what one reads in the books of
the knights errant who did all that you say this man does though it is
my belief that either you are joking or else this gentleman has empty
you are a great scoundrel said don quixote and it is you who are
empty and a fool i am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore
you and passing from words to deeds he caught up a loaf that was near
him and sent it full in the goatherds face with such force that he
flattened his nose but the goatherd who did not understand jokes and
found himself roughly handled in such good earnest paying no respect to
carpet tablecloth or diners sprang upon don quixote and seizing him
by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him had not
sancho panza that instant come to the rescue and grasping him by the
shoulders flung him down on the table smashing plates breaking glasses
and upsetting and scattering everything on it don quixote finding
himself free strove to get on top of the goatherd who with his face
covered with blood and soundly kicked by sancho was on all fours
feeling about for one of the table knives to take a bloody revenge with
the canon and the curate however prevented him but the barber so
contrived it that he got don quixote under him and rained down upon him
such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knights face streamed with
blood as freely as his own the canon and the curate were bursting with
laughter the officers were capering with delight and both the one and
the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in
a fight sancho alone was frantic for he could not free himself from the
grasp of one of the canons servants who kept him from going to his
at last while they were all with the exception of the two bruisers who
were mauling each other in high glee and enjoyment they heard a trumpet
sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction
whence the sound seemed to come but the one that was most excited by
hearing it was don quixote who though sorely against his will he was
under the goatherd and something more than pretty well pummelled said
to him brother devil for it is impossible but that thou must be one
since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine i ask
thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder
trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new
adventure the goatherd who was by this time tired of pummelling and
being pummelled released him at once and don quixote rising to his feet
and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard
suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white
the fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from
the earth and in all the villages of the district they were organising
processions rogations and penances imploring god to open the hands of
his mercy and send the rain and to this end the people of a village that
was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one
side of that valley don quixote when he saw the strange garb of the
penitents without reflecting how often he had seen it before took it
into his head that this was a case of adventure and that it fell to him
alone as a knight errant to engage in it and he was all the more
confirmed in this notion by the idea that an image draped in black they
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
discourteous thieves were carrying off by force as soon as this occurred
to him he ran with all speed to rocinante who was grazing at large and
taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle bow he had him bridled
in an instant and calling to sancho for his sword he mounted rocinante
braced his buckler on his arm and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who
stood by now noble company ye shall see how important it is that
there should be knights in the world professing the of knight errantry
now i say ye shall see by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is
borne captive there whether knights errant deserve to be held in
estimation and so saying he brought his legs to bear on rocinante for
he had no spurs and at a full canter for in all this veracious history
we never read of rocinante fairly galloping set off to encounter the
penitents though the curate the canon and the barber ran to prevent
him but it was out of their power nor did he even stop for the shouts
of sancho calling after him where are you going senor don quixote
what devils have possessed you to set you on against our catholic faith
plague take me mind that is a procession of penitents and the lady
they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the
immaculate virgin take care what you are doing senor for this time it
may be safely said you dont know what you are about sancho laboured in
vain for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted
figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word and
even had he heard he would not have turned back if the king had ordered
him he came up with the procession and reined in rocinante who was
already anxious enough to slacken speed a little and in a hoarse
excited voice he exclaimed you who hide your faces perhaps because you
are not good subjects pay attention and listen to what i am about to say
to you the first to halt were those who were carrying the image and
one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the litany struck by the
strange figure of don quixote the leanness of rocinante and the other
ludicrous peculiarities he observed said in reply to him brother if
you have anything to say to us say it quickly for these brethren are
whipping themselves and we cannot stop nor is it reasonable we should
stop to hear anything unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two
i will say it in one replied don quixote and it is this that at
once this very instant ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad
aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will and
that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her and i who
was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs will not permit
you to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty
from these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman and
began to laugh heartily and their laughter acted like gunpowder on don
quixotes fury for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush
at the stand one of those who supported it leaving the burden to his
comrades advanced to meet him flourishing a forked stick that he had
for propping up the stand when resting and with this he caught a mighty
cut don quixote made at him that severed it in two but with the portion
that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of don
quixotes sword arm which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault that poor don quixote came to the ground in a sad
sancho panza who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing seeing
him fall cried out to his assailant not to strike him again for he was
poor enchanted knight who had never harmed anyone all the days of his
life but what checked the clown was not sanchos shouting but seeing
that don quixote did not stir hand or foot and so fancying he had
killed him he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to
his heels across the country like a deer
by this time all don quixotes companions had come up to where he lay
but the processionists seeing them come running and with them the
officers of the brotherhood with their crossbows apprehended mischief
and clustering round the image raised their hoods and grasped their
scourges as the priests did their tapers and awaited the attack
resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against
their assailants if they could fortune however arranged the matter
better than they expected for all sancho did was to fling himself on his
masters body raising over him the most doleful and laughable
lamentation that ever was heard for he believed he was dead the curate
was known to another curate who walked in the procession and their
recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties
the first then told the other in two words who don quixote was and he
and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was
dead and heard sancho panza saying with tears in his eyes oh flower
of chivalry that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy
well spent life oh pride of thy race honour and glory of all la mancha
nay of all the world that for want of thee will be full of evil doers
no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds oh thou generous
above all the alexanders since for only eight months of service thou
hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds humble with the
proud haughty with the humble encounterer of dangers endurer of
outrages enamoured without reason imitator of the good scourge of the
wicked enemy of the mean in short knight errant which is all that can
at the cries and moans of sancho don quixote came to himself and the
first word he said was he who lives separated from you sweetest
dulcinea has greater miseries to endure than these aid me friend
sancho to mount the enchanted cart for i am not in a condition to press
the saddle of rocinante as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces
that i will do with all my heart senor said sancho and let us
return to our village with these gentlemen who seek your good and there
we will prepare for making another sally which may turn out more
thou art right sancho returned don quixote it will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off
the canon the curate and the barber told him he would act very wisely
in doing as he said and so highly amused at sancho panzas
simplicities they placed don quixote in the cart as before the
procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road
the goatherd took his leave of the party the officers of the brotherhood
declined to go any farther and the curate paid them what was due to
them the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did
whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it and then
begged leave to continue his journey in short they all separated and
went their ways leaving to themselves the curate and the barber don
quixote sancho panza and the good rocinante who regarded everything
with as great resignation as his master the carter yoked his oxen and
made don quixote comfortable on a truss of hay and at his usual
deliberate pace took the road the curate directed and at the end of six
days they reached don quixotes village and entered it about the middle
of the day which it so happened was a sunday and the people were all in
the plaza through which don quixotes cart passed they all flocked to
see what was in the cart and when they recognised their townsman they
were filled with amazement and a boy ran off to bring the news to his
housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all
lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox cart it was
piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised how they beat their
breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of
chivalry all which was renewed when they saw don quixote coming in at
at the news of don quixotes arrival sancho panzas wife came running
for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his
squire and on seeing sancho the first thing she asked him was if the
ass was well sancho replied that he was better than his master was
thanks be to god said she for being so good to me but now tell me
my friend what have you made by your squirings what gown have you
brought me back what shoes for your children
i bring nothing of that sort wife said sancho though i bring other
i am very glad of that returned his wife show me these things of
more value and consequence my friend for i want to see them to cheer my
heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been
i will show them to you at home wife said sancho be content for the
present for if it please god that we should again go on our travels in
search of adventures you will soon see me a count or governor of an
island and that not one of those everyday ones but the best that is to
heaven grant it husband said she for indeed we have need of it but
tell me whats this about islands for i dont understand it
honey is not for the mouth of the ass returned sancho all in good
time thou shalt see wife nay thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself
what are you talking about sancho with your ladyships islands and
vassals returned teresa panza for so sanchos wife was called though
they were not relations for in la mancha it is customary for wives to
dont be in such a hurry to know all this teresa said sancho it is
enough that i am telling you the truth so shut your mouth but i may
tell you this much by the way that there is nothing in the world more
delightful than to be a person of consideration squire to a
knight errant and a seeker of adventures to be sure most of those one
finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish for out of a hundred
ninety nine will turn out cross and contrary i know it by experience
for out of some i came blanketed and out of others belaboured still
for all that it is a fine thing to be on the look out for what may
happen crossing mountains searching woods climbing rocks visiting
castles putting up at inns all at free quarters and devil take the
while this conversation passed between sancho panza and his wife don
quixotes housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid
him in his old bed he eyed them askance and could not make out where he
was the curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle
comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape
from them again telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring
him home on this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed
their maledictions upon the books of chivalry and implored heaven to
plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the
bottomless pit they were in short kept in anxiety and dread lest their
uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself
somewhat better and as they feared so it fell out
but the author of this history though he has devoted research and
industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by don quixote in his
third sally has been unable to obtain any information respecting them
at any rate derived from authentic documents tradition has merely
preserved in the memory of la mancha the fact that don quixote the third
time he sallied forth from his home betook himself to saragossa where
he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city and
that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence
of his end and death he could learn no particulars nor would he have
ascertained it or known of it if good fortune had not produced an old
physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box which
according to his account had been discovered among the crumbling
foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt in which box
were found certain parchment manuscripts in gothic character but in
castilian verse containing many of his achievements and setting forth
the beauty of dulcinea the form of rocinante the fidelity of sancho
panza and the burial of don quixote himself together with sundry
epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character but all that could be
read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new
and unparalleled history here presents and the said author asks of those
that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost
him in examining and searching the manchegan archives in order to bring
it to light save that they give him the same credit that people of sense
give to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular
for with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied
and will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories if not as
truthful at least equal in invention and not less entertaining the
first words written on the parchment found in the leaden box were these
rich spoils than jasons who a point so keen
had to his wit and happier far had been
cathay and all the lands that lie between
as ever wrote on brass in days of yore
here underneath this cold stone doth he lie
she whose full features may be here descried
the great don quixote of la mancha sighed
for her tobosos queen from side to side
nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim
and left the marble to preserve his name
which the blood reeking feet of mars degrade
there hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade
he slays lays low cleaves hews but art hath made
if amadis be the proud boast of gaul
if by his progeny the fame of greece
through all the regions of the earth be spread
and above greece or gaul she holds her head
nor ends his glory here for his good steed
a great soul once was in that body small
nor was there squire upon this earthly ball
so plain and simple or of guile so free
within an ace of being count was he
and would have been but for the spite and gall
for mounted on an ass excuse the word
in shadows dreams and smoke ye always end
by the side of the knight is laid
and the pride of her village was she
these were all the verses that could be deciphered the rest the writing
being worm eaten were handed over to one of the academicians to make out
their meaning conjecturally we have been informed that at the cost of
many sleepless nights and much toil he has succeeded and that he means
to publish them in hopes of don quixotes third sally
