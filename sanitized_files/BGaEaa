from the heights poem translated by la magnus
supposing that truth is a woman what then is there not ground
for suspecting that all philosophers in so far as they have been
dogmatists have failed to understand women that the terrible
seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid
their addresses to truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods for
winning a woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won and
at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien if
indeed it stands at all for there are scoffers who maintain that it
has fallen that all dogma lies on the ground nay more that it is at
its last gasp but to speak seriously there are good grounds for hoping
that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive
and decided airs it has assumed may have been only a noble puerilism
and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once
and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such
imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have
hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time
such as the soul superstition which in the form of subject and
ego superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some
play upon words a deception on the part of grammar or an
audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very
human all too human facts the philosophy of the dogmatists it is to
be hoped was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards as was
astrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably more
labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any
actual science hitherto we owe to it and to its super terrestrial
pretensions in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture it seems
that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with
everlasting claims all great things have first to wander about the
earth as enormous and awe inspiring caricatures dogmatic philosophy has
been a caricature of this kind for instance the vedanta doctrine in
asia and platonism in europe let us not be ungrateful to it although
it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome
and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist
error namely platos invention of pure spirit and the good in itself
but now when it has been surmounted when europe rid of this nightmare
can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier sleep
we whose duty is wakefulness itself are the heirs of all the strength
which the struggle against this error has fostered it amounted to
the very inversion of truth and the denial of the perspective the
fundamental condition of life to speak of spirit and the good as plato
spoke of them indeed one might ask as a physician how did such a
malady attack that finest product of antiquity plato had the wicked
socrates really corrupted him was socrates after all a corrupter of
youths and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato
or to speak plainer and for the people the struggle against
the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity for
christianity is platonism for the people produced in europe
a magnificent tension of soul such as had not existed anywhere
previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the
furthest goals as a matter of fact the european feels this tension as
a state of distress and twice attempts have been made in grand style to
unbend the bow once by means of jesuitism and the second time by means
of democratic enlightenment which with the aid of liberty of the press
and newspaper reading might in fact bring it about that the spirit
would not so easily find itself in distress the germans invented
gunpowder all credit to them but they again made things square they
invented printing but we who are neither jesuits nor democrats
nor even sufficiently germans we good europeans and free very free
spirits we have it still all the distress of spirit and all the
tension of its bow and perhaps also the arrow the duty and who
1 the will to truth which is to tempt us to many a hazardous
enterprise the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have
hitherto spoken with respect what questions has this will to truth not
laid before us what strange perplexing questionable questions it is
already a long story yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced is
it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn
impatiently away that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions
ourselves who is it really that puts questions to us here what really
is this will to truth in us in fact we made a long halt at the
question as to the origin of this will until at last we came to an
absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question we inquired
about the value of this will granted that we want the truth why not
rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the
value of truth presented itself before us or was it we who presented
ourselves before the problem which of us is the oedipus here which
the sphinx it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of
interrogation and could it be believed that it at last seems to us as
if the problem had never been propounded before as if we were the first
to discern it get a sight of it and risk raising it for there is risk
in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk
2 how could anything originate out of its opposite for example truth
out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or the
generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sun bright vision of the
wise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible whoever dreams
of it is a fool nay worse than a fool things of the highest
value must have a different origin an origin of their own in this
transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of
delusion and cupidity they cannot have their source but rather in
the lap of being in the intransitory in the concealed god in the
thing in itself there must be their source and nowhere else this
mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which
metaphysicians of all times can be recognized this mode of valuation
is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of
theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that
is in the end solemnly christened the truth the fundamental belief of
metaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values it never occurred
even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where
doubt however was most necessary though they had made a solemn
vow de omnibus dubitandum for it may be doubted firstly whether
antitheses exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuations
and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their
seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimates merely provisional
perspectives besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from
below frog perspectives as it were to borrow an expression current
among painters in spite of all the value which may belong to the true
the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher
and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to
pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity it
might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and
respected things consists precisely in their being insidiously
related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed
things perhaps even in being essentially identical with them perhaps
but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses
for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of
philosophers such as will have other tastes and inclinations the
reverse of those hitherto prevalent philosophers of the dangerous
perhaps in every sense of the term and to speak in all seriousness i
3 having kept a sharp eye on philosophers and having read between
their lines long enough i now say to myself that the greater part of
conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions and
it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one has here to
learn anew as one learned anew about heredity and innateness as
little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process
and procedure of heredity just as little is being conscious opposed
to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the
conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his
instincts and forced into definite channels and behind all logic and
its seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuations or to speak
more plainly physiological demands for the maintenance of a definite
mode of life for example that the certain is worth more than the
uncertain that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuations
in spite of their regulative importance for us might notwithstanding be
only superficial valuations special kinds of niaiserie such as may
be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves supposing
in effect that man is not just the measure of things
4 the falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it it is
here perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely the
question is how far an opinion is life furthering life preserving
species preserving perhaps species rearing and we are fundamentally
inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions to which the synthetic
judgments a priori belong are the most indispensable to us that
without a recognition of logical fictions without a comparison of
reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable
without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers
man could not live that the renunciation of false opinions would be
a renunciation of life a negation of life to recognise untruth as a
condition of life that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of
value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which ventures to do so
has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil
5 that which causes philosophers to be regarded half distrustfully
and half mockingly is not the oft repeated discovery how innocent they
are how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way in
short how childish and childlike they are but that there is not
enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and
virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in
the remotest manner they all pose as though their real opinions had
been discovered and attained through the self evolving of a cold pure
divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mystics
who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a
prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally
their hearts desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with
arguments sought out after the event they are all advocates who do not
wish to be regarded as such generally astute defenders also of their
prejudices which they dub truths and very far from having the
conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having
the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be
understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence
and self ridicule the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant equally
stiff and decent with which he entices us into the dialectic
by ways that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical
imperative makes us fastidious ones smile we who find no small
amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical
preachers or still more so the hocus pocus in mathematical form by
means of which spinoza has as it were clad his philosophy in mail and
mask in fact the love of his wisdom to translate the term fairly
and squarely in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart
of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible
maiden that pallas athene how much of personal timidity and
vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray
6 it has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up
till now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and
a species of involuntary and unconscious auto biography and moreover
that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constituted
the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown
indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a
philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first
ask oneself what morality do they or does he aim at accordingly
i do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of
philosophy but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only made
use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument but whoever
considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining
how far they may have here acted as inspiring genii or as demons and
cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time
or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to
look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate
lord over all the other impulses for every impulse is imperious and as
such attempts to philosophize to be sure in the case of scholars in
the case of really scientific men it may be otherwise better if
you will there there may really be such a thing as an impulse to
knowledge some kind of small independent clock work which when well
wound up works away industriously to that end without the rest of
the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein the actual
interests of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another
direction in the family perhaps or in money making or in politics
it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little
machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a
good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not
characterised by becoming this or that in the philosopher on the
contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all
his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he
is that is to say in what order the deepest impulses of his nature
7 how malicious philosophers can be i know of nothing more stinging
than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the
platonists he called them dionysiokolakes in its original sense
and on the face of it the word signifies flatterers of
besides this however it is as much as to say they are all actors
there is nothing genuine about them for dionysiokolax was a popular
name for an actor and the latter is really the malignant reproach that
epicurus cast upon plato he was annoyed by the grandiose manner the
mise en scene style of which plato and his scholars were masters of
which epicurus was not a master he the old school teacher of samos
who sat concealed in his little garden at athens and wrote three
hundred books perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato who
knows greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden god
epicurus really was did she ever find out
8 there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of
the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the words of an
9 you desire to live according to nature oh you noble stoics what
fraud of words imagine to yourselves a being like nature boundlessly
without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain
imagine to yourselves indifference as a power how could you live
in accordance with such indifference to live is not that just
endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuing
preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different
and granted that your imperative living according to nature means
actually the same as living according to life how could you do
differently why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves
are and must be in reality however it is quite otherwise with you
while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in nature
you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stage players
and self deluders in your pride you wish to dictate your morals and
ideals to nature to nature herself and to incorporate them therein
you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa and would
like everything to be made after your own image as a vast eternal
glorification and generalism of stoicism with all your love for truth
you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such
hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely that is to say stoically
that you are no longer able to see it otherwise and to crown all some
unfathomable superciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope that
because you are able to tyrannize over yourselves stoicism is
self tyranny nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is
not the stoic a part of nature but this is an old and everlasting
story what happened in old times with the stoics still happens today
as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself it always
creates the world in its own image it cannot do otherwise philosophy
is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual will to power the
will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima
10 the eagerness and subtlety i should even say craftiness with
which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at
present throughout europe furnishes food for thought and attention and
he who hears only a will to truth in the background and nothing else
cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears in rare and isolated
cases it may really have happened that such a will to truth a certain
extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of the
forlorn hope has participated therein that which in the end always
prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful
possibilities there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience
who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an
uncertain something but that is nihilism and the sign of a despairing
mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a
virtue may display it seems however to be otherwise with stronger
and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life in that they side
against appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in
that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the
credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still and
thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession
to escape for what does one at present believe in more firmly than
in ones body who knows if they are not really trying to win back
something which was formerly an even securer possession something
of the old domain of the faith of former times perhaps the immortal
soul perhaps the old god in short ideas by which they could live
better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by
modern ideas there is distrust of these modern ideas in this mode
of looking at things a disbelief in all that has been constructed
yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety
and scorn which can no longer endure the bric a brac of ideas of the
most varied origin such as so called positivism at present throws on
the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the village fair
motleyness and patchiness of all these reality philosophasters in whom
there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness therein it
seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti realists and
knowledge microscopists of the present day their instinct which repels
them from modern reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde
by paths concern us the main thing about them is not that they wish
to go back but that they wish to get away therefrom a little more
strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be off and
11 it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to
divert attention from the actual influence which kant exercised on
german philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which
he set upon himself kant was first and foremost proud of his table of
categories with it in his hand he said this is the most difficult
thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics let us
only understand this could be he was proud of having discovered a
new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori granting
that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid
flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and
on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible
something at all events new faculties of which to be still
prouder but let us reflect for a moment it is high time to do so
how are synthetic judgments a priori possible kant asks himself and
what is really his answer by means of a means faculty but
unfortunately not in five words but so circumstantially imposingly
and with such display of german profundity and verbal flourishes that
one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved
in such an answer people were beside themselves with delight over this
new faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further
discovered a moral faculty in man for at that time germans were still
moral not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact then came
the honeymoon of german philosophy all the young theologians of the
tubingen institution went immediately into the groves all seeking for
faculties and what did they not find in that innocent rich and
still youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism the
malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish
between finding and inventing above all a faculty for the
and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally
pious inclined germans one can do no greater wrong to the whole of
this exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulness
notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile
conceptions than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral
indignation enough however the world grew older and the dream
vanished a time came when people rubbed their foreheads and they still
rub them today people had been dreaming and first and foremost old
kant by means of a means faculty he had said or at least meant to
say but is that an answer an explanation or is it not rather merely
a repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by means of
a means faculty namely the virtus dormitiva replies the doctor in
but such replies belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time
to replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgments a priori
possible by another question why is belief in such judgments
necessary in effect it is high time that we should understand
that such judgments must be believed to be true for the sake of the
preservation of creatures like ourselves though they still might
naturally be false judgments or more plainly spoken and roughly and
readily synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all
we have no right to them in our mouths they are nothing but false
judgments only of course the belief in their truth is necessary as
plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view
of life and finally to call to mind the enormous influence which
german philosophy i hope you understand its right to inverted commas
goosefeet has exercised throughout the whole of europe there is
no doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it thanks to
german philosophy it was a delight to the noble idlers the virtuous
the mystics the artiste the three fourths christians and the
political obscurantists of all nations to find an antidote to the still
overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into
12 as regards materialistic atomism it is one of the best refuted
theories that have been advanced and in europe there is now perhaps
no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious
signification to it except for convenient everyday use as an
abbreviation of the means of expression thanks chiefly to the pole
boscovich he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatest
and most successful opponents of ocular evidence for while copernicus
has persuaded us to believe contrary to all the senses that the earth
does not stand fast boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the
last thing that stood fast of the earth the belief in substance in
matter in the earth residuum and particle atom it is the greatest
triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth one
must however go still further and also declare war relentless war
to the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead a
dangerous after life in places where no one suspects them like the more
celebrated metaphysical requirements one must also above all give
the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which
christianity has taught best and longest the soul atomism let it be
permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the
soul as something indestructible eternal indivisible as a monad
as an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science between
ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby
and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses as
happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists who can hardly
touch on the soul without immediately losing it but the way is open
for new acceptations and refinements of the soul hypothesis and such
conceptions as mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity
and soul as social structure of the instincts and passions want
henceforth to have legitimate rights in science in that the new
psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have
hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of
the soul he is really as it were thrusting himself into a new desert
and a new distrust it is possible that the older psychologists had a
merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he finds
that precisely thereby he is also condemned to invent and who knows
13 psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
instinct of self preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
being a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength life
itself is will to power self preservation is only one of the indirect
and most frequent results thereof in short here as everywhere else
let us beware of superfluous teleological principles one of which
is the instinct of self preservation we owe it to spinozas
inconsistency it is thus in effect that method ordains which must
14 it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural
philosophy is only a world exposition and world arrangement according
to us if i may say so and not a world explanation but in so far as
it is based on belief in the senses it is regarded as more and for a
long time to come must be regarded as more namely as an explanation
it has eyes and fingers of its own it has ocular evidence and
palpableness of its own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and
convincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes in fact it
follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism
what is clear what is explained only that which can be seen and
felt one must pursue every problem thus far obversely however the
charm of the platonic mode of thought which was an aristocratic mode
consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense evidence perhaps
among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our
contemporaries but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining
masters of them and this by means of pale cold grey conceptional
networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses the
mob of the senses as plato said in this overcoming of the world and
interpreting of the world in the manner of plato there was an enjoyment
different from that which the physicists of today offer us and likewise
the darwinists and anti teleologists among the physiological workers
with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest
possible blunder where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there
is also nothing more for men to do that is certainly an imperative
different from the platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right
imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinists and bridge builders
of the future who have nothing but rough work to perform
15 to study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on
the fact that the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of the
idealistic philosophy as such they certainly could not be causes
sensualism therefore at least as regulative hypothesis if not as
heuristic principle what and others say even that the external world
is the work of our organs but then our body as a part of this external
world would be the work of our organs but then our organs themselves
would be the work of our organs it seems to me that this is a
complete reductio ad absurdum if the conception causa sui is something
fundamentally absurd consequently the external world is not the work
16 there are still harmless self observers who believe that there are
immediate certainties for instance i think or as the superstition
of schopenhauer puts it i will as though cognition here got hold
of its object purely and simply as the thing in itself without any
falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the
object i would repeat it however a hundred times that immediate
certainty as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itself
involve a contradictio in adjecto we really ought to free ourselves
from the misleading significance of words the people on their part may
think that cognition is knowing all about things but the philosopher
must say to himself when i analyze the process that is expressed in
the sentence i think i find a whole series of daring assertions the
argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible
for instance that it is i who think that there must necessarily be
something that thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on the
part of a being who is thought of as a cause that there is an ego
and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by
thinking that i know what thinking is for if i had not already decided
within myself what it is by what standard could i determine whether
that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling in
short the assertion i think assumes that i compare my state at the
present moment with other states of myself which i know in order to
determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with
further knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty for
me in place of the immediate certainty in which the people may
believe in the special case the philosopher thus finds a series of
metaphysical questions presented to him veritable conscience questions
of the intellect to wit whence did i get the notion of thinking
why do i believe in cause and effect what gives me the right to speak
of an ego and even of an ego as cause and finally of an ego
as cause of thought he who ventures to answer these metaphysical
questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception like
the person who says i think and know that this at least is
true actual and certain will encounter a smile and two notes of
interrogation in a philosopher nowadays sir the philosopher will
perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not
mistaken but why should it be the truth
17 with regard to the superstitions of logicians i shall never tire
of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by
these credulous minds namely that a thought comes when it wishes
and not when i wish so that it is a perversion of the facts of the
case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate
think one thinks but that this one is precisely the famous old
ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and
assuredly not an immediate certainty after all one has even gone too
far with this one thinks even the one contains an interpretation of
the process and does not belong to the process itself one infers here
according to the usual grammatical formula to think is an activity
every activity requires an agency that is active consequently it
was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought besides
the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out
of which it operates the atom more rigorous minds however learnt at
last to get along without this earth residuum and perhaps some day we
shall accustom ourselves even from the logicians point of view to
get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego has
18 it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is
refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle
minds it seems that the hundred times refuted theory of the free will
owes its persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing
who feels himself strong enough to refute it
19 philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were
the best known thing in the world indeed schopenhauer has given us
to understand that the will alone is really known to us absolutely and
completely known without deduction or addition but it again and
again seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did what
philosophers are in the habit of doing he seems to have adopted a
popular prejudice and exaggerated it willing seems to me to be above
all something complicated something that is a unity only in name and
it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which has got
the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages
so let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical let
us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations
namely the sensation of the condition away from which we go the
sensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of this
from and towards itself and then besides an accompanying muscular
sensation which even without our putting in motion arms and legs
commences its action by force of habit directly we will anything
therefore just as sensations and indeed many kinds of sensations are
to be recognized as ingredients of the will so in the second place
thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is
a ruling thought and let us not imagine it possible to sever this
thought from the willing as if the will would then remain over
in the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and
thinking but it is above all an emotion and in fact the emotion of the
command that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the
emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey i am free he
must obey this consciousness is inherent in every will and equally
so the straining of the attention the straight look which fixes itself
exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and
nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience
will be rendered and whatever else pertains to the position of the
commander a man who wills commands something within himself which
renders obedience or which he believes renders obedience but now let
us notice what is the strangest thing about the will this affair so
extremely complex for which the people have only one name inasmuch as
in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and
the obeying parties and as the obeying party we know the sensations of
constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually
commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch as on the other
hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive
ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i a whole series
of erroneous conclusions and consequently of false judgments about the
will itself has become attached to the act of willing to such a degree
that he who wills believes firmly that willing suffices for action
since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will
when the effect of the command consequently obedience and therefore
action was to be expected the appearance has translated itself into
the sentiment as if there were a necessity of effect in a word he who
wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are
somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing
to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation
of power which accompanies all success freedom of will that is the
expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising
volition who commands and at the same time identifies himself with
the executor of the order who as such enjoys also the triumph over
obstacles but thinks within himself that it was really his own will
that overcame them in this way the person exercising volition adds the
feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments the useful
underwills or under souls indeed our body is but a social structure
composed of many souls to his feelings of delight as commander leffet
cest moi what happens here is what happens in every well constructed
and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies
itself with the successes of the commonwealth in all willing it is
absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis as
already said of a social structure composed of many souls on which
account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing as such
within the sphere of morals regarded as the doctrine of the relations
of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself
20 that the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or
autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with
each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear
in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just as much to
a system as the collective members of the fauna of a continent is
betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most
diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme
of possible philosophies under an invisible spell they always revolve
once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they
may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills something
within them leads them something impels them in definite order the
one after the other to wit the innate methodology and relationship
of their ideas their thinking is in fact far less a discovery than a
re recognizing a remembering a return and a home coming to a far off
ancient common household of the soul out of which those ideas formerly
grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order
the wonderful family resemblance of all indian greek and german
philosophizing is easily enough explained in fact where there is
affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammar i mean
owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical
functions it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset
for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems
just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of
world interpretation it is highly probable that philosophers within the
domain of the ural altaic languages where the conception of the subject
is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be
found on paths of thought different from those of the indo germans and
mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately
also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions so
much by way of rejecting lockes superficiality with regard to the
21 the causa sui is the best self contradiction that has yet been
conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the
extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and
frightfully with this very folly the desire for freedom of will
in the superlative metaphysical sense such as still holds sway
unfortunately in the minds of the half educated the desire to bear
the entire and ultimate responsibility for ones actions oneself and
to absolve god the world ancestors chance and society therefrom
involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui and with
more than munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the
hair out of the slough of nothingness if any one should find out in
this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free
will and put it out of his head altogether i beg of him to carry
his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the
contrary of this monstrous conception of free will i mean non free
will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect one
should not wrongly materialise cause and effect as the natural
philosophers do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at
present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes
the cause press and push until it effects its end one should use
cause and effect only as pure conceptions that is to say as
conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual
understanding not for explanation in being in itself there is
nothing of casual connection of necessity or of psychological
non freedom there the effect does not follow the cause there law
does not obtain it is we alone who have devised cause sequence
and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbol world
as being in itself with things we act once more as we have always
acted mythologically the non free will is mythology in real life
it is only a question of strong and weak wills it is almost always
a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every
of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and non freedom
it is suspicious to have such feelings the person betrays himself and
in general if i have observed correctly the non freedom of the will
is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints but
always in a profoundly personal manner some will not give up their
responsibility their belief in themselves the personal right to
their merits at any price the vain races belong to this class others
on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed
for anything and owing to an inward self contempt seek to get out of
the business no matter how the latter when they write books are
in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals a sort of
socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise and as a matter of
fact the fatalism of the weak willed embellishes itself surprisingly
when it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine that is its
22 let me be pardoned as an old philologist who cannot desist from
the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation but
natures conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudly
as though why it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad
philology it is no matter of fact no text but rather just a
naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which
you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern
soul everywhere equality before the law nature is not different in
that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive
in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and
autocratic likewise a second and more refined atheism is once more
disguised ni dieu ni maitre that also is what you want and
therefore cheers for natural law is it not so but as has been
said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along
who with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation could read
out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena just
the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims
of power an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and
unconditionalness of all will to power before your eyes that almost
every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem
unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphor as being too
human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about
this world as you do namely that it has a necessary and calculable
course not however because laws obtain in it but because they are
absolutely lacking and every power effects its ultimate consequences
every moment granted that this also is only interpretation and you
will be eager enough to make this objection well so much the better
23 all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and
timidities it has not dared to launch out into the depths in so far
as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written
evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent it seems as if
nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the morphology
and development doctrine of the will to power as i conceive of it
the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most
intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and
unprejudiced and has obviously operated in an injurious obstructive
blinding and distorting manner a proper physio psychology has to
contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator
it has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal
conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses causes as
refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly
conscience still more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good
impulses from bad ones if however a person should regard even
the emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness
as life conditioning emotions as factors which must be present
fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which
must therefore be further developed if life is to be further
developed he will suffer from such a view of things as from
sea sickness and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest
and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous
knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one
should keep away from it who can do so on the other hand if one has
once drifted hither with ones bark well very good now let us set our
teeth firmly let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm
we sail away right over morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the
remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither but
what do we matter never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal
itself to daring travelers and adventurers and the psychologist who
thus makes a sacrifice it is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto
on the contrary will at least be entitled to demand in return that
psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences
for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist for psychology
is once more the path to the fundamental problems
24 o sancta simplicitiatas in what strange simplification and
falsification man lives one can never cease wondering when once one has
got eyes for beholding this marvel how we have made everything around
us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give
our senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a godlike
desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences how from the beginning
we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost
and gaiety in order to enjoy life and only on this solidified
granite like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself
hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful
will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not as
its opposite but as its refinement it is to be hoped indeed that
language here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and that
it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees
and many refinements of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the
incarnated tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerable
flesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of us
discerning ones here and there we understand it and laugh at the way
in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this
falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it loves
error because as living itself it loves life
25 after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be
heard it appeals to the most serious minds take care ye philosophers
and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the
truths sake even in your own defense it spoils all the innocence
and fine neutrality of your conscience it makes you headstrong against
objections and red rags it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when
in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even
worse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last card
as protectors of truth upon earth as though the truth were such an
innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of
all people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafers and
cobweb spinners of the spirit finally ye know sufficiently well that
it cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point ye know
that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there might
be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark
which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and
occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and
trumping games before accusers and law courts rather go out of the way
flee into concealment and have your masks and your ruses that ye may
be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared and pray dont forget
the garden the garden with golden trellis work and have people around
you who are as a garden or as music on the waters at eventide when
already the day becomes a memory choose the good solitude the free
wanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still to
remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous how crafty how bad
does every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by means
of force how personal does a long fear make one a long watching
of enemies of possible enemies these pariahs of society these
long pursued badly persecuted ones also the compulsory recluses the
spinozas or giordano brunos always become in the end even under the
most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware
of it refined vengeance seekers and poison brewers just lay bare
the foundation of spinozas ethics and theology not to speak of
the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a
philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him the
martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth
forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him
and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity
with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous
desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a
martyr into a stage and tribune bawler only that it is necessary
with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any
case merely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the
continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing that
every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin
26 every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy
where he is free from the crowd the many the majority where he may
forget men who are the rule as their exception exclusive only of
the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger
instinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense whoever in
intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the green
and grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy
gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes
supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burden
and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains
as i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then
certain he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge for as
such he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good
taste but the rule is more interesting than the exception than
myself the exception and he would go down and above all he would
go inside the long and serious study of the average man and
consequently much disguise self overcoming familiarity and bad
intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with ones
equals that constitutes a necessary part of the life history of every
philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing
part if he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledge
should be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and
lighten his task i mean so called cynics those who simply recognize
the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the
same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them
talk of themselves and their like before witnesses sometimes they
wallow even in books as on their own dung hill cynicism is the only
form in which base souls approach what is called honesty and the
higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism and
congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before
him or the scientific satyr speaks out there are even cases where
enchantment mixes with the disgust namely where by a freak of nature
genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy goat and ape as in the
case of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also
filthiest man of his century he was far profounder than voltaire and
consequently also a good deal more silent it happens more frequently
as has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an apes body a
fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no means
rare especially among doctors and moral physiologists and whenever
anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man
as a belly with two requirements and a head with one whenever any one
sees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity
as the real and only motives of human actions in short when any one
speaks badly and not even ill of man then ought the lover of
knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general
to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation for the
indignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with
his own teeth or in place of himself the world god or society
may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and
self satisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary
more indifferent and less instructive case and no one is such a liar
27 it is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks and
lives gangasrotogati footnote like the river ganges presto among
those only who think and live otherwise namely kurmagati footnote
like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati
footnote like the frog staccato i do everything to be difficultly
understood myself and one should be heartily grateful for the
good will to some refinement of interpretation as regards the good
friends however who are always too easy going and think that as
friends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first to
grant them a play ground and romping place for misunderstanding one can
thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friends and
28 what is most difficult to render from one language into another
is the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of the
race or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of the
assimilation of its nutriment there are honestly meant translations
which as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of the
original merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and
obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be
rendered a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language
consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the most
delightful and daring nuances of free free spirited thought and just
as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience
so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him everything
ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all long winded and wearying
species of style are developed in profuse variety among germans pardon
me for stating the fact that even goethes prose in its mixture of
stiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the good
old time to which it belongs and as an expression of german taste at a
time when there was still a german taste which was a rococo taste
in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic
nature which understood much and was versed in many things he who was
not the translator of bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in
the shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among the
