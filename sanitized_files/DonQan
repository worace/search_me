awoke and beheld her he said this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my
bone and god said for this shall a man leave his father and his
mother and they shall be two in one flesh and then was instituted the
divine sacrament of marriage with such ties that death alone can loose
them and such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that
it makes two different persons one and the same flesh and even more than
this when the virtuous are married for though they have two souls they
have but one will and hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is
one and the same with that of her husband the stains that may come upon
it or the injuries it incurs fall upon the husbands flesh though he
as has been said may have given no cause for them for as the pain of
the foot or any member of the body is felt by the whole body because all
is one flesh as the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having
caused it so the husband being one with her shares the dishonour of
the wife and as all worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and
blood and the erring wifes is of that kind the husband must needs bear
his part of it and be held dishonoured without knowing it see then
anselmo the peril thou art encountering in seeking to disturb the peace
of thy virtuous consort see for what an empty and ill advised curiosity
thou wouldst rouse up passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of
thy chaste wife reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little
and what thou wilt lose so much that i leave it undescribed not having
the words to express it but if all i have said be not enough to turn
thee from thy vile purpose thou must seek some other instrument for thy
dishonour and misfortune for such i will not consent to be though i
lose thy friendship the greatest loss that i can conceive
having said this the wise and virtuous lothario was silent and anselmo
troubled in mind and deep in thought was unable for a while to utter a
word in reply but at length he said i have listened lothario my
friend attentively as thou hast seen to what thou hast chosen to say
to me and in thy arguments examples and comparisons i have seen that
high intelligence thou dost possess and the perfection of true
friendship thou hast reached and likewise i see and confess that if i am
not guided by thy opinion but follow my own i am flying from the good
and pursuing the evil this being so thou must remember that i am now
labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes suffer from when
the craving seizes them to eat clay plaster charcoal and things even
worse disgusting to look at much more to eat so that it will be
necessary to have recourse to some artifice to cure me and this can be
easily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning even though it be in
a lukewarm and make believe fashion to pay court to camilla who will
not be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first attack
with this mere attempt i shall rest satisfied and thou wilt have done
what our friendship binds thee to do not only in giving me life but in
persuading me not to discard my honour and this thou art bound to do for
one reason alone that being as i am resolved to apply this test it
is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another and so
imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing and if
thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of camilla
while thou art paying court to her that is of little or no importance
because ere long on finding in her that constancy which we expect thou
canst tell her the plain truth as regards our stratagem and so regain
thy place in her esteem and as thou art venturing so little and by the
venture canst afford me so much satisfaction refuse not to undertake it
even if further difficulties present themselves to thee for as i have
said if thou wilt only make a beginning i will acknowledge the issue
lothario seeing the fixed determination of anselmo and not knowing what
further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade him
from it and perceiving that he threatened to confide his pernicious
scheme to some one else to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him
and do what he asked intending to manage the business so as to satisfy
anselmo without corrupting the mind of camilla so in reply he told him
not to communicate his purpose to any other for he would undertake the
task himself and would begin it as soon as he pleased anselmo embraced
him warmly and affectionately and thanked him for his offer as if he had
bestowed some great favour upon him and it was agreed between them to
set about it the next day anselmo affording opportunity and time to
lothario to converse alone with camilla and furnishing him with money
and jewels to offer and present to her he suggested too that he should
treat her to music and write verses in her praise and if he was
unwilling to take the trouble of composing them he offered to do it
himself lothario agreed to all with an intention very different from
what anselmo supposed and with this understanding they returned to
anselmos house where they found camilla awaiting her husband anxiously
and uneasily for he was later than usual in returning that day lothario
repaired to his own house and anselmo remained in his as well satisfied
as lothario was troubled in mind for he could see no satisfactory way
out of this ill advised business that night however he thought of a
plan by which he might deceive anselmo without any injury to camilla the
next day he went to dine with his friend and was welcomed by camilla
who received and treated him with great cordiality knowing the affection
her husband felt for him when dinner was over and the cloth removed
anselmo told lothario to stay there with camilla while he attended to
some pressing business as he would return in an hour and a half camilla
begged him not to go and lothario offered to accompany him but nothing
could persuade anselmo who on the contrary pressed lothario to remain
waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with
him at the same time he bade camilla not to leave lothario alone until
he came back in short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason
or the folly of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a
anselmo took his departure and camilla and lothario were left alone at
the table for the rest of the household had gone to dinner lothario saw
himself in the lists according to his friends wish and facing an enemy
that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights
judge whether he had good reason to fear but what he did was to lean his
elbow on the arm of the chair and his cheek upon his hand and asking
camillas pardon for his ill manners he said he wished to take a little
sleep until anselmo returned camilla in reply said he could repose more
at his ease in the reception room than in his chair and begged of him to
go in and sleep there but lothario declined and there he remained
asleep until the return of anselmo who finding camilla in her own room
and lothario asleep imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have
afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep and was
all impatience until lothario should wake up that he might go out with
him and question him as to his success everything fell out as he wished
lothario awoke and the two at once left the house and anselmo asked
what he was anxious to know and lothario in answer told him that he had
not thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time and
therefore had only extolled the charms of camilla telling her that all
the city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit for this seemed to
him an excellent way of beginning to gain her good will and render her
disposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time thus availing
himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive one
who is on the watch for he being the angel of darkness transforms
himself into an angel of light and under cover of a fair seeming
discloses himself at length and effects his purpose if at the beginning
his wiles are not discovered all this gave great satisfaction to
anselmo and he said he would afford the same opportunity every day but
without leaving the house for he would find things to do at home so that
thus then several days went by and lothario without uttering a word
to camilla reported to anselmo that he had talked with her and that he
had never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of consent
to anything dishonourable nor even a sign or shadow of hope on the
contrary he said she would inform her husband of it
so far well said anselmo camilla has thus far resisted words we
must now see how she will resist deeds i will give you to morrow two
thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present and as many
more to buy jewels to lure her for women are fond of being becomingly
attired and going gaily dressed and all the more so if they are
beautiful however chaste they may be and if she resists this
temptation i will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble
lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertaking
to the end though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and
vanquished the next day he received the four thousand crowns and with
them four thousand perplexities for he knew not what to say by way of a
new falsehood but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that
camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words and
that there was no use in taking any further trouble for the time was all
but chance directing things in a different manner so ordered it that
anselmo having left lothario and camilla alone as on other occasions
shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen
through the keyhole to what passed between them and perceived that for
more than half an hour lothario did not utter a word to camilla nor
would utter a word though he were to be there for an age and he came to
the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies of
camilla was all invention and falsehood and to ascertain if it were so
he came out and calling lothario aside asked him what news he had and in
what humour camilla was lothario replied that he was not disposed to go
on with the business for she had answered him so angrily and harshly
that he had no heart to say anything more to her
ah lothario lothario said anselmo how ill dost thou meet thy
obligations to me and the great confidence i repose in thee i have been
just now watching through this keyhole and i have seen that thou has not
said a word to camilla whence i conclude that on the former occasions
thou hast not spoken to her either and if this be so as no doubt it is
why dost thou deceive me or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive
me of the means i might find of attaining my desire
anselmo said no more but he had said enough to cover lothario with shame
and confusion and he feeling as it were his honour touched by having
been detected in a lie swore to anselmo that he would from that moment
devote himself to satisfying him without any deception as he would see
if he had the curiosity to watch though he need not take the trouble
for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all suspicions
from his mind anselmo believed him and to afford him an opportunity
more free and less liable to surprise he resolved to absent himself from
his house for eight days betaking himself to that of a friend of his who
lived in a village not far from the city and the better to account for
his departure to camilla he so arranged it that the friend should send
unhappy shortsighted anselmo what art thou doing what art thou
plotting what art thou devising bethink thee thou art working against
thyself plotting thine own dishonour devising thine own ruin thy wife
camilla is virtuous thou dost possess her in peace and quietness no one
assails thy happiness her thoughts wander not beyond the walls of thy
house thou art her heaven on earth the object of her wishes the
fulfilment of her desires the measure wherewith she measures her will
making it conform in all things to thine and heavens if then the mine
of her honour beauty virtue and modesty yields thee without labour all
the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for why wilt thou dig the
earth in search of fresh veins of new unknown treasure risking the
collapse of all since it but rests on the feeble props of her weak
nature bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities that which
is possible may with justice be withheld as was better expressed by a
tis mine to seek for life in death
the next day anselmo took his departure for the village leaving
instructions with camilla that during his absence lothario would come to
look after his house and to dine with her and that she was to treat him
as she would himself camilla was distressed as a discreet and
right minded woman would be at the orders her husband left her and bade
him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his seat
at the table during his absence and if he acted thus from not feeling
confidence that she would be able to manage his house let him try her
this time and he would find by experience that she was equal to greater
responsibilities anselmo replied that it was his pleasure to have it so
and that she had only to submit and obey camilla said she would do so
anselmo went and the next day lothario came to his house where he was
received by camilla with a friendly and modest welcome but she never
suffered lothario to see her alone for she was always attended by her
men and women servants especially by a handmaid of hers leonela by
name to whom she was much attached for they had been brought up
together from childhood in her fathers house and whom she had kept
with her after her marriage with anselmo the first three days lothario
did not speak to her though he might have done so when they removed the
cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily for such were camillas
orders nay more leonela had directions to dine earlier than camilla and
never to leave her side she however having her thoughts fixed upon
other things more to her taste and wanting that time and opportunity for
her own pleasures did not always obey her mistresss commands but on
the contrary left them alone as if they had ordered her to do so but
the modest bearing of camilla the calmness of her countenance the
composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the tongue of lothario but
the influence which the many virtues of camilla exerted in imposing
silence on lotharios tongue proved mischievous for both of them for if
his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy and could dwell at leisure
upon the perfections of camillas goodness and beauty one by one charms
enough to warm with love a marble statue not to say a heart of flesh
lothario gazed upon her when he might have been speaking to her and
thought how worthy of being loved she was and thus reflection began
little by little to assail his allegiance to anselmo and a thousand
times he thought of withdrawing from the city and going where anselmo
should never see him nor he see camilla but already the delight he found
in gazing on her interposed and held him fast he put a constraint upon
himself and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he found in
contemplating camilla when alone he blamed himself for his weakness
called himself a bad friend nay a bad christian then he argued the
matter and compared himself with anselmo always coming to the conclusion
that the folly and rashness of anselmo had been worse than his
faithlessness and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily
before god as with man he had no reason to fear any punishment for his
in short the beauty and goodness of camilla joined with the opportunity
which the blind husband had placed in his hands overthrew the loyalty of
lothario and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which his
inclinations led him after anselmo had been three days absent during
which he had been carrying on a continual struggle with his passion he
began to make love to camilla with so much vehemence and warmth of
language that she was overwhelmed with amazement and could only rise
from her place and retire to her room without answering him a word but
the hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in lothario
by this repelling demeanour on the contrary his passion for camilla
increased and she discovering in him what she had never expected knew
not what to do and considering it neither safe nor right to give him the
chance or opportunity of speaking to her again she resolved to send as
she did that very night one of her servants with a letter to anselmo in
which she addressed the following words to him
in which is continued the novel of the ill advised curiosity
it is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a
castle without its castellan and i say that a young married woman looks
still worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for
it i find myself so ill at ease without you and so incapable of
enduring this separation that unless you return quickly i shall have to
go for relief to my parents house even if i leave yours without a
protector for the one you left me if indeed he deserved that title
has i think more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you
as you are possessed of discernment i need say no more to you nor indeed
anselmo received this letter and from it he gathered that lothario had
already begun his task and that camilla must have replied to him as he
would have wished and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he
sent word to her not to leave his house on any account as he would very
shortly return camilla was astonished at anselmos reply which placed
her in greater perplexity than before for she neither dared to remain in
her own house nor yet to go to her parents for in remaining her virtue
was imperilled and in going she was opposing her husbands commands
finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her to remain
resolving not to fly from the presence of lothario that she might not
give food for gossip to her servants and she now began to regret having
written as she had to her husband fearing he might imagine that lothario
had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay aside
the respect he owed her but confident of her rectitude she put her trust
in god and in her own virtuous intentions with which she hoped to resist
in silence all the solicitations of lothario without saying anything to
her husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble and she
even began to consider how to excuse lothario to anselmo when he should
ask her what it was that induced her to write that letter with these
resolutions more honourable than judicious or effectual she remained
the next day listening to lothario who pressed his suit so strenuously
that camillas firmness began to waver and her virtue had enough to do
to come to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a
certain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of lothario had
awakened in her bosom lothario observed all this and it inflamed him
all the more in short he felt that while anselmos absence afforded time
and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress and so he
assailed her self esteem with praises of her beauty for there is nothing
that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair womens
vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery in fact with the
utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with such engines
that had camilla been of brass she must have fallen he wept he
entreated he promised he flattered he importuned he pretended with so
much feeling and apparent sincerity that he overthrew the virtuous
resolves of camilla and won the triumph he least expected and most longed
for camilla yielded camilla fell but what wonder if the friendship of
lothario could not stand firm a clear proof to us that the passion of
love is to be conquered only by flying from it and that no one should
engage in a struggle with an enemy so mighty for divine strength is
needed to overcome his human power leonela alone knew of her mistresss
weakness for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal
it lothario did not care to tell camilla the object anselmo had in view
nor that he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result
lest she should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and
without intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to
a few days later anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive what
it had lost that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized he
went at once to see lothario and found him at home they embraced each
other and anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his death
the tidings i have to give thee anselmo my friend said lothario are
that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown
of all good wives the words that i have addressed to her were borne away
on the wind my promises have been despised my presents have been
refused such feigned tears as i shed have been turned into open
ridicule in short as camilla is the essence of all beauty so is she
the treasure house where purity dwells and gentleness and modesty abide
with all the virtues that can confer praise honour and happiness upon a
woman take back thy money my friend here it is and i have had no need
to touch it for the chastity of camilla yields not to things so base as
gifts or promises be content anselmo and refrain from making further
proof and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts
and suspicions that are and may be entertained of women seek not to
plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments or with another
pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that heaven has
granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world but reckon
thyself now safe in port moor thyself with the anchor of sound
reflection and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt
which no nobility on earth can escape paying
anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of lothario and believed
them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle nevertheless he
begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking were it but for the sake
of curiosity and amusement though thenceforward he need not make use of
the same earnest endeavours as before all he wished him to do was to
write some verses to her praising her under the name of chloris for he
himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to
whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the
decorum due to her modesty and if lothario were unwilling to take the
trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself
that will not be necessary said lothario for the muses are not such
enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the
year do thou tell camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended
amour of mine as for the verses will make them and if not as good as
the subject deserves they shall be at least the best i can produce an
agreement to this effect was made between the friends the ill advised
one and the treacherous and anselmo returning to his house asked camilla
the question she already wondered he had not asked before what it was
that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him camilla replied
that it had seemed to her that lothario looked at her somewhat more
freely than when he had been at home but that now she was undeceived and
believed it to have been only her own imagination for lothario now
avoided seeing her or being alone with her anselmo told her she might
be quite easy on the score of that suspicion for he knew that lothario
was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under
the name of chloris and that even if he were not his fidelity and their
great friendship left no room for fear had not camilla however been
informed beforehand by lothario that this love for chloris was a
pretence and that he himself had told anselmo of it in order to be able
sometimes to give utterance to the praises of camilla herself no doubt
she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy but being
forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness
the next day as the three were at table anselmo asked lothario to recite
something of what he had composed for his mistress chloris for as
camilla did not know her he might safely say what he liked
even did she know her returned lothario i would hide nothing for
when a lover praises his ladys beauty and charges her with cruelty he
casts no imputation upon her fair name at any rate all i can say is
that yesterday i made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this chloris which
at midnight in the silence when the eyes
to chloris and to heaven is wont to rise
and when the light of day returning dyes
the portals of the east with tints of rose
and when the sun ascends his star girt throne
and on the earth pours down his midday beams
noon but renews my wailing and my tears
and with the night again goes up my moan
to me that neither heaven nor chloris hears
the sonnet pleased camilla and still more anselmo for he praised it and
said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so
manifest on which camilla said then all that love smitten poets say is
as poets they do not tell the truth replied lothario but as lovers
they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful
there is no doubt of that observed anselmo anxious to support and
uphold lotharios ideas with camilla who was as regardless of his design
as she was deep in love with lothario and so taking delight in anything
that was his and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for
their object and that she herself was the real chloris she asked him to
repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any
i do replied lothario but i do not think it as good as the first
one or more correctly speaking less bad but you can easily judge for
i know that i am doomed death is to me
dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying ere
my heart repented of its love for thee
it would be found that i thy image bear
deep graven in my breast for all to see
this like some holy relic do i prize
to save me from the fate my truth entails
truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes
where neither friendly port nor pole star shows
anselmo praised this second sonnet too as he had praised the first and
so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was
binding himself and making his dishonour secure for when lothario was
doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured and thus
each step that camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement she
mounted in his opinion towards the summit of virtue and fair fame
it so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid
camilla said to her i am ashamed to think my dear leonela how lightly
i have valued myself that i did not compel lothario to purchase by at
least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that i so
quickly yielded him of my own free will i fear that he will think ill of
my pliancy or lightness not considering the irresistible influence he
let not that trouble you my lady said leonela for it does not take
away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it
quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized nay they
are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice
they say also said camilla that what costs little is valued less
that saying does not hold good in your case replied leonela for
love as i have heard say sometimes flies and sometimes walks with this
one it runs with that it moves slowly some it cools others it burns
some it wounds others it slays it begins the course of its desires and
at the same moment completes and ends it in the morning it will lay
siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it for there is no
power that can resist it so what are you in dread of what do you fear
when the same must have befallen lothario love having chosen the absence
of my lord as the instrument for subduing you and it was absolutely
necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon without affording
the time to let anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be
left unfinished for love has no better agent for carrying out his
designs than opportunity and of opportunity he avails himself in all his
feats especially at the outset all this i know well myself more by
experience than by hearsay and some day senora i will enlighten you on
the subject for i am of your flesh and blood too moreover lady
camilla you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that
first you saw lotharios whole soul in his eyes in his sighs in his
words his promises and his gifts and by it and his good qualities
perceived how worthy he was of your love this then being the case let
not these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination but be
assured that lothario prizes you as you do him and rest content and
satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth
and merit that has taken you and one that has not only the four ss that
they say true lovers ought to have but a complete alphabet only listen
to me and you will see how i can repeat it by rote he is to my eyes and
thinking amiable brave courteous distinguished elegant fond gay
honourable illustrious loyal manly noble open polite quickwitted
rich and the ss according to the saying and then tender veracious x
does not suit him for it is a rough letter y has been given already
camilla laughed at her maids alphabet and perceived her to be more
experienced in love affairs than she said which she admitted confessing
to camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of
the same city camilla was uneasy at this dreading lest it might prove
the means of endangering her honour and asked whether her intrigue had
gone beyond words and she with little shame and much effrontery said it
had for certain it is that ladies imprudences make servants shameless
who when they see their mistresses make a false step think nothing of
going astray themselves or of its being known all that camilla could do
was to entreat leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she
called her lover and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they
should come to the knowledge of anselmo or of lothario leonela said she
would but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed camillas
apprehension of losing her reputation through her means for this
abandoned and bold leonela as soon as she perceived that her mistresss
demeanour was not what it was wont to be had the audacity to introduce
her lover into the house confident that even if her mistress saw him she
would not dare to expose him for the sins of mistresses entail this
mischief among others they make themselves the slaves of their own
servants and are obliged to hide their laxities and depravities as was
the case with camilla who though she perceived not once but many times
that leonela was with her lover in some room of the house not only did
not dare to chide her but afforded her opportunities for concealing him
and removed all difficulties lest he should be seen by her husband she
was unable however to prevent him from being seen on one occasion as
he sallied forth at daybreak by lothario who not knowing who he was
at first took him for a spectre but as soon as he saw him hasten away
muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and
cautiously he rejected this foolish idea and adopted another which
would have been the ruin of all had not camilla found a remedy it did
not occur to lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an
untimely hour from anselmos house could have entered it on leonelas
account nor did he even remember there was such a person as leonela all
he thought was that as camilla had been light and yielding with him so
she had been with another for this further penalty the erring womans
sin brings with it that her honour is distrusted even by him to whose
overtures and persuasions she has yielded and he believes her to have
surrendered more easily to others and gives implicit credence to every
suspicion that comes into his mind all lotharios good sense seems to
have failed him at this juncture all his prudent maxims escaped his
memory for without once reflecting rationally and without more ado in
his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage that gnawed his
heart and dying to revenge himself upon camilla who had done him no
wrong before anselmo had risen he hastened to him and said to him
know anselmo that for several days past i have been struggling with
myself striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or
right that i should conceal from thee know that camillas fortress has
surrendered and is ready to submit to my will and if i have been slow to
reveal this fact to thee it was in order to see if it were some light
caprice of hers or if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love i
began to make to her with thy permission was made with a serious
intention i thought too that she if she were what she ought to be
and what we both believed her would have ere this given thee information
of my addresses but seeing that she delays i believe the truth of the
promise she has given me that the next time thou art absent from the
house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels are
kept and it was true that camilla used to meet him there but i do not
wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance for the sin is as yet
only committed in intention and camillas may change perhaps between
this and the appointed time and repentance spring up in its place as
hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part follow
and observe this that i will give thee now so that without mistake and
with mature deliberation thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem
the best course pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou
hast been wont to do on other occasions and contrive to hide thyself in
the closet for the tapestries and other things there afford great
facilities for thy concealment and then thou wilt see with thine own
eyes and i with mine what camillas purpose may be and if it be a guilty
one which may be feared rather than expected with silence prudence
and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for
anselmo was amazed overwhelmed and astounded at the words of lothario
which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them for he
now looked upon camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of
lothario and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory he
remained silent for a considerable time looking on the ground with fixed
gaze and at length said thou hast behaved lothario as i expected of
thy friendship i will follow thy advice in everything do as thou wilt
and keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so
lothario gave him his word but after leaving him he repented altogether
of what he had said to him perceiving how foolishly he had acted as he
might have revenged himself upon camilla in some less cruel and degrading
way he cursed his want of sense condemned his hasty resolution and
knew not what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready
escape from it at last he decided upon revealing all to camilla and as
there was no want of opportunity for doing so he found her alone the
same day but she as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him
said lothario my friend i must tell thee i have a sorrow in my heart
which fills it so that it seems ready to burst and it will be a wonder
if it does not for the audacity of leonela has now reached such a pitch
that every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains
with him till morning at the expense of my reputation inasmuch as it is
open to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such
unseasonable hours but what distresses me is that i cannot punish or
chide her for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me
silent about hers while i am dreading that some catastrophe will come of
as camilla said this lothario at first imagined it was some device to
delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was leonelas
lover and not hers but when he saw how she wept and suffered and begged
him to help her he became convinced of the truth and the conviction
completed his confusion and remorse however he told camilla not to
distress herself as he would take measures to put a stop to the
insolence of leonela at the same time he told her what driven by the
fierce rage of jealousy he had said to anselmo and how he had arranged
to hide himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little
she preserved her fidelity to him and he entreated her pardon for this
madness and her advice as to how to repair it and escape safely from
the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him camilla
was struck with alarm at hearing what lothario said and with much anger
and great good sense she reproved him and rebuked his base design and
the foolish and mischievous resolution he had made but as woman has by
nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil though it is apt to
fail when she sets herself deliberately to reason camilla on the spur of
the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance
irremediable and told lothario to contrive that the next day anselmo
should conceal himself in the place he mentioned for she hoped from his
concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the
future without any apprehension and without revealing her purpose to him
entirely she charged him to be careful as soon as anselmo was concealed
to come to her when leonela should call him and to all she said to him
to answer as he would have answered had he not known that anselmo was
listening lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully so that
he might with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw
i tell you said camilla there is nothing to take care of except to
answer me what i shall ask you for she did not wish to explain to him
beforehand what she meant to do fearing lest he should be unwilling to
follow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one and should try or
lothario then retired and the next day anselmo under pretence of going
to his friends country house took his departure and then returned to
conceal himself which he was able to do easily as camilla and leonela
took care to give him the opportunity and so he placed himself in hiding
in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who
expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes and
found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he
possessed in his beloved camilla having made sure of anselmos being in
his hiding place camilla and leonela entered the closet and the instant
she set foot within it camilla said with a deep sigh ah dear leonela
would it not be better before i do what i am unwilling you should know
lest you should seek to prevent it that you should take anselmos dagger
that i have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine but
no there is no reason why i should suffer the punishment of anothers
fault i will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of
lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a
design so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend
and of my honour go to the window leonela and call him for no doubt
he is in the street waiting to carry out his vile project but mine
cruel it may be but honourable shall be carried out first
ah senora said the crafty leonela who knew her part what is it you
want to do with this dagger can it be that you mean to take your own
life or lotharios for whichever you mean to do it will lead to the
loss of your reputation and good name it is better to dissemble your
wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now
and finding us alone consider senora we are weak women and he is a
man and determined and as he comes with such a base purpose blind and
urged by passion perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may
do what will be worse for you than taking your life ill betide my
master anselmo for giving such authority in his house to this shameless
fellow and supposing you kill him senora as i suspect you mean to do
what shall we do with him when he is dead
what my friend replied camilla we shall leave him for anselmo to
bury him for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his own
infamy under ground summon him make haste for all the time i delay in
taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty
anselmo was listening to all this and every word that camilla uttered
made him change his mind but when he heard that it was resolved to kill
lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert such
a disaster but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold
and virtuous he restrained himself intending to come forth in time to
prevent the deed at this moment camilla throwing herself upon a bed
that was close by swooned away and leonela began to weep bitterly
exclaiming woe is me that i should be fated to have dying here in my
arms the flower of virtue upon earth the crown of true wives the
pattern of chastity with more to the same effect so that anyone who
heard her would have taken her for the most tender hearted and faithful
handmaid in the world and her mistress for another persecuted penelope
camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to
herself she said why do you not go leonela to call hither that
friend the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night
concealed away run haste speed lest the fire of my wrath burn itself
out with delay and the righteous vengeance that i hope for melt away in
i am just going to call him senora said leonela but you must first
give me that dagger lest while i am gone you should by means of it give
cause to all who love you to weep all their lives
go in peace dear leonela i will not do so said camilla for rash
and foolish as i may be to your mind in defending my honour i am not
going to be so much so as that lucretia who they say killed herself
without having done anything wrong and without having first killed him
on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay i shall die if i am to die but
it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep
over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to
leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon lothario
but at last she went and while awaiting her return camilla continued as
if speaking to herself good god would it not have been more prudent to
have repulsed lothario as i have done many a time before than to allow
him as i am now doing to think me unchaste and vile even for the short
time i must wait until i undeceive him no doubt it would have been
better but i should not be avenged nor the honour of my husband
vindicated should he find so clear and easy an escape from the strait
into which his depravity has led him let the traitor pay with his life
for the temerity of his wanton wishes and let the world know if haply
it shall ever come to know that camilla not only preserved her
allegiance to her husband but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong
him still i think it might be better to disclose this to anselmo but
then i have called his attention to it in the letter i wrote to him in
the country and if he did nothing to prevent the mischief i there
pointed out to him i suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and
trustfulness he would not and could not believe that any thought against
his honour could harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend nor indeed
did i myself believe it for many days nor should i have ever believed it
if his insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open
presents lavish promises and ceaseless tears but why do i argue thus
does a bold determination stand in need of arguments surely not then
traitors avaunt vengeance to my aid let the false one come approach
advance die yield up his life and then befall what may pure i came to
him whom heaven bestowed upon me pure i shall leave him and at the
worst bathed in my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest
friend that friendship ever saw in the world and as she uttered these
words she paced the room holding the unsheathed dagger with such
irregular and disordered steps and such gestures that one would have
supposed her to have lost her senses and taken her for some violent
anselmo hidden behind some tapestries where he had concealed himself
beheld and was amazed at all and already felt that what he had seen and
heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions and he would
have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by lotharios coming
were dispensed with as he feared some sudden mishap but as he was on
the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and undeceive
his wife he paused as he saw leonela returning leading lothario camilla
when she saw him drawing a long line in front of her on the floor with
the dagger said to him lothario pay attention to what i say to thee
if by any chance thou darest to cross this line thou seest or even
approach it the instant i see thee attempt it that same instant will i
pierce my bosom with this dagger that i hold in my hand and before thou
answerest me a word desire thee to listen to a few from me and
afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee first i desire thee to
tell me lothario if thou knowest my husband anselmo and in what light
thou regardest him and secondly i desire to know if thou knowest me too
answer me this without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt
answer for they are no riddles i put to thee
lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when camilla
directed him to make anselmo hide himself he understood what she intended
to do and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and promptly
that between them they made the imposture look more true than truth so
he answered her thus i did not think fair camilla that thou wert
calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with which i come
but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so thou mightst
have put it off still longer for the longing for happiness gives the
more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining it but lest thou
shouldst say that i do not answer thy questions i say that i know thy
husband anselmo and that we have known each other from our earliest
years i will not speak of what thou too knowest of our friendship that
i may not compel myself to testify against the wrong that love the
mighty excuse for greater errors makes me inflict upon him thee i know
and hold in the same estimation as he does for were it not so i had not
for a lesser prize acted in opposition to what i owe to my station and
the holy laws of true friendship now broken and violated by me through
if thou dost confess that returned camilla mortal enemy of all that
rightly deserves to be loved with what face dost thou dare to come
before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on
whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou him but woe is me i
now comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest
to thyself it must have been some freedom of mine for i will not call
it immodesty as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention but
from some heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence
when they think they have no occasion for reserve but tell me traitor
when did i by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken
in thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes when were not thy
professions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked when
were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or
accepted but as i am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the
attempt to win love unsustained by some hope i am willing to attribute
to myself the blame of thy assurance for no doubt some thoughtlessness
of mine has all this time fostered thy hopes and therefore will i punish
myself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves and that
thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself i cannot possibly be
otherwise to thee i have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice
i mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband wronged by
thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of and by me too through
want of caution in avoiding every occasion if i have given any of
encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs once more i say the
suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these
lawless thoughts in thee is what causes me most distress and what i
desire most to punish with my own hands for were any other instrument of
punishment employed my error might become perhaps more widely known but
before i do so in my death i mean to inflict death and take with me one
that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge i hope for and have
for i shall see wheresoever it may be that i go the penalty awarded by
inflexible unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so
as she uttered these words with incredible energy and swiftness she flew
upon lothario with the naked dagger so manifestly bent on burying it in
his breast that he was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were
real or feigned for he was obliged to have recourse to all his skill and
strength to prevent her from striking him and with such reality did she
act this strange farce and mystification that to give it a colour of
truth she determined to stain it with her own blood for perceiving or
pretending that she could not wound lothario she said fate it seems
will not grant my just desire complete satisfaction but it will not be
able to keep me from satisfying it partially at least and making an
effort to free the hand with the dagger which lothario held in his grasp
she released it and directing the point to a place where it could not
inflict a deep wound she plunged it into her left side high up close to
the shoulder and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a
leonela and lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe and
seeing camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they were
still uncertain as to the true nature of the act lothario terrified and
breathless ran in haste to pluck out the dagger but when he saw how
slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more admired
the subtlety coolness and ready wit of the fair camilla and the better
to support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and doleful
lamentations over her body as if she were dead invoking maledictions not
only on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him in
such a position and knowing that his friend anselmo heard him he spoke
in such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than for
camilla even though he supposed her dead leonela took her up in her
arms and laid her on the bed entreating lothario to go in quest of some
one to attend to her wound in secret and at the same time asking his
advice and opinion as to what they should say to anselmo about his ladys
wound if he should chance to return before it was healed he replied they
might say what they liked for he was not in a state to give advice that
would be of any use all he could tell her was to try and stanch the
blood as he was going where he should never more be seen and with every
appearance of deep grief and sorrow he left the house but when he found
himself alone and where there was nobody to see him he crossed himself
unceasingly lost in wonder at the adroitness of camilla and the
consistent acting of leonela he reflected how convinced anselmo would be
that he had a second portia for a wife and he looked forward anxiously
to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood and truth the
leonela as he told her stanched her ladys blood which was no more
than sufficed to support her deception and washing the wound with a
little wine she bound it up to the best of her skill talking all the
time she was tending her in a strain that even if nothing else had been
said before would have been enough to assure anselmo that he had in
camilla a model of purity to leonelas words camilla added her own
calling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit since she had not enough
at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life she so
much loathed she asked her attendants advice as to whether or not she
ought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened but the
other bade her say nothing about it as she would lay upon him the
obligation of taking vengeance on lothario which he could not do but at
great risk to himself and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her
husband provocation to quarrel but on the contrary to remove it as far
camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would follow
her advice but at any rate it would be well to consider how she was to
explain the wound to anselmo for he could not help seeing it to which
leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even in jest
how then can i know my dear said camilla for i should not dare to
forge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it if we can think
of no escape from this difficulty it will be better to tell him the
plain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story
be not uneasy senora said leonela between this and to morrow i will
think of what we must say to him and perhaps the wound being where it is
it can be hidden from his sight and heaven will be pleased to aid us in
a purpose so good and honourable compose yourself senora and endeavour
to calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated and leave the
rest to my care and gods who always supports good intentions
anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out
the tragedy of the death of his honour which the performers acted with
such wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the
realities of the parts they played he longed for night and an
opportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend
lothario and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he
had gained in having established his wifes purity both mistress and
maid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away and taking
advantage of it he made his escape and at once went in quest of
lothario and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him when
he found him and the things he said to him in the joy of his heart and
the praises he bestowed upon camilla all which lothario listened to
without being able to show any pleasure for he could not forget how
deceived his friend was and how dishonourably he had wronged him and
though anselmo could see that lothario was not glad still he imagined it
was only because he had left camilla wounded and had been himself the
cause of it and so among other things he told him not to be distressed
about camillas accident for as they had agreed to hide it from him
the wound was evidently trifling and that being so he had no cause for
fear but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him
seeing that by his means and adroitness he found himself raised to the
greatest height of happiness that he could have ventured to hope for and
desired no better pastime than making verses in praise of camilla that
would preserve her name for all time to come lothario commended his
purpose and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so
and so anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be
in the world he himself persuaded he was conducting the instrument of
his glory led home by the hand him who had been the utter destruction of
his good name whom camilla received with averted countenance though
with smiles in her heart the deception was carried on for some time
until at the end of a few months fortune turned her wheel and the guilt
which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad
and anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill advised curiosity
which treats of the heroic and prodigious battle don quixote had with
certain skins of red wine and brings the novel of the ill advised
there remained but little more of the novel to be read when sancho panza
burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where don quixote was
lying shouting run sirs quick and help my master who is in the
thick of the toughest and stiffest battle i ever laid eyes on by the
living god he has given the giant the enemy of my lady the princess
micomicona such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it
what are you talking about brother said the curate pausing as he was
about to read the remainder of the novel are you in your senses
sancho how the devil can it be as you say when the giant is two
here they heard a loud noise in the chamber and don quixote shouting
out stand thief brigand villain now i have got thee and thy
scimitar shall not avail thee and then it seemed as though he were
dont stop to listen said sancho but go in and part them or help my
master though there is no need of that now for no doubt the giant is
dead by this time and giving account to god of his past wicked life for
i saw the blood flowing on the ground and the head cut off and fallen on
one side and it is as big as a large wine skin
may i die said the landlord at this if don quixote or don devil has
not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his
beds head and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for
blood and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him and
there they found don quixote in the strangest costume in the world he
was in his shirt which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs
completely and was six fingers shorter behind his legs were very long
and lean covered with hair and anything but clean on his head he had a
little greasy red cap that belonged to the host round his left arm he
had rolled the blanket of the bed to which sancho for reasons best
known to himself owed a grudge and in his right hand he held his
unsheathed sword with which he was slashing about on all sides uttering
exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant and the best of
it was his eyes were not open for he was fast asleep and dreaming that
he was doing battle with the giant for his imagination was so wrought
upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish that it made him dream
he had already reached the kingdom of micomicon and was engaged in
combat with his enemy and believing he was laying on the giant he had
given so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of
wine on seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on don
quixote and with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way
that if cardenio and the curate had not dragged him off he would have
brought the war of the giant to an end but in spite of all the poor
gentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of cold water
from the well and flung it with one dash all over his body on which don
quixote woke up but not so completely as to understand what was the
matter dorothea seeing how short and slight his attire was would not
