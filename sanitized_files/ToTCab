you useful business miss manette your mother took this course with
you and when she died i believe broken hearted having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father she left you at two years old
to grow to be blooming beautiful and happy without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison or wasted there through many lingering years
as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the
flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have
you know that your parents had no great possession and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you there has been no new
discovery of money or of any other property but 
he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped the expression in the
forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which was
now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror
but he has been been found he is alive greatly changed it is too
probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the best
still alive your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in paris and we are going there i to identify him if i can you to
restore him to life love duty rest comfort
a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his she said in a
low distinct awe stricken voice as if she were saying it in a dream
i am going to see his ghost it will be his ghost not him
mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm there there
there see now see now the best and the worst are known to you now
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair
sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dear side
she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free i
have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me
only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention he has been found under
another name his own long forgotten or long concealed it would be
worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly
held prisoner it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries
because it would be dangerous better not to mention the subject
anywhere or in any way and to remove him for a while at all
events out of france even i safe as an englishman and even
tellsons important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of
the matter i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it this is a secret service altogether my credentials entries
and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to life
which may mean anything but what is the matter she doesnt notice a
perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair she
sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open and fixed
upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead so close was her hold upon his arm that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her therefore he called
a wild looking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observed to
be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight fitting fashion and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good measure too
or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his chest and sending him
i really think this must be a man was mr lorrys breathless
reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall
why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn servants
why dont you go and fetch things instead of standing there staring
at me i am not so much to look at am i why dont you go and fetch
things ill let you know if you dont bring smelling salts cold
there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill and
gentleness calling her my precious and my bird and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care
and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorry
couldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening her
to death look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold hands do
mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler
sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know something
not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
i hope she will do well now said mr lorry
no thanks to you in brown if she does my darling pretty
i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility that you accompany miss manette to france
a likely thing too replied the strong woman if it was ever
intended that i should go across salt water do you suppose providence
would have cast my lot in an island
this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorry withdrew to
a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street the
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had tumbled
out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine shop shattered like a walnut shell
all the people within reach had suspended their business or their
idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine the rough irregular
stones of the street pointing every way and designed one might have
thought expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them
had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded each by its own
jostling group or crowd according to its size some men kneeled down
made scoops of their two hands joined and sipped or tried to help
women who bent over their shoulders to sip before the wine had all
run out between their fingers others men and women dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware or even with
handkerchiefs from womens heads which were squeezed dry into infants
mouths others made small mud embankments to stem the wine as it ran
others directed by lookers on up at high windows darted here and
there to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed
pieces of the cask licking and even champing the moister wine rotted
fragments with eager relish there was no drainage to carry off the
wine and not only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up
along with it that there might have been a scavenger in the street
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices voices of men women
and children resounded in the street while this wine game lasted there
was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness there was a
special companionship in it an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one which led especially among the
luckier or lighter hearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of healths
shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing a dozen
together when the wine was gone and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers these
demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out the man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting set it in
motion again the women who had left on a door step the little pot of
hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes or in those of her child returned to it men
with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous faces who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars moved away to descend again and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine
the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilled it had
stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many
wooden shoes the hands of the man who sawed the wood left red marks
on the billets and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again
those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth and one tall joker so besmirched his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees blood
the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the
street stones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there
and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was
heavy cold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence nobles of great power all of them
but most especially the last samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young shivered at every corner
passed in and out at every doorway looked from every window fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook the mill which
had worked them down was the mill that grinds young people old the
children had ancient faces and grave voices and upon them and upon the
grown faces and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh
was the sigh hunger it was prevalent everywhere hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys and started up from the filthy street that had no offal
among its refuse of anything to eat hunger was the inscription on the
bakers shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread at the sausage shop in every dead dog preparation that
was offered for sale hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant
its abiding place was in all things fitted to it a narrow winding
street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets
diverging all peopled by rags and nightcaps and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill in the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay depressed and
slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wanting among them nor
compressed lips white with what they suppressed nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows rope they mused about enduring or
inflicting the trade signs and they were almost as many as the shops
were all grim illustrations of want the butcher and the porkman
painted up only the leanest scrags of meat the baker the coarsest of
meagre loaves the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine shops
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer and were
gloweringly confidential together nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition save tools and weapons but the cutlers knives
and axes were sharp and bright the smiths hammers were heavy and the
gunmakers stock was murderous the crippling stones of the pavement
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but
broke off abruptly at the doors the kennel to make amends ran down
the middle of the street when it ran at all which was only after heavy
rains and then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses across
the streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down and lighted
and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea indeed they were at sea and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest
for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger so
long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the darkness of their
condition but the time was not come yet and every wind that blew over
france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain for the birds fine of
the wine shop was a corner shop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wine shop had stood outside
it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine its not my affair said he with a final shrug
of the shoulders the people from the market did it let them bring
there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke
say then my gaspard what do you do there
the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often
the way with his tribe it missed its mark and completely failed as is
what now are you a subject for the mad hospital said the wine shop
keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it why do you write
in the public streets is there tell me thou is there no other place
in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally
perhaps not upon the jokers heart the joker rapped it with his
own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand and held out a joker of an extremely not to say wolfishly
put it on put it on said the other call wine wine and finish
there with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers
dress such as it was quite deliberately as having dirtied the hand on
his account and then recrossed the road and entered the wine shop
this wine shop keeper was a bull necked martial looking man of thirty
and he should have been of a hot temperament for although it was a
bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over his shoulder
his shirt sleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply curling short dark hair he was a dark man altogether with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them good humoured looking on
the whole but implacable looking too evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose a man not desirable to be met rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side for nothing would turn
madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand
heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure of
manner there was a character about madame defarge from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided madame defarge being
sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large
earrings her knitting was before her but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick thus engaged with her right elbow supported
by her left hand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but
coughed just one grain of cough this in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers for any new customer who had dropped in while
the wine shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seated in
a corner other company were there two playing cards two playing
dominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine as he passed behind the counter he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man
what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieur defarge
but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter
how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defarge is
when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge
picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line
it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur
defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or
of anything but black bread and death is it not so jacques
at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still
using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of
cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line
the last of the three now said his say as he put down his empty
ah so much the worse a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques am i
you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge
this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows up and
hold then true muttered her husband gentlemen my wife
the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three
flourishes she acknowledged their homage by bending her head and
giving them a quick look then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine shop took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her good day the chamber furnished bachelor fashion that you
wished to see and were inquiring for when i stepped out is on the
fifth floor the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here pointing with his hand near to the window of
my establishment but now that i remember one of you has already been
there and can show the way gentlemen adieu
they paid for their wine and left the place the eyes of monsieur
defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word
willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to
their conference was very short but very decided almost at the first
word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive it had
not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady and they too went out madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and saw nothing
mr jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wine shop thus
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before it opened from a stinking little black courtyard
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses inhabited
by a great number of people in the gloomy tile paved entry to the
gloomy tile paved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master and put her hand to his lips it was
a gentle action but not at all gently done a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds he had no good humour
in his face nor any openness of aspect left but had become a secret
it is very high it is a little difficult better to begin slowly
thus monsieur defarge in a stern voice to mr lorry as they began
alone god help him who should be with him said the other in the
of his own necessity as he was when i first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if i would take him and at my peril be
discreet as he was then so he is now
the keeper of the wine shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand
and mutter a tremendous curse no direct answer could have been half so
forcible mr lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavier as he and his
such a staircase with its accessories in the older and more crowded
parts of paris would be bad enough now but at that time it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building that is to say
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase left its own heap of refuse on its own landing besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows the uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have polluted
the air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable through such an atmosphere by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison the way lay yielding to his own disturbance of mind and to
his young companions agitation which became greater every instant mr
jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted seemed to escape and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in through the rusted bars tastes rather than glimpses were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood and nothing within range nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre dame had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations
at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped for the
third time there was yet an upper staircase of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions to be ascended before the garret story
was reached the keeper of the wine shop always going a little in
advance and always going on the side which mr lorry took as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady turned himself about
here and carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
the door is locked then my friend said mr lorry surprised
ay yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge
you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired
i think it necessary to turn the key monsieur defarge whispered it
why because he has lived so long locked up that he would be
frightened rave tear himself to pieces die come to i know not what
is it possible repeated defarge bitterly yes and a beautiful
world we live in when it is possible and when many other such things
are possible and not only possible but done done see you under
that sky there every day long live the devil let us go on
this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word
of it had reached the young ladys ears but by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety
and above all such dread and terror that mr lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance
courage dear miss courage business the worst will be over in a
moment it is but passing the room door and the worst is over then
all the good you bring to him all the relief all the happiness you
bring to him begin let our good friend here assist you on that side
thats well friend defarge come now business business
they went up slowly and softly the staircase was short and they were
soon at the top there as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at
once in sight of three men whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged through some chinks or holes in the wall on hearing
footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieur
defarge leave us good boys we have business here
the three glided by and went silently down
there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of
the wine shop going straight to this one when they were left alone mr
lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger
do you make a show of monsieur manette
i show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few
who are the few how do you choose them
i choose them as real men of my name jacques is my name to whom the
sight is likely to do good enough you are english that is another
thing stay there if you please a little moment
with an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in
through the crevice in the wall soon raising his head again he struck
twice or thrice upon the door evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there with the same intention he drew the key across it
three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned
the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the
room and said something a faint voice answered something little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side
he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter mr lorry
got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held her for he
a a a business business he urged with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek come in come in
i am afraid of it she answered shuddering
rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room he sat her
down just within the door and held her clinging to him
defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside
took out the key again and held it in his hand all this he did
methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was he stopped there and faced round
the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim
and dark for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the
roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any
other door of french construction to exclude the cold one half of this
door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way
such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it
was difficult on first coming in to see anything and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity yet work of that kind was being
done in the garret for with his back towards the door and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine shop stood looking at
him a white haired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very
good day said monsieur defarge looking down at the white head that
it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation as if it were at a distance
you are still hard at work i see
after a long silence the head was lifted for another moment and the
voice replied yes i am working this time a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again
the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful it was not the
faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it its deplorable peculiarity was that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse it was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago so entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain so sunken and
suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground so expressive
it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die
some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked
up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical
perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood was not yet empty
i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker
to let in a little more light here you can bear a little more
the shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listening
at the floor on one side of him then similarly at the floor on the
other side of him then upward at the speaker
i must bear it if you let it in laying the palest shadow of a
the opened half door was opened a little further and secured at that
angle for the time a broad ray of light fell into the garret and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his
labour his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench he had a white beard raggedly cut but not very
long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes the hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really
otherwise but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body
to be withered and worn he and his old canvas frock and his loose
stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion
from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment yellow that it would have been hard to say which was which
he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones
of it seemed transparent so he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze
pausing in his work he never looked at the figure before him without
first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spoke without
first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak
are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day asked defarge
do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to day
i cant say that i mean to i suppose so i dont know
but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again
mr lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door when
he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker
looked up he showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour and then
the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe the
look and the action had occupied but an instant
you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge
the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his
come said defarge here is monsieur who knows a well made shoe when
he sees one show him that shoe you are working at take it monsieur
tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name
there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied
i forget what it was you asked me what did you say
i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieurs
it is a ladys shoe it is a young ladys walking shoe it is in the
present mode i never saw the mode i have had a pattern in my hand he
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride
now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and
so on in regular changes without a moments intermission the task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or
endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a
with a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work
you are not a shoemaker by trade said mr lorry looking steadfastly
his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground
i am not a shoemaker by trade no i was not a shoemaker by trade i i
learnt it here i taught myself i asked leave to 
he lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time his eyes came slowly back at last to the face
from which they had wandered when they rested on it he started and
resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a
i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficulty after
a long while and i have made shoes ever since
as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him mr
lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face
monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me
the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the
monsieur manette mr lorry laid his hand upon defarges arm do you
remember nothing of this man look at him look at me is there no old
banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your
as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at mr
lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him they were overclouded
again they were fainter they were gone but they had been there and
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where
she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him but which were now extending towards him
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast and love it back to life and hope so exactly was the expression
repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her
darkness had fallen on him in its place he looked at the two less and
less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way finally with a deep long sigh he
took the shoe up and resumed his work
have you recognised him monsieur asked defarge in a whisper
yes for a moment at first i thought it quite hopeless but i have
unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew so
well hush let us draw further back hush
she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on
which he sat there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
not a word was spoken not a sound was made she stood like a spirit
beside him and he bent over his work
it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand for his shoemakers knife it lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood he had taken it up and was
stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress he
raised them and saw her face the two spectators started forward
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand she had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife though they had
he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began
to form some words though no sound proceeded from them by degrees in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say
with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her
lips and kissed them to him then clasped them on her breast as if she
not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench
beside him he recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm a strange
thrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame he
laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her
her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed
aside and fell down over her neck advancing his hand by little and
little he took it up and looked at it in the midst of the action
he went astray and with another deep sigh fell to work at his
but not for long releasing his arm she laid her hand upon his
shoulder after looking doubtfully at it two or three times as if to
be sure that it was really there he laid down his work put his hand
to his neck and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it he opened this carefully on his knee and it contained
a very little quantity of hair not more than one or two long golden
hairs which he had in some old day wound off upon his finger
he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at it it is
the same how can it be when was it how was it
as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too he turned her full to the
she had laid her head upon my shoulder that night when i was summoned
out she had a fear of my going though i had none and when i was
brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve you will
leave me them they can never help me to escape in the body though they
may in the spirit those were the words i said i remember them very
he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it
but when he did find spoken words for it they came to him coherently
once more the two spectators started as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness but she sat perfectly still in his grasp and only
said in a low voice i entreat you good gentlemen do not come near
his hands released her as he uttered this cry and went up to his white
hair which they tore in a frenzy it died out as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast but he still looked at her and
no no no you are too young too blooming it cant be see what the
prisoner is these are not the hands she knew this is not the face
she knew this is not a voice she ever heard no no she was and he
was before the slow years of the north tower ages ago what is your
hailing his softened tone and manner his daughter fell upon her knees
before him with her appealing hands upon his breast
o sir at another time you shall know my name and who my mother was
and who my father and how i never knew their hard hard history but i
cannot tell you at this time and i cannot tell you here all that i may
tell you here and now is that i pray to you to touch me and to bless
me kiss me kiss me o my dear my dear
his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him
if you hear in my voice i dont know that it is so but i hope it
is if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears weep for it weep for it if you touch in
touching my hair anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free weep for it weep for it if when
i hint to you of a home that is before us where i will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service i bring back the
remembrance of a home long desolate while your poor heart pined away
she held him closer round the neck and rocked him on her breast like a
if when i tell you dearest dear that your agony is over and that i
have come here to take you from it and that we go to england to be at
peace and at rest i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste
and of our native france so wicked to you weep for it weep for it and
if when i shall tell you of my name and of my father who is living
and of my mother who is dead you learn that i have to kneel to my
honoured father and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me weep for it weep for it weep
for her then and for me good gentlemen thank god i feel his sacred
tears upon my face and his sobs strike against my heart o see thank
he had sunk in her arms and his face dropped on her breast a sight so
touching yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it that the two beholders covered their faces
when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms emblem to humanity of the rest and silence into which the storm
called life must hush at last they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground he had gradually dropped to the floor and lay
there in a lethargy worn out she had nestled down with him that his
head might lie upon her arm and her hair drooping over him curtained
if without disturbing him she said raising her hand to mr lorry as
he stooped over them after repeated blowings of his nose all could be
arranged for our leaving paris at once so that from the very door he
but consider is he fit for the journey asked mr lorry
more fit for that i think than to remain in this city so dreadful to
it is true said defarge who was kneeling to look on and hear more
than that monsieur manette is for all reasons best out of france
say shall i hire a carriage and post horses
thats business said mr lorry resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners and if business is to be done i had better do it
then be so kind urged miss manette as to leave us here you see how
composed he has become and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
now why should you be if you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption i do not doubt that you will find him when you come back
as quiet as you leave him in any case i will take care of him until
you return and then we will remove him straight
both mr lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course and
in favour of one of them remaining but as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to but travelling papers and as time pressed
for the day was drawing to an end it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done and hurrying away
then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him the darkness
deepened and deepened and they both lay quiet until a light gleamed
mr lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey and
had brought with them besides travelling cloaks and wrappers bread and
meat wine and hot coffee monsieur defarge put this provender and the
lamp he carried on the shoemakers bench there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed and he and mr lorry roused the captive and
no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind in
the scared blank wonder of his face whether he knew what had happened
whether he recollected what they had said to him whether he knew that
he was free were questions which no sagacity could have solved they
tried speaking to him but he was so confused and so very slow to
answer that they took fright at his bewilderment and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more he had a wild lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands that had not been seen
in him before yet he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughters voice and invariably turned to it when she spoke
in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink and put on the cloak
and other wrappings that they gave him to wear he readily responded to
his daughters drawing her arm through his and took and kept her hand
they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lamp mr
lorry closing the little procession they had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped and stared at the roof and
you remember the place my father you remember coming up here
but before she could repeat the question he murmured an answer as if
remember no i dont remember it was so very long ago
that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house was apparent to them they heard him mutter
one hundred and five north tower and when he looked about him it
evidently was for the strong fortress walls which had long encompassed
him on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread as being in expectation of a drawbridge and when there was
no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street he
dropped his daughters hand and clasped his head again
no crowd was about the door no people were discernible at any of the
many windows not even a chance passerby was in the street an unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there only one soul was to be seen and
that was madame defarge who leaned against the door post knitting and
the prisoner had got into a coach and his daughter had followed
him when mr lorrys feet were arrested on the step by his asking
miserably for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes madame
defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them and
went knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard she quickly
brought them down and handed them in and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door post knitting and saw nothing
