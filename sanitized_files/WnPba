hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued prince
andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask you to make
me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall remain a
secret and should you find that you do not love me or should you come
to love said prince andrew with an unnatural smile
why do you say that natasha interrupted him you know that from the
very day you first came to otradnoe i have loved you she cried quite
in a year you will learn to know yourself
a whole year natasha repeated suddenly only now realizing that the
marriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a
prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay
and cant it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply but
his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision
its awful oh its awful awful natasha suddenly cried and again
burst into sobs i shall die waiting a year its impossible its
awful she looked into her lovers face and saw in it a look of
no no ill do anything she said suddenly checking her tears i am
the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs as natashas
no betrothal ceremony took place and natashas engagement to bolkonski
was not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said that as he
was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it
that he had given his word and bound himself forever but that he did
not wish to bind natasha and gave her perfect freedom if after six
months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to
reject him naturally neither natasha nor her parents wished to hear of
this but prince andrew was firm he came every day to the rostovs but
did not behave to natasha as an affianced lover he did not use the
familiar thou but said you to her and kissed only her hand after
their engagement quite different intimate and natural relations
sprang up between them it was as if they had not known each other till
now both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet
they were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quite
different beings then they were artificial now natural and sincere at
first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrew
he seemed a man from another world and for a long time natasha trained
the family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he only
appeared to be different but was really just like all of them and that
she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be after a few days
they grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presence
pursued their usual way of life in which he took his part he could
talk about rural economy with the count fashions with the countess and
natasha and about albums and fancywork with sonya sometimes the
household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their
wonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there had
been of it prince andrews coming to otradnoe and their coming to
petersburg and the likeness between natasha and prince andrew which her
nurse had noticed on his first visit and andrews encounter with
nicholas in 1805 and many other incidents betokening that it had to be
in the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple often when all sitting
together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up and go
away and the couple left alone still remained silent they rarely
spoke of their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it natasha shared this as she did all his feelings which she
constantly divined once she began questioning him about his son prince
andrew blushed as he often did now natasha particularly liked it in
him and said that his son would not live with them
why not asked natasha in a frightened tone
i cannot take him away from his grandfather and besides
how i should have loved him said natasha immediately guessing his
thought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault
sometimes the old count would come up kiss prince andrew and ask his
advice about petyas education or nicholas service the old countess
sighed as she looked at them sonya was always getting frightened lest
she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them
alone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew spoke he
could tell a story very well natasha listened to him with pride when
she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and
scrutinizingly at her she asked herself in perplexity what does he
look for in me he is trying to discover something by looking at me
what if what he seeks in me is not there sometimes she fell into one
of the mad merry moods characteristic of her and then she particularly
loved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed he seldom laughed but
when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and after
such a laugh she always felt nearer to him natasha would have been
completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and
drawing near had not terrified her just as the mere thought of it made
on the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with
him pierre who had not been to the rostovs once since the ball pierre
seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the countess and
natasha sat down beside a little chess table with sonya thereby
inviting prince andrew to come too he did so
you have known bezukhov a long time he asked do you like him
and as usual when speaking of pierre she began to tell anecdotes of his
absent mindedness some of which had even been invented about him
do you know i have entrusted him with our secret i have known him from
childhood he has a heart of gold i beg you natalie prince andrew
said with sudden seriousness i am going away and heaven knows what may
happen you may cease to all right i know i am not to say that only
this then whatever may happen to you when i am not here
whatever trouble may come prince andrew continued i beg you
mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone for
advice and help he is a most absent minded and absurd fellow but he
neither her father nor her mother nor sonya nor prince andrew himself
could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on
natasha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day
dry eyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
what awaited her she did not even cry when on taking leave he kissed
her hand for the last time dont go she said in a tone that made him
wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long
afterwards nor did she cry when he was gone but for several days she
sat in her room dry eyed taking no interest in anything and only saying
now and then oh why did he go away
but a fortnight after his departure to the surprise of those around
her she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
her old self again but with a change in her moral physiognomy as a
child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face
during that year after his sons departure prince nicholas bolkonskis
health and temper became much worse he grew still more irritable and
it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits
of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so
as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible princess mary had two
passions and consequently two joys her nephew little nicholas and
religion and these were the favorite subjects of the princes attacks
and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children
you want to make him little nicholas into an old maid like
yourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid he
would say or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her in
princess marys presence how she liked our village priests and icons and
he continually hurt princess marys feelings and tormented her but it
cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or
could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust
and what is justice the princess never thought of that proud word
justice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and
simple law the law of love and self sacrifice taught us by him who
lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to
do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and
during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay
gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a
long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said
nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his
soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend
julie karagina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream
of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her
sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie
your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a
special providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your
excellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone can i
will not say comfort us but save us from despair religion alone can
explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what
cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life not merely
harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others are called away
to god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burden
to themselves and to others are left living the first death i saw and
one i shall never forget that of my dear sister in law left that
impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had
to die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged
anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to
die and what do you think dear friend five years have passed since
then and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearly
why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression of
the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though
generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite
love for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties as a
young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as
a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly prince
andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will
there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of
her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at
the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i should
then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and
certain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you of
the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a
single hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will is
governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for
you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my
wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will be
surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case is
this my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand
any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as
you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure the
notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the
great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but
from my fathers remarks and his talks with michael ivanovich i know all
that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on
buonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is not
accepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my father
cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his
political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow
for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of
expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might
derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it will
our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother andrews
absence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late after
his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has again
become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that
heart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me
that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he
has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more
nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you
write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active
cultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as a
relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody
here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on his
arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at the
way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as
that you write about i mean the report of my brothers betrothal to the
little rostova i do not think my brother will ever marry again and
certainly not her and this is why first i know that though he rarely
speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone too
deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our
little angel a stepmother secondly because as far as i know that girl
is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not think
he would choose her for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i am
running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet good bye my
dear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty care my dear
in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter
from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and
surprising news he informed her of his engagement to natasha rostova
the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
and confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
resolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of it
to his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her
father to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt
of his displeasure without attaining her object besides he wrote
the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now my father
then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months half of
that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever if the
doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia but
as it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know me and
my relations with father i want nothing from him i have been and
always shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse his
anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would
destroy half my happiness i am now writing to him about the same
question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and
to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is
hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months
after long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary gave the
letter to her father the next day the old prince said to her quietly
write and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it wont be
the princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speak
and raising his voice more and more cried
marry marry my boy a good family clever people eh rich eh
yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell him
that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little nicholas
stepmother and ill marry bourienne ha ha ha he mustnt be
without a stepmother either only one thing no more women are wanted in
my house let him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go and
live with him too he added turning to princess mary go in heavens
name go out into the frost the frost the frost
after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter
but repressed vexation at his sons poor spirited behavior found
expression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts for
irony a fresh one was now added allusions to stepmothers and
why shouldnt i marry her he asked his daughter shell make a
and latterly to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary noticed
that her father was really associating more and more with the
frenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his
letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
little nicholas and his education her brother andrew and religion were
princess marys joys and consolations but besides that since everyone
must have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of her
heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of
her life this comforting dream and hope were given her by gods folk
the half witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the princes
knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and observation she
had of life the greater was her wonder at the short sightedness of men
who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth toiling suffering
struggling and harming one another to obtain that impossible
visionary sinful happiness prince andrew had loved his wife she died
but that was not enough he wanted to bind his happiness to another
woman her father objected to this because he wanted a more
distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled and
suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their
eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an
instant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the son of god
came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is
a probation yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it how
is it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no one except
these despised gods folk who wallet on back come to me by the back
door afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of ill usage by
him but for fear of causing him to sin to leave family home and all
the cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything to
wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doing
no one any harm but praying for all for those who drive one away as
well as for those who protect one higher than that life and truth there
there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
theodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her once when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking of
her life the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary
thought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind that
strange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosed
this thought to no one but to her confessor father akinfi the monk
and he approved of her intention under guise of a present for the
pilgrims princess mary prepared a pilgrims complete costume for
herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief
often approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure
princess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come to
often listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by their
simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning
that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and
running away from home in imagination she already pictured herself by
theodosias side dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet
on her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from one
saints shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire and
reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but
i shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get
used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on till
my legs fail and ill lie down and die somewhere and shall at last
reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor
but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko
nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she
was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god
the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a
condition of the first mans blessedness before the fall fallen man has
retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only
because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because
our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease an
inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man could
find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his
duty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitive
blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
is the lot of a whole class the military the chief attraction of
military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
nicholas rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full when
after 1807 he continued to serve in the pavlograd regiment in which he
already commanded the squadron he had taken over from denisov
rostov had become a bluff good natured fellow whom his moscow
acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked
and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well
contented with his life of late in 1809 he found in letters from home
more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come
back to gladden and comfort his old parents
reading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take
him away from surroundings in which protected from all the
entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt that
sooner or later he would have to re enter that whirlpool of life with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with
stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with sonyas
love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult and
complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in
french beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient son
which said nothing of when he would return in 1810 he received letters
from his parents in which they told him of natashas engagement to
bolkonski and that the wedding would be in a years time because the
old prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortified
nicholas in the first place he was sorry that natasha for whom he
cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to the
home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not to
have been there to show that fellow bolkonski that connection with him
was no such great honor after all and that if he loved natasha he might
dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he
hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natasha
before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations
about sonya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas again
put it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter from
his mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letter
persuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and take
matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and they
would all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted mitenka
so much and was so good natured that everybody took advantage of him
and things were going from bad to worse for gods sake i implore you
come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family
this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a matter of
fact man which showed him what he ought to do
the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate
to go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after his
after dinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious
gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when he
returned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavrushka
denisovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades who
turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
go away without having heard from the staff and this interested him
extremely whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think
that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish
count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostov had betted
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed
that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish
mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given
one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place
without him he knew he must go away from this good bright world to
somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later he
obtained his leave his hussar comrades not only those of his own
regiment but the whole brigade gave rostov a dinner to which the
subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two
bands and two choirs of singers rostov danced the trepak with major
basov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rostov the
soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah and
then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
during the first half of the journey from kremenchug to kiev all
rostovs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with the
squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his
three roans and dozhoyveyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiously
how things would be at otradnoe and what he would find there thoughts
of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it far stronger as
though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of
attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance at
the last post station before otradnoe he gave the driver a three ruble
tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps of
after the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
expectation the feeling that everything is just the same so why did i
hurry nicholas began to settle down in his old home world his father
and mother were much the same only a little older what was new in them
was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not to
be and which as nicholas soon found out was due to the bad state of
their affairs sonya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettier
and promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough she
exhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas returned and the
faithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him
petya and natasha surprised nicholas most petya was a big handsome boy
of thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that was
already breaking as for natasha for a long while nicholas wondered and
youre not the same at all he said
on the contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to her
she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to
well are you glad natasha asked i am so tranquil and happy now
very glad answered nicholas he is an excellent fellow and are
how shall i put it replied natasha i was in love with boris with
my teacher and with denisov but this is quite different i feel at
peace and settled i know that no better man than he exists and i am
calm and contented now not at all as before
nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
for a year but natasha attacked her brother with exasperation proving
to him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing
to enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wished
her brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem at all
like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband she was even
tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this amazed nicholas
and even made him regard bolkonskis courtship skeptically he could not
believe that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her with
prince andrew it always seemed to him that there was something not
why this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had
touched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surprise
and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she too
you see he writes said she showing her son a letter of prince
andrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
daughters future married happiness he writes that he wont come
before december what can be keeping him illness probably his health
is very delicate dont tell natasha and dont attach importance to her
being so bright thats because shes living through the last days of
her girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive a letter
from him however god grant that everything turns out well she
always ended with these words he is an excellent man
after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull he was
worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
matters for which his mother had called him home to throw off this
burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he
went angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
was going to mitenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything but
what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less than the
frightened and bewildered mitenka the conversation and the examination
of the accounts with mitenka did not last long the village elder a
peasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in the
passage heard with fear and delight first the young counts voice
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of
abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other
robber ungrateful wretch ill hack the dog to pieces im not
then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in
the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mitenka out by the scruff of
the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let me
mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery this shrubbery was a well known haven of refuge for culprits
at otradnoe mitenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to
hide there and many of the residents at otradnoe hiding from mitenka
mitenkas wife and sisters in law thrust their heads and frightened
faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
where the stewards high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt
the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by
with resolute strides and went into the house
the countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on
tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another
next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed
but you know my dear boy its a pity you got excited mitenka has
i knew thought nicholas that i should never understand anything in
you were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles but they were
carried forward and you did not look at the other page
papa he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have
done i have done but if you like i wont speak to him again
no my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed he knew he had
mismanaged his wifes property and was to blame toward his children but
he did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to attend to the
no papa forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness i understand
devil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forward
from page to page he thought i used to understand what a corner
and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to another page i
dont understand at all said he to himself and after that he did not
meddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son and
informed him that she had a promissory note from anna mikhaylovna for
two thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with it
this answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i dont like
anna mikhaylovna and i dont like boris but they were our friends and
poor well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing caused
the old countess to weep tears of joy after that young rostov took no
further part in any business affairs but devoted himself with
passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit the chase for
the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an
earth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and its
bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
trodden down by the cattle and against the pale yellow stubble of the
spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of
august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had
become golden and bright red islands amid the green winter rye the
hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were
beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it was
the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent young
sportsman rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a
three days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on a
distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an
all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was
sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw
on the fifteenth when young rostov in his dressing gown looked out of
the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was
as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind
the only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic
particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung with
transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in
the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist
nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell of
decaying leaves and of dog milka a black spotted broad haunched bitch
with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched her
hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked
him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catching
sight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushing
headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself
o hoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call which
unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner
came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old
man with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a long
bent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn of
everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his circassian cap
to his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn was not offensive
to his master nicholas knew that this daniel disdainful of everybody
and who considered himself above them was all the same his serf and
daniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weather
the hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that
irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous
resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress
what orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deep
as a proto deacons and hoarse with hallooing and two flashing black
eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent can you
resist it those eyes seemed to be asking
its a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked nicholas
i sent uvarka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a minutes
pause he says shes moved them into the otradnoe enclosure they were
howling there this meant that the she wolf about whom they both
knew had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse a small place a
we ought to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me with
five minutes later daniel and uvarka were standing in nicholas big
study though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was like
seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
surroundings of human life daniel himself felt this and as usual stood
just inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear of
breaking something in the masters apartment and he hastened to say all
that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into the
having finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion that
the hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholas
ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to go
natasha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or
finished dressing and with her old nurses big shawl wrapped round her
you are going asked natasha i knew you would sonya said you
wouldnt go but i knew that today is the sort of day when you couldnt
yes we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as he
intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take natasha and petya
we are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you
you know it is my greatest pleasure said natasha its not fair you
are going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said nothing to
no barrier bars a russians path well go shouted petya
but you cant mamma said you mustnt said nicholas to natasha
yes ill go i shall certainly go said natasha decisively daniel
tell them to saddle for us and michael must come with my dogs she
it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but to
have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible he cast
down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business
careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
the old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
but had now handed it all completely over to his sons care being in
very good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go out
in an hours time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholas
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles went past natasha and petya who were trying to
tell him something he had a look at all the details of the hunt sent a
pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his
chestnut donets and whistling to his own leash of borzois set off
across the threshing ground to a field leading to the otradnoe wood the
old counts horse a sorrel gelding called viflyanka was led by the
groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in a
small trap straight to a spot reserved for him
they were taking fifty four hounds with six hunt attendants and
whippers in besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen and
more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash
belonging to members of the family there were about a hundred and
each dog knew its master and its call each man in the hunt knew his
business his place what he had to do as soon as they had passed the
fence they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk
along the road and field leading to the otradnoe covert
the horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet now and then
splashing into puddles as they crossed a road the misty sky still
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air was
still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a huntsman the
snort of a horse the crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling
when they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with dogs
appeared out of the mist approaching the rostovs in front rode a
fresh looking handsome old man with a large gray mustache
good morning uncle said nicholas when the old man drew near
thats it come on i was sure of it began uncle he was a
distant relative of the rostovs a man of small means and their
neighbor i knew you wouldnt be able to resist it and its a good
thing youre going thats it come on this was uncles favorite
expression take the covert at once for my girchik says the ilagins
are at korniki with their hounds thats it come on theyll take
thats where im going shall we join up our packs asked nicholas
the hounds were joined into one pack and uncle and nicholas rode on
side by side natasha muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager
face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed by petya
who always kept close to her by michael a huntsman and by a groom
appointed to look after her petya who was laughing whipped and pulled
at his horse natasha sat easily and confidently on her black arabchik
and reined him in without effort with a firm hand
uncle looked round disapprovingly at petya and natasha he did not
like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting
good morning uncle we are going too shouted petya
good morning good morning but dont go overriding the hounds said
nicholas what a fine dog trunila is he knew me said natasha
in the first place trunila is not a dog but a harrier thought
nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel the
distance that ought to separate them at that moment natasha understood
you mustnt think well be in anyones way uncle she said well go
a good thing too little countess said uncle only mind you dont
fall off your horse he added because thats it come on youve
the oasis of the otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off
the huntsmen were already nearing it rostov having finally settled
with uncle where they should set on the hounds and having shown
natasha where she was to stand a spot where nothing could possibly run
well nephew youre going for a big wolf said uncle mind and
thats as may happen answered rostov karay here he shouted
answering uncles remark by this call to his borzoi karay was a
shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having tackled a big wolf
the old count knowing his sons ardor in the hunt hurried so as not to
be late and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when count
ilya rostov cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up with
his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him
where a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and fastened
on his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek well fed
and comfortable horse viflyanka which was turning gray like himself
his horses and trap were sent home count ilya rostov though not at
heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to the
bushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins
settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready looked
beside him was simon chekmar his personal attendant an old horseman
now somewhat stiff in the saddle chekmar held in leash three formidable
wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and his horse
two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces farther along
the edge of the wood stood mitka the counts other groom a daring
horseman and keen rider to hounds before the hunt by old custom the
count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken a snack and
washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeaux
he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes were
rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle
wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an
the thin hollow cheeked chekmar having got everything ready kept
glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
thirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
chat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it was
plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count this
person was a gray bearded old man in a womans cloak with a tall peaked
cap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a womans name
well nastasya ivanovna whispered the count winking at him if you
scare away the beast danielll give it you
i know a thing or two myself said nastasya ivanovna
hush whispered the count and turned to simon have you seen the
with young count peter by the zharov rank grass answered simon
smiling though shes a lady shes very fond of hunting
and youre surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the count
of course its marvelous so bold so easy
and nicholas where is he by the lyadov upland isnt he
yes sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well
that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing
rides well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh
a perfect picture how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
zavarzinsk thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight
when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles
and the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far to
to search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had not
said more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his coat
the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michael
sidorych simon did not finish for on the still air he had
distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
giving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning
finger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs he
the count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into
the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding
the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the hounds
came the deep tones of the wolf call from daniels hunting horn the
pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry
with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a
wolf the whippers in no longer set on the hounds but changed to the
cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose daniels voice now a deep
bass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
carried far beyond out into the open field
after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the
sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in
the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and it
was with this that daniels voice was heard calling ulyulyu the sounds
of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more
simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand
opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that was
pushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped the
snuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up the count and
then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly
approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just
the count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyes
