waterloo one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we
are relating is connected with this battle but this history is not our
subject this history moreover has been finished and finished in a
masterly manner from one point of view by napoleon and from another
point of view by a whole pleiad of historians7
as for us we leave the historians at loggerheads we are but a distant
witness a passer by on the plain a seeker bending over that soil all
made of human flesh taking appearances for realities perchance we
have no right to oppose in the name of science a collection of facts
which contain illusions no doubt we possess neither military practice
nor strategic ability which authorize a system in our opinion a chain
of accidents dominated the two leaders at waterloo and when it becomes
a question of destiny that mysterious culprit we judge like that
those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of waterloo
have only to place mentally on the ground a capital a the left limb
of the a is the road to nivelles the right limb is the road to genappe
the tie of the a is the hollow road to ohain from braine lalleud the
top of the a is mont saint jean where wellington is the lower left tip
is hougomont where reille is stationed with jerome bonaparte the right
tip is the belle alliance where napoleon was at the centre of this
chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was
pronounced it was there that the lion has been placed the involuntary
symbol of the supreme heroism of the imperial guard
the triangle included in the top of the a between the two limbs and the
tie is the plateau of mont saint jean the dispute over this plateau
constituted the whole battle the wings of the two armies extended to
the right and left of the two roads to genappe and nivelles derlon
behind the tip of the a behind the plateau of mont saint jean is the
as for the plain itself let the reader picture to himself a vast
undulating sweep of ground each rise commands the next rise and all
the undulations mount towards mont saint jean and there end in the
two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers it is a
question of seizing the opponent round the waist the one seeks to trip
up the other they clutch at everything a bush is a point of support
an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder for the lack
of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up a regiment yields its
ground an unevenness in the ground a chance turn in the landscape a
cross path encountered at the right moment a grove a ravine can
stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army and prevent its
retreat he who quits the field is beaten hence the necessity devolving
on the responsible leader of examining the most insignificant clump of
trees and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground
the two generals had attentively studied the plain of mont saint jean
now called the plain of waterloo in the preceding year wellington
with the sagacity of foresight had examined it as the possible seat of
a great battle upon this spot and for this duel on the 18th of june
wellington had the good post napoleon the bad post the english army
it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on
horseback glass in hand upon the heights of rossomme at daybreak on
june 18 1815 all the world has seen him before we can show him
that calm profile under the little three cornered hat of the school of
brienne that green uniform the white revers concealing the star of the
legion of honor his great coat hiding his epaulets the corner of red
ribbon peeping from beneath his vest his leather trousers the white
horse with the saddle cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners
crowned ns and eagles hessian boots over silk stockings silver spurs
the sword of marengo that whole figure of the last of the caesars is
present to all imaginations saluted with acclamations by some severely
that figure stood for a long time wholly in the light this arose from
a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes and which
always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time but to day history
that light called history is pitiless it possesses this peculiar and
divine quality that pure light as it is and precisely because it
is wholly light it often casts a shadow in places where people had
hitherto beheld rays from the same man it constructs two different
phantoms and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it and
the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader
hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations
babylon violated lessens alexander rome enchained lessens caesar
jerusalem murdered lessens titus tyranny follows the tyrant it is a
misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form
every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle a beginning
which was troubled uncertain hesitating menacing to both armies but
still more so for the english than for the french
it had rained all night the earth had been cut up by the downpour the
water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if
in casks at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried
up to the axles the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid
mud if the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports
on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the
wheels all movement particularly in the valleys in the direction of
the affair began late napoleon as we have already explained was in
the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand like a pistol
aiming it now at one point now at another of the battle and it had
been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop
freely in order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come
out and dry the soil but the sun did not make its appearance it was
no longer the rendezvous of austerlitz when the first cannon was fired
the english general colville looked at his watch and noted that it
the action was begun furiously with more fury perhaps than the
emperor would have wished by the left wing of the french resting on
hougomont at the same time napoleon attacked the centre by hurling
quiots brigade on la haie sainte and ney pushed forward the right
wing of the french against the left wing of the english which rested on
the attack on hougomont was something of a feint the plan was to draw
wellington thither and to make him swerve to the left this plan would
have succeeded if the four companies of the english guards and the brave
belgians of perponchers division had not held the position solidly and
wellington instead of massing his troops there could confine himself
to despatching thither as reinforcements only four more companies of
the attack of the right wing of the french on papelotte was calculated
in fact to overthrow the english left to cut off the road to brussels
to bar the passage against possible prussians to force mont saint jean
to turn wellington back on hougomont thence on braine lalleud thence
on hal nothing easier with the exception of a few incidents this
attack succeeded papelotte was taken la haie sainte was carried
a detail to be noted there was in the english infantry particularly
in kempts brigade a great many raw recruits these young soldiers were
valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry their inexperience
extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma they performed particularly
excellent service as skirmishers the soldier skirmisher left somewhat
to himself becomes so to speak his own general these recruits
displayed some of the french ingenuity and fury this novice of an
after the taking of la haie sainte the battle wavered
there is in this day an obscure interval from mid day to four oclock
the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct and participates
in the sombreness of the hand to hand conflict twilight reigns over it
we perceive vast fluctuations in that fog a dizzy mirage paraphernalia
of war almost unknown to day pendant colbacks floating sabre taches
cross belts cartridge boxes for grenades hussar dolmans red boots
with a thousand wrinkles heavy shakos garlanded with torsades the
almost black infantry of brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry
of england the english soldiers with great white circular pads on the
slopes of their shoulders for epaulets the hanoverian light horse with
their oblong casques of leather with brass hands and red horse tails
the scotch with their bare knees and plaids the great white gaiters
of our grenadiers pictures not strategic lines what salvator rosa
requires not what is suited to the needs of gribeauval
a certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle quid
obscurum quid divinum each historian traces to some extent the
particular feature which pleases him amid this pell mell whatever may
be the combinations of the generals the shock of armed masses has an
incalculable ebb during the action the plans of the two leaders enter
into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape such a point of
the field of battle devours more combatants than such another just as
more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which
is poured on them it becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than
one would like a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen the
line of battle waves and undulates like a thread the trails of blood
gush illogically the fronts of the armies waver the regiments
form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw all these reefs are
continually moving in front of each other where the infantry stood the
artillery arrives the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was the
battalions are like smoke there was something there seek it it has
disappeared the open spots change place the sombre folds advance and
retreat a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward hurls back
distends and disperses these tragic multitudes what is a fray an
oscillation the immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute
not a day in order to depict a battle there is required one of those
powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes rembrandt is better
than vandermeulen vandermeulen exact at noon lies at three oclock
geometry is deceptive the hurricane alone is trustworthy that is what
confers on folard the right to contradict polybius let us add that
there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat
becomes specialized and disperses into innumerable detailed feats
which to borrow the expression of napoleon himself belong rather to
the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army the
historian has in this case the evident right to sum up the whole he
cannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle and
it is not given to any one narrator however conscientious he may be
to fix absolutely the form of that horrible cloud which is called a
this which is true of all great armed encounters is particularly
nevertheless at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a
towards four oclock the condition of the english army was serious the
prince of orange was in command of the centre hill of the right wing
picton of the left wing the prince of orange desperate and intrepid
shouted to the hollando belgians nassau brunswick never retreat
hill having been weakened had come up to the support of wellington
picton was dead at the very moment when the english had captured from
the french the flag of the 105th of the line the french had killed the
english general picton with a bullet through the head the battle
had for wellington two bases of action hougomont and la haie sainte
hougomont still held out but was on fire la haie sainte was taken of
the german battalion which defended it only forty two men survived all
the officers except five were either dead or captured three thousand
combatants had been massacred in that barn a sergeant of the english
guards the foremost boxer in england reputed invulnerable by his
companions had been killed there by a little french drummer boy baring
had been dislodged alten put to the sword many flags had been lost
one from altens division and one from the battalion of lunenburg
carried by a prince of the house of deux ponts the scotch grays no
longer existed ponsonbys great dragoons had been hacked to pieces
that valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of bro and beneath
the cuirassiers of travers out of twelve hundred horses six
hundred remained out of three lieutenant colonels two lay on the
earth hamilton wounded mater slain ponsonby had fallen riddled by
seven lance thrusts gordon was dead marsh was dead two divisions the
hougomont injured la haie sainte taken there now existed but one
rallying point the centre that point still held firm wellington
reinforced it he summoned thither hill who was at merle braine he
the centre of the english army rather concave very dense and
very compact was strongly posted it occupied the plateau of
mont saint jean having behind it the village and in front of it the
slope which was tolerably steep then it rested on that stout stone
dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of nivelles and
which marks the intersection of the roads a pile of the sixteenth
century and so robust that the cannon balls rebounded from it without
injuring it all about the plateau the english had cut the hedges here
and there made embrasures in the hawthorn trees thrust the throat of
a cannon between two branches embattled the shrubs there artillery was
ambushed in the brushwood this punic labor incontestably authorized
by war which permits traps was so well done that haxo who had been
despatched by the emperor at nine oclock in the morning to reconnoitre
the enemys batteries had discovered nothing of it and had returned
and reported to napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two
barricades which barred the road to nivelles and to genappe it was
at the season when the grain is tall on the edge of the plateau a
battalion of kempts brigade the 95th armed with carabines was
thus assured and buttressed the centre of the anglo dutch army was well
posted the peril of this position lay in the forest of soignes
then adjoining the field of battle and intersected by the ponds of
groenendael and boitsfort an army could not retreat thither without
dissolving the regiments would have broken up immediately there
the artillery would have been lost among the morasses the retreat
according to many a man versed in the art though it is disputed by
to this centre wellington added one of chasses brigades taken from the
right wing and one of winckes brigades taken from the left wing plus
clintons division to his english to the regiments of halkett to
the brigades of mitchell to the guards of maitland he gave as
reinforcements and aids the infantry of brunswick nassaus contingent
kielmanseggs hanoverians and omptedas germans this placed twenty six
battalions under his hand the right wing as charras says was thrown
back on the centre an enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at
the spot where there now stands what is called the museum of waterloo
besides this wellington had behind a rise in the ground somersets
dragoon guards fourteen hundred horse strong it was the remaining half
of the justly celebrated english cavalry ponsonby destroyed somerset
the battery which if completed would have been almost a redoubt was
ranged behind a very low garden wall backed up with a coating of bags
of sand and a large slope of earth this work was not finished there
had been no time to make a palisade for it
wellington uneasy but impassive was on horseback and there remained
the whole day in the same attitude a little in advance of the old mill
of mont saint jean which is still in existence beneath an elm which
an englishman an enthusiastic vandal purchased later on for two
hundred francs cut down and carried off wellington was coldly heroic
the bullets rained about him his aide de camp gordon fell at his
side lord hill pointing to a shell which had burst said to him my
lord what are your orders in case you are killed to do like me
replied wellington to clinton he said laconically to hold this spot
to the last man the day was evidently turning out ill wellington
shouted to his old companions of talavera of vittoria of salamanca
boys can retreat be thought of think of old england
towards four oclock the english line drew back suddenly nothing
was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the
sharpshooters the rest had disappeared the regiments dislodged by
the shells and the french bullets retreated into the bottom now
intersected by the back road of the farm of mont saint jean a
retrograde movement took place the english front hid itself wellington
drew back the beginning of retreat cried napoleon
the emperor though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble
had never been in a better humor than on that day his impenetrability
had been smiling ever since the morning on the 18th of june that
profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly the man who had been
gloomy at austerlitz was gay at waterloo the greatest favorites of
destiny make mistakes our joys are composed of shadow the supreme
ridet caesar pompeius flebit said the legionaries of the fulminatrix
legion pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion but it is
certain that caesar laughed while exploring on horseback at one oclock
on the preceding night in storm and rain in company with bertrand the
communes in the neighborhood of rossomme satisfied at the sight of the
long line of the english camp fires illuminating the whole horizon from
frischemont to braine lalleud it had seemed to him that fate to
whom he had assigned a day on the field of waterloo was exact to
the appointment he stopped his horse and remained for some time
motionless gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder
and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious
saying we are in accord napoleon was mistaken they were no longer
he took not a moment for sleep every instant of that night was marked
by a joy for him he traversed the line of the principal outposts
halting here and there to talk to the sentinels at half past two near
the wood of hougomont he heard the tread of a column on the march he
thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of wellington
he said it is the rear guard of the english getting under way for the
purpose of decamping i will take prisoners the six thousand english who
have just arrived at ostend he conversed expansively he regained the
animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of march when
he pointed out to the grand marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the gulf
juan and cried well bertrand here is a reinforcement already on
the night of the 17th to the 18th of june he rallied wellington that
little englishman needs a lesson said napoleon the rain redoubled in
violence the thunder rolled while the emperor was speaking
at half past three oclock in the morning he lost one illusion
officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that
the enemy was not making any movement nothing was stirring not a
bivouac fire had been extinguished the english army was asleep the
silence on earth was profound the only noise was in the heavens
at four oclock a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts this
peasant had served as guide to a brigade of english cavalry probably
vivians brigade which was on its way to take up a position in the
village of ohain at the extreme left at five oclock two belgian
deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment
and that the english army was ready for battle so much the better
exclaimed napoleon i prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive
in the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an
angle with the plancenoit road had a kitchen table and a peasants
chair brought to him from the farm of rossomme seated himself with a
truss of straw for a carpet and spread out on the table the chart
of the battle field saying to soult as he did so a pretty
in consequence of the rains during the night the transports of
provisions embedded in the soft roads had not been able to arrive by
morning the soldiers had had no sleep they were wet and fasting this
did not prevent napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to ney we have
ninety chances out of a hundred at eight oclock the emperors
breakfast was brought to him he invited many generals to it during
breakfast it was said that wellington had been to a ball two nights
before in brussels at the duchess of richmonds and soult a rough
man of war with a face of an archbishop said the ball takes place
to day the emperor jested with ney who said wellington will not be
so simple as to wait for your majesty that was his way however he
was fond of jesting says fleury de chaboulon a merry humor was
at the foundation of his character says gourgaud he abounded in
pleasantries which were more peculiar than witty says benjamin
constant these gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence it was
he who called his grenadiers his grumblers he pinched their ears he
pulled their mustaches the emperor did nothing but play pranks on us
is the remark of one of them during the mysterious trip from the island
of elba to france on the 27th of february on the open sea the french
brig of war le zephyr having encountered the brig linconstant on
which napoleon was concealed and having asked the news of napoleon
from linconstant the emperor who still wore in his hat the white and
amaranthine cockade sown with bees which he had adopted at the isle of
elba laughingly seized the speaking trumpet and answered for himself
the emperor is well a man who laughs like that is on familiar terms
with events napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the
breakfast at waterloo after breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an
hour then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw pen in
hand and their paper on their knees and the emperor dictated to them
at nine oclock at the instant when the french army ranged in echelons
and set in motion in five columns had deployed the divisions in two
lines the artillery between the brigades the music at their head as
they beat the march with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets
mighty vast joyous a sea of casques of sabres and of bayonets on
the horizon the emperor was touched and twice exclaimed magnificent
between nine oclock and half past ten the whole army incredible as it
may appear had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines
forming to repeat the emperors expression the figure of six vs
a few moments after the formation of the battle array in the midst of
that profound silence like that which heralds the beginning of a storm
which precedes engagements the emperor tapped haxo on the shoulder as
he beheld the three batteries of twelve pounders detached by his orders
from the corps of erlon reille and lobau and destined to begin the
action by taking mont saint jean which was situated at the intersection
of the nivelles and the genappe roads and said to him there are four
sure of the issue he encouraged with a smile as they passed before
him the company of sappers of the first corps which he had appointed
to barricade mont saint jean as soon as the village should be carried
all this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty
pity perceiving on his left at a spot where there now stands a large
tomb those admirable scotch grays with their superb horses massing
then he mounted his horse advanced beyond rossomme and selected for
his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of
the road from genappe to brussels which was his second station during
the battle the third station the one adopted at seven oclock in the
evening between la belle alliance and la haie sainte is formidable
it is a rather elevated knoll which still exists and behind which the
guard was massed on a slope of the plain around this knoll the balls
rebounded from the pavements of the road up to napoleon himself as at
brienne he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the
heavy artillery mouldy cannon balls old sword blades and shapeless
projectiles eaten up with rust were picked up at the spot where his
horse feet stood scabra rubigine a few years ago a shell of sixty
pounds still charged and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb
was unearthed it was at this last post that the emperor said to his
guide lacoste a hostile and terrified peasant who was attached to the
saddle of a hussar and who turned round at every discharge of canister
and tried to hide behind napoleon fool it is shameful youll get
yourself killed with a ball in the back he who writes these lines has
himself found in the friable soil of this knoll on turning over
the sand the remains of the neck of a bomb disintegrated by the
oxidization of six and forty years and old fragments of iron which
every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the
plains where the engagement between napoleon and wellington took place
are no longer what they were on june 18 1815 by taking from this
mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it its real relief
has been taken away and history disconcerted no longer finds her
bearings there it has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying
it wellington when he beheld waterloo once more two years later
exclaimed they have altered my field of battle where the great
pyramid of earth surmounted by the lion rises to day there was a
hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the nivelles road but
which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to genappe
the elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of
the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from
genappe to brussels one the english tomb is on the left the other
the german tomb is on the right there is no french tomb the whole
of that plain is a sepulchre for france thanks to the thousands upon
thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and
fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference the plateau
of mont saint jean is now accessible by an easy slope on the day of
battle particularly on the side of la haie sainte it was abrupt and
difficult of approach the slope there is so steep that the english
cannon could not see the farm situated in the bottom of the valley
which was the centre of the combat on the 18th of june 1815 the rains
had still farther increased this acclivity the mud complicated the
problem of the ascent and the men not only slipped back but stuck fast
in the mire along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose
presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine
what was this trench let us explain braine lalleud is a belgian
village ohain is another these villages both of them concealed in
curves of the landscape are connected by a road about a league and a
half in length which traverses the plain along its undulating level
and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow which
makes a ravine of this road in some places in 1815 as at the present
day this road cut the crest of the plateau of mont saint jean between
the two highways from genappe and nivelles only it is now on a level
with the plain it was then a hollow way its two slopes have been
appropriated for the monumental hillock this road was and still is
a trench throughout the greater portion of its course a hollow trench
sometimes a dozen feet in depth and whose banks being too steep
crumbled away here and there particularly in winter under driving
rains accidents happened here the road was so narrow at the
braine lalleud entrance that a passer by was crushed by a cart as is
proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery and which gives
the name of the dead monsieur bernard debrye merchant of brussels
and the date of the accident february 16378 it was so deep on
the table land of mont saint jean that a peasant mathieu nicaise
was crushed there in 1783 by a slide from the slope as is stated on
another stone cross the top of which has disappeared in the process of
clearing the ground but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on
the grassy slope to the left of the highway between la haie sainte and
on the day of battle this hollow road whose existence was in no way
indicated bordering the crest of mont saint jean a trench at the
summit of the escarpment a rut concealed in the soil was invisible
chapter viii the emperor puts a question to the guide lacoste
so on the morning of waterloo napoleon was content
he was right the plan of battle conceived by him was as we have seen
the battle once begun its very various changes the resistance of
hougomont the tenacity of la haie sainte the killing of bauduin the
disabling of foy the unexpected wall against which soyes brigade was
shattered guilleminots fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard
nor powder sacks the miring of the batteries the fifteen unescorted
pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by uxbridge the small effect of the
bombs falling in the english lines and there embedding themselves in
the rain soaked soil and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud
so that the canister was turned into a splash the uselessness of pires
demonstration on braine lalleud all that cavalry fifteen squadrons
almost exterminated the right wing of the english badly alarmed the
left wing badly cut into neys strange mistake in massing instead of
echelonning the four divisions of the first corps men delivered over to
grape shot arranged in ranks twenty seven deep and with a frontage
of two hundred the frightful holes made in these masses by the
cannon balls attacking columns disorganized the side battery suddenly
unmasked on their flank bourgeois donzelot and durutte compromised
quiot repulsed lieutenant vieux that hercules graduated at the
polytechnic school wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an
axe the door of la haie sainte under the downright fire of the english
barricade which barred the angle of the road from genappe to brussels
marcognets division caught between the infantry and the cavalry shot
down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by best and pack put
to the sword by ponsonby his battery of seven pieces spiked the prince
of saxe weimar holding and guarding in spite of the comte derlon both
frischemont and smohain the flag of the 105th taken the flag of the
45th captured that black prussian hussar stopped by runners of the
flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between wavre
and plancenoit the alarming things that had been said by prisoners
grouchys delay fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of hougomont
in less than an hour eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter
time about la haie sainte all these stormy incidents passing like the
clouds of battle before napoleon had hardly troubled his gaze and
had not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty napoleon was
accustomed to gaze steadily at war he never added up the heart rending
details cipher by cipher ciphers mattered little to him provided that
they furnished the total victory he was not alarmed if the beginnings
did go astray since he thought himself the master and the possessor
at the end he knew how to wait supposing himself to be out of the
question and he treated destiny as his equal he seemed to say to fate
composed half of light and half of shadow napoleon thought himself
protected in good and tolerated in evil he had or thought that he had
a connivance one might almost say a complicity of events in his favor
which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity
nevertheless when one has beresina leipzig and fontainebleau behind
one it seems as though one might distrust waterloo a mysterious frown
becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens
at the moment when wellington retreated napoleon shuddered he suddenly
beheld the table land of mont saint jean cleared and the van of the
english army disappear it was rallying but hiding itself the emperor
half rose in his stirrups the lightning of victory flashed from his
wellington driven into a corner at the forest of soignes and
destroyed that was the definitive conquest of england by france it was
crecy poitiers malplaquet and ramillies avenged the man of marengo
so the emperor meditating on this terrible turn of fortune swept his
glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle his
guard standing behind him with grounded arms watched him from below
with a sort of religion he pondered he examined the slopes noted the
declivities scrutinized the clumps of trees the square of rye the
path he seemed to be counting each bush he gazed with some intentness
at the english barricades of the two highways two large abatis of
trees that on the road to genappe above la haie sainte armed with two
cannon the only ones out of all the english artillery which commanded
the extremity of the field of battle and that on the road to nivelles
where gleamed the dutch bayonets of chasses brigade near this
barricade he observed the old chapel of saint nicholas painted white
which stands at the angle of the cross road near braine lalleud he
bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide lacoste the guide made
a negative sign with his head which was probably perfidious
the emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking
all that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him
napoleon turning round abruptly despatched an express at full speed to
paris to announce that the battle was won
napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts
he had just found his clap of thunder
he gave orders to milhauds cuirassiers to carry the table land of
there were three thousand five hundred of them they formed a front a
quarter of a league in extent they were giant men on colossal horses
there were six and twenty squadrons of them and they had behind them to
support them lefebvre desnouettess division the one hundred and six
picked gendarmes the light cavalry of the guard eleven hundred and
ninety seven men and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and
eighty lances they wore casques without horse tails and cuirasses
of beaten iron with horse pistols in their holsters and long
sabre swords that morning the whole army had admired them when at
nine oclock with braying of trumpets and all the music playing let us
watch oer the safety of the empire they had come in a solid column
with one of their batteries on their flank another in their centre and
deployed in two ranks between the roads to genappe and frischemont
and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line
so cleverly arranged by napoleon which having on its extreme left
kellermanns cuirassiers and on its extreme right milhauds cuirassiers
had so to speak two wings of iron
aide de camp bernard carried them the emperors orders ney drew his
sword and placed himself at their head the enormous squadrons were set
all their cavalry with upraised swords standards and trumpets flung to
the breeze formed in columns by divisions descended by a simultaneous
movement and like one man with the precision of a brazen battering ram
which is effecting a breach the hill of la belle alliance plunged into
the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen disappeared
there in the smoke then emerging from that shadow reappeared on the
other side of the valley still compact and in close ranks mounting at
a full trot through a storm of grape shot which burst upon them
the terrible muddy slope of the table land of mont saint jean they
ascended grave threatening imperturbable in the intervals between
the musketry and the artillery their colossal trampling was audible
being two divisions there were two columns of them wathiers division
held the right delorts division was on the left it seemed as though
two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest
of the table land it traversed the battle like a prodigy
nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of
the muskowa by the heavy cavalry murat was lacking here but ney was
again present it seemed as though that mass had become a monster and
had but one soul each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a
polyp they could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent
here and there a confusion of helmets of cries of sabres a stormy
heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of
trumpets a terrible and disciplined tumult over all the cuirasses
these narrations seemed to belong to another age something parallel to
this vision appeared no doubt in the ancient orphic epics which told
of the centaurs the old hippanthropes those titans with human
heads and equestrian chests who scaled olympus at a gallop horrible
odd numerical coincidence twenty six battalions rode to meet
twenty six battalions behind the crest of the plateau in the shadow of
the masked battery the english infantry formed into thirteen squares
two battalions to the square in two lines with seven in the first
line six in the second the stocks of their guns to their shoulders
taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing waited calm
mute motionless they did not see the cuirassiers and the cuirassiers
did not see them they listened to the rise of this flood of men they
heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse the alternate and
symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot the jingling of the
cuirasses the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage
breathing there ensued a most terrible silence then all at once
a long file of uplifted arms brandishing sabres appeared above the
crest and casques trumpets and standards and three thousand heads
with gray mustaches shouting vive lempereur all this cavalry
debouched on the plateau and it was like the appearance of an
all at once a tragic incident on the english left on our right the
head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor on
arriving at the culminating point of the crest ungovernable utterly
given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and
cannon the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench a trench
between them and the english it was the hollow road of ohain
it was a terrible moment the ravine was there unexpected yawning
directly under the horses feet two fathoms deep between its double
slopes the second file pushed the first into it and the third pushed
on the second the horses reared and fell backward landed on their
haunches slid down all four feet in the air crushing and overwhelming
the riders and there being no means of retreat the whole column being
no longer anything more than a projectile the force which had been
acquired to crush the english crushed the french the inexorable ravine
could only yield when filled horses and riders rolled there pell mell
grinding each other forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf when
this trench was full of living men the rest marched over them and
passed on almost a third of duboiss brigade fell into that abyss
a local tradition which evidently exaggerates matters says that two
thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road
of ohain this figure probably comprises all the other corpses which
were flung into this ravine the day after the combat
let us note in passing that it was duboiss sorely tried brigade which
an hour previously making a charge to one side had captured the flag
napoleon before giving the order for this charge of milhauds
cuirassiers had scrutinized the ground but had not been able to see
that hollow road which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of
the plateau warned nevertheless and put on the alert by the little
white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the nivelles
highway he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an
obstacle to the guide lacoste the guide had answered no we might
almost affirm that napoleons catastrophe originated in that sign of a
was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle we answer no
why because of wellington because of blucher no because of god
bonaparte victor at waterloo that does not come within the law of the
nineteenth century another series of facts was in preparation in which
there was no longer any room for napoleon the ill will of events had
it was time that this vast man should fall
the excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance
this individual alone counted for more than a universal group these
plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head the world
mounting to the brain of one man this would be mortal to civilization
were it to last the moment had arrived for the incorruptible and
supreme equity to alter its plan probably the principles and the
elements on which the regular gravitations of the moral as of the
material world depend had complained smoking blood over filled
cemeteries mothers in tears these are formidable pleaders when
the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden there are mysterious
groanings of the shades to which the abyss lends an ear
napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been
waterloo is not a battle it is a change of front on the part of the
chapter x the plateau of mont saint jean
the battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine
sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point blank on
the cuirassiers the intrepid general delort made the military salute to
the whole of the flying artillery of the english had re entered the
squares at a gallop the cuirassiers had not had even the time for a
halt the disaster of the hollow road had decimated but not discouraged
them they belonged to that class of men who when diminished in number
wathiers column alone had suffered in the disaster delorts column
which ney had deflected to the left as though he had a presentiment of
the cuirassiers hurled themselves on the english squares
at full speed with bridles loose swords in their teeth pistols in
there are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until
the soldier is changed into a statue and when all this flesh turns into
granite the english battalions desperately assaulted did not stir
all the faces of the english squares were attacked at once a frenzied
whirl enveloped them that cold infantry remained impassive the first
rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets the second
ranks shot them down behind the second rank the cannoneers charged
their guns the front of the square parted permitted the passage of
an eruption of grape shot and closed again the cuirassiers replied
by crushing them their great horses reared strode across the ranks
leaped over the bayonets and fell gigantic in the midst of these four
living wells the cannon balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers
the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares files of men disappeared
ground to dust under the horses the bayonets plunged into the bellies
of these centaurs hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably
never been seen anywhere else the squares wasted by this mad cavalry
closed up their ranks without flinching inexhaustible in the matter of
grape shot they created explosions in their assailants midst the form
of this combat was monstrous these squares were no longer battalions
they were craters those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry they were
a tempest each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud lava contended
the square on the extreme right the most exposed of all being in the
air was almost annihilated at the very first shock lt was formed
of the 75th regiment of highlanders the bagpipe player in the centre
dropped his melancholy eyes filled with the reflections of the
forests and the lakes in profound inattention while men were being
exterminated around him and seated on a drum with his pibroch under
his arm played the highland airs these scotchmen died thinking of ben
lothian as did the greeks recalling argos the sword of a cuirassier
which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it put an end to
the cuirassiers relatively few in number and still further diminished
by the catastrophe of the ravine had almost the whole english army
against them but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them
was equal to ten nevertheless some hanoverian battalions yielded
wellington perceived it and thought of his cavalry had napoleon at
that same moment thought of his infantry he would have won the battle
this forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake
all at once the cuirassiers who had been the assailants found
themselves assailed the english cavalry was at their back before
them two squares behind them somerset somerset meant fourteen hundred
dragoons of the guard on the right somerset had dornberg with the
german light horse and on his left trip with the belgian carabineers
the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front before and in the
rear by infantry and cavalry had to face all sides what mattered it
to them they were a whirlwind their valor was something indescribable
in addition to this they had behind them the battery which was still
thundering it was necessary that it should be so or they could never
have been wounded in the back one of their cuirasses pierced on the
shoulder by a ball from a biscayan9 is in the collection of the
for such frenchmen nothing less than such englishmen was needed it
was no longer a hand to hand conflict it was a shadow a fury a dizzy
transport of souls and courage a hurricane of lightning swords in an
instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred
fuller their lieutenant colonel fell dead ney rushed up with
the lancers and lefebvre desnouettess light horse the plateau
of mont saint jean was captured recaptured captured again the
cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry or to put
it more exactly the whole of that formidable rout collared each other
without releasing the other the squares still held firm
there were a dozen assaults ney had four horses killed under him half
the cuirassiers remained on the plateau this conflict lasted two hours
the english army was profoundly shaken there is no doubt that had they
not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow
road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the
victory this extraordinary cavalry petrified clinton who had seen
talavera and badajoz wellington three quarters vanquished admired
the cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen took or
spiked sixty pieces of ordnance and captured from the english regiments
six flags which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the guard bore
to the emperor in front of the farm of la belle alliance
wellingtons situation had grown worse this strange battle was like a
duel between two raging wounded men each of whom still fighting and
which of the two will be the first to fall
what had become of the cuirassiers no one could have told one thing
is certain that on the day after the battle a cuirassier and his
horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at
mont saint jean at the very point where the four roads from nivelles
genappe la hulpe and brussels meet and intersect each other this
horseman had pierced the english lines one of the men who picked up the
body still lives at mont saint jean his name is dehaze he was eighteen
wellington felt that he was yielding the crisis was at hand
the cuirassiers had not succeeded since the centre was not broken
through as every one was in possession of the plateau no one held it
and in fact it remained to a great extent with the english wellington
held the village and the culminating plain ney had only the crest and
the slope they seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides
but the weakening of the english seemed irremediable the bleeding
of that army was horrible kempt on the left wing demanded
reinforcements there are none replied wellington he must let
himself be killed almost at that same moment a singular coincidence
which paints the exhaustion of the two armies ney demanded infantry
from napoleon and napoleon exclaimed infantry where does he expect
me to get it does he think i can make it
nevertheless the english army was in the worse case of the two the
furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and
breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing a few men clustered
round a flag marked the post of a regiment such and such a battalion
was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant altens division
already so roughly handled at la haie sainte was almost destroyed
the intrepid belgians of van kluzes brigade strewed the rye fields
all along the nivelles road hardly anything was left of those dutch
grenadiers who intermingled with spaniards in our ranks in 1811
fought against wellington and who in 1815 rallied to the
english standard fought against napoleon the loss in officers was
considerable lord uxbridge who had his leg buried on the following
day had his knee shattered if on the french side in that tussle
of the cuirassiers delort lheritier colbert dnop travers and
blancard were disabled on the side of the english there was alten
wounded barne wounded delancey killed van meeren killed ompteda
killed the whole of wellingtons staff decimated and england had the
worse of it in that bloody scale the second regiment of foot guards
had lost five lieutenant colonels four captains and three ensigns
the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1200
soldiers the 79th highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded 18 officers
killed 450 soldiers killed the hanoverian hussars of cumberland a
whole regiment with colonel hacke at its head who was destined to be
tried later on and cashiered had turned bridle in the presence of the
fray and had fled to the forest of soignes sowing defeat all the way
to brussels the transports ammunition wagons the baggage wagons the
wagons filled with wounded on perceiving that the french were gaining
ground and approaching the forest rushed headlong thither the dutch
mowed down by the french cavalry cried alarm from vert coucou to
groentendael for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction
of brussels according to the testimony of eye witnesses who are still
alive the roads were encumbered with fugitives this panic was such
that it attacked the prince de conde at mechlin and louis xviii at
ghent with the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the
ambulance established at the farm of mont saint jean and of vivians
and vandeleurs brigades which flanked the left wing wellington had
no cavalry left a number of batteries lay unhorsed these facts are
attested by siborne and pringle exaggerating the disaster goes so far
as to say that the anglo dutch army was reduced to thirty four thousand
men the iron duke remained calm but his lips blanched vincent the
austrian commissioner alava the spanish commissioner who were present
at the battle in the english staff thought the duke lost at five
oclock wellington drew out his watch and he was heard to murmur these
it was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on
here comes the change of face in this giant drama
chapter xi a bad guide to napoleon a good guide to bulow
the painful surprise of napoleon is well known grouchy hoped for
fate has these turns the throne of the world was expected it was saint
if the little shepherd who served as guide to bulow bluchers
lieutenant had advised him to debouch from the forest above
frischemont instead of below plancenoit the form of the nineteenth
century might perhaps have been different napoleon would have won the
battle of waterloo by any other route than that below plancenoit
the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for
now the prussian general muffling declares that one hours delay and
blucher would not have found wellington on his feet the battle was
it was time that bulow should arrive as will be seen he had moreover
been very much delayed he had bivouacked at dion le mont and had set
out at daybreak but the roads were impassable and his divisions stuck
fast in the mire the ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons moreover
he had been obliged to pass the dyle on the narrow bridge of wavre
the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the french so
the caissons and ammunition wagons could not pass between two rows of
