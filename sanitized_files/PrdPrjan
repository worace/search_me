as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences she
frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to
their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the
extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and
in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for
elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was
occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she
dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each
other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of
talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open
pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him
language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time
all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation
and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her
resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait
on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing
her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them
