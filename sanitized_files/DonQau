numbers that they gave one another no breathing time
wherein is related the strange thing which may be regarded as an
of what happened don quixote on his way to barcelona

quixote in the whole course of this great history
which follows sixty nine and deals with matters indispensable for
of what passed between don quixote and his squire sancho on the
of how don quixote and sancho reached their village
of the omens don quixote had as he entered his own village and
other incidents that embellish and give a colour to this great history
of how don quixote fell sick and of the will he made and how he died
these days past when sending your excellency my plays that had appeared
in print before being shown on the stage i said if i remember well
that don quixote was putting on his spurs to go and render homage to your
excellency now i say that with his spurs he is on his way should he
reach destination methinks i shall have rendered some service to your
excellency as from many parts i am urged to send him off so as to
dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another don quixote who under
the name of second part has run masquerading through the whole world
and he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great
emperor of china who wrote me a letter in chinese a month ago and sent
it by a special courier he asked me or to be truthful he begged me to
send him don quixote for he intended to found a college where the
spanish tongue would be taught and it was his wish that the book to be
read should be the history of don quixote he also added that i should go
and be the rector of this college i asked the bearer if his majesty had
afforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses he answered no not even
then brother i replied you can return to your china post haste or
at whatever haste you are bound to go as i am not fit for so long a
travel and besides being ill i am very much without money while
emperor for emperor and monarch for monarch i have at naples the great
count of lemos who without so many petty titles of colleges and
rectorships sustains me protects me and does me more favour than i can
thus i gave him his leave and i beg mine from you offering your
excellency the trabajos de persiles y sigismunda a book i shall finish
within four months deo volente and which will be either the worst or
the best that has been composed in our language i mean of those intended
for entertainment at which i repent of having called it the worst for
in the opinion of friends it is bound to attain the summit of possible
quality may your excellency return in such health that is wished you
persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and i your feet being as i am
from madrid this last day of october of the year one thousand six
god bless me gentle or it may be plebeian reader how eagerly must
thou be looking forward to this preface expecting to find there
retaliation scolding and abuse against the author of the second don
quixote i mean him who was they say begotten at tordesillas and born
at tarragona well then the truth is i am not going to give thee that
satisfaction for though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts in
mine the rule must admit of an exception thou wouldst have me call him
ass fool and malapert but i have no such intention let his offence be
his punishment with his bread let him eat it and theres an end of it
what i cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and
one handed as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over
me or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern
and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen or the
future can hope to see if my wounds have no beauty to the beholders
eye they are at least honourable in the estimation of those who know
where they were received for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead
in battle than alive in flight and so strongly is this my feeling that
if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me i would
rather have had my share in that mighty action than be free from my
wounds this minute without having been present at it those the soldier
shows on his face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven
of honour and ambition of merited praise and moreover it is to be
observed that it is not with grey hairs that one writes but with the
understanding and that commonly improves with years i take it amiss
too that he calls me envious and explains to me as if i were ignorant
what envy is for really and truly of the two kinds there are i only
know that which is holy noble and high minded and if that be so as it
is i am not likely to attack a priest above all if in addition he
holds the rank of familiar of the holy office and if he said what he did
on account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke he is entirely
mistaken for i worship the genius of that person and admire his works
and his unceasing and strenuous industry after all i am grateful to
this gentleman the author for saying that my novels are more satirical
than exemplary but that they are good for they could not be that unless
there was a little of everything in them
i suspect thou wilt say that i am taking a very humble line and keeping
myself too much within the bounds of my moderation from a feeling that
additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer and that
what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great as he
does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight but
hides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some
lese majesty if perchance thou shouldst come to know him tell him from
me that i do not hold myself aggrieved for i know well what the
temptations of the devil are and that one of the greatest is putting it
into a mans head that he can write and print a book by which he will get
as much fame as money and as much money as fame and to prove it i will
beg of you in your own sprightly pleasant way to tell him this story
there was a madman in seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities
and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to it was this he
made a tube of reed sharp at one end and catching a dog in the street
or wherever it might be he with his foot held one of its legs fast and
with his hand lifted up the other and as best he could fixed the tube
where by blowing he made the dog as round as a ball then holding it in
this position he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly and let it go
saying to the bystanders and there were always plenty of them do your
worships think now that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog does
your worship think now that it is an easy thing to write a book
and if this story does not suit him you may dear reader tell him this
one which is likewise of a madman and a dog
in cordova there was another madman whose way it was to carry a piece of
marble slab or a stone not of the lightest on his head and when he
came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight
fall right on top of him on which the dog in a rage barking and
howling would run three streets without stopping it so happened
however that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a
cap makers dog of which his master was very fond the stone came down
hitting it on the head the dog raised a yell at the blow the master saw
the affair and was wroth and snatching up a measuring yard rushed out at
the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body and at every
stroke he gave him he said you dog you thief my lurcher dont you
see you brute that my dog is a lurcher and so repeating the word
lurcher again and again he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly the
madman took the lesson to heart and vanished and for more than a month
never once showed himself in public but after that he came out again
with his old trick and a heavier load than ever he came up to where
there was a dog and examining it very carefully without venturing to let
the stone fall he said this is a lurcher ware in short all the
dogs he came across be they mastiffs or terriers he said were lurchers
and he discharged no more stones maybe it will be the same with this
historian that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight
of his wit in books which being bad are harder than stones tell him
too that i do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of
depriving me of my profit by means of his book for to borrow from the
famous interlude of the perendenga i say in answer to him long life
to my lord the veintiquatro and christ be with us all long life to the
great conde de lemos whose christian charity and well known generosity
support me against all the strokes of my curst fortune and long life to
the supreme benevolence of his eminence of toledo don bernardo de
sandoval y rojas and what matter if there be no printing presses in the
world or if they print more books against me than there are letters in
the verses of mingo revulgo these two princes unsought by any adulation
or flattery of mine of their own goodness alone have taken it upon them
to show me kindness and protect me and in this i consider myself happier
and richer than if fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the
ordinary way the poor man may retain honour but not the vicious
poverty may cast a cloud over nobility but cannot hide it altogether
and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light even though it be through
the straits and chinks of penury it wins the esteem of lofty and noble
spirits and in consequence their protection thou needst say no more to
him nor will i say anything more to thee save to tell thee to bear in
mind that this second part of don quixote which i offer thee is cut by
the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the first and that in it i
present thee don quixote continued and at length dead and buried so
that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him
for that already produced is sufficient and suffice it too that some
reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd
lunacies of his without going into the matter again for abundance even
of good things prevents them from being valued and scarcity even in
the case of what is bad confers a certain value i was forgetting to
tell thee that thou mayest expect the persiles which i am now
finishing and also the second part of galatea
of the interview the curate and the barber had with don quixote about his
cide hamete benengeli in the second part of this history and third
sally of don quixote says that the curate and the barber remained nearly
a month without seeing him lest they should recall or bring back to his
recollection what had taken place they did not however omit to visit
his niece and housekeeper and charge them to be careful to treat him
with attention and give him comforting things to eat and such as were
good for the heart and the brain whence it was plain to see all his
misfortune proceeded the niece and housekeeper replied that they did so
and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity for they could
perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of
being in his right mind this gave great satisfaction to the curate and
the barber for they concluded they had taken the right course in
carrying him off enchanted on the ox cart as has been described in the
first part of this great as well as accurate history in the last chapter
thereof so they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in
his condition although they thought it almost impossible that there
could be any and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with
knight errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were
they came to see him consequently and found him sitting up in bed in a
green baize waistcoat and a red toledo cap and so withered and dried up
that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy they were very
cordially received by him they asked him after his health and he talked
to them about himself very naturally and in very well chosen language in
the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call
state craft and systems of government correcting this abuse and
condemning that reforming one practice and abolishing another each of
the three setting up for a new legislator a modern lycurgus or a
brand new solon and so completely did they remodel the state that they
seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite
different from what they had put in and on all the subjects they dealt
with don quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners
were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses
the niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not
find words enough to express their thanks to god at seeing their master
so clear in his mind the curate however changing his original plan
which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry resolved to test
don quixotes recovery thoroughly and see whether it were genuine or
not and so from one subject to another he came at last to talk of the
news that had come from the capital and among other things he said it
was considered certain that the turk was coming down with a powerful
fleet and that no one knew what his purpose was or when the great storm
would burst and that all christendom was in apprehension of this which
almost every year calls us to arms and that his majesty had made
provision for the security of the coasts of naples and sicily and the
to this don quixote replied his majesty has acted like a prudent
warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time so that the
enemy may not find him unprepared but if my advice were taken i would
recommend him to adopt a measure which at present no doubt his majesty
the moment the curate heard this he said to himself god keep thee in
his hand poor don quixote for it seems to me thou art precipitating
thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy
but the barber who had the same suspicion as the curate asked don
quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to
be adopted for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be
added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in
mine master shaver said don quixote will not be impertinent but
i dont mean that said the barber but that experience has shown that
all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his majesty are
either impossible or absurd or injurious to the king and to the
mine however replied don quixote is neither impossible nor absurd
but the easiest the most reasonable the readiest and most expeditious
that could suggest itself to any projectors mind
you take a long time to tell it senor don quixote said the curate
i dont choose to tell it here now said don quixote and have it
reach the ears of the lords of the council to morrow morning and some
other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble
for my part said the barber i give my word here and before god that
i will not repeat what your worship says to king rook or earthly
man an oath i learned from the ballad of the curate who in the
prelude told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred
i am not versed in stories said don quixote but i know the oath is a
good one because i know the barber to be an honest fellow
even if he were not said the curate i will go bail and answer for
him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy under pain of
and who will be security for you senor curate said don quixote
my profession replied the curate which is to keep secrets
ods body said don quixote at this what more has his majesty to do
but to command by public proclamation all the knights errant that are
scattered over spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital for even
if no more than half a dozen come there may be one among them who alone
will suffice to destroy the entire might of the turk give me your
attention and follow me is it pray any new thing for a single
knight errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men as if they
all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste nay tell me how
many histories are there filled with these marvels if only in an evil
hour for me i dont speak for anyone else the famous don belianis were
alive now or any one of the innumerable progeny of amadis of gaul if
any these were alive today and were to come face to face with the turk
by my faith i would not give much for the turks chance but god will
have regard for his people and will provide some one who if not so
valiant as the knights errant of yore at least will not be inferior to
them in spirit but god knows what i mean and i say no more
alas exclaimed the niece at this may i die if my master does not
want to turn knight errant again to which don quixote replied a
knight errant i shall die and let the turk come down or go up when he
likes and in as strong force as he can once more i say god knows what
i mean but here the barber said i ask your worships to give me leave
to tell a short story of something that happened in seville which comes
so pat to the purpose just now that i should like greatly to tell it
don quixote gave him leave and the rest prepared to listen and he began
in the madhouse at seville there was a man whom his relations had placed
there as being out of his mind he was a graduate of osuna in canon law
but even if he had been of salamanca it was the opinion of most people
that he would have been mad all the same this graduate after some years
of confinement took it into his head that he was sane and in his full
senses and under this impression wrote to the archbishop entreating him
earnestly and in very correct language to have him released from the
misery in which he was living for by gods mercy he had now recovered
his lost reason though his relations in order to enjoy his property
kept him there and in spite of the truth would make him out to be mad
until his dying day the archbishop moved by repeated sensible
well written letters directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of
the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiates statements and to have
an interview with the madman himself and if it should appear that he
was in his senses to take him out and restore him to liberty the
chaplain did so and the governor assured him that the man was still mad
and that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person he would
in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality
counterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before as might be
easily tested by talking to him the chaplain resolved to try the
experiment and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an
hour or more during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that
was incoherent or absurd but on the contrary spoke so rationally that
the chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane among other things
he said the governor was against him not to lose the presents his
relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals
and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property
for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the
mercy our lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a
man in short he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the
governor and made his relations appear covetous and heartless and
himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with
him that the archbishop might see him and ascertain for himself the
truth of the matter yielding to this conviction the worthy chaplain
begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had
entered the house given to him the governor again bade him beware of
what he was doing as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad but
all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain
from taking him away the governor seeing that it was the order of the
archbishop obeyed and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes
which were new and decent he as soon as he saw himself clothed like one
in his senses and divested of the appearance of a madman entreated the
chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades
the madmen the chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen
there were in the house so they went upstairs and with them some of
those who were present approaching a cage in which there was a furious
madman though just at that moment calm and quiet the licentiate said to
him brother think if you have any commands for me for i am going
home as god has been pleased in his infinite goodness and mercy
without any merit of mine to restore me my reason i am now cured and in
my senses for with gods power nothing is impossible have strong hope
and trust in him for as he has restored me to my original condition so
likewise he will restore you if you trust in him i will take care to
send you some good things to eat and be sure you eat them for i would
have you know i am convinced as one who has gone through it that all
this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains
full of wind take courage take courage for despondency in misfortune
to all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite
that of the furious one was listening and raising himself up from an old
mat on which he lay stark naked he asked in a loud voice who it was that
was going away cured and in his senses the licentiate answered it is
i brother who am going i have now no need to remain here any longer
for which i return infinite thanks to heaven that has had so great mercy
mind what you are saying licentiate dont let the devil deceive you
replied the madman keep quiet stay where you are and you will save
i know i am cured returned the licentiate and that i shall not have
you cured said the madman well we shall see god be with you but
i swear to you by jupiter whose majesty i represent on earth that for
this crime alone which seville is committing to day in releasing you
from this house and treating you as if you were in your senses i shall
have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages
and ages amen dost thou not know thou miserable little licentiate
that i can do it being as i say jupiter the thunderer who hold in my
hands the fiery bolts with which i am able and am wont to threaten and
lay waste the world but in one way only will i punish this ignorant
town and that is by not raining upon it nor on any part of its district
or territory for three whole years to be reckoned from the day and
moment when this threat is pronounced thou free thou cured thou in thy
senses and i mad i disordered i bound i will as soon think of sending
those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the
madman but our licentiate turning to the chaplain and seizing him by
the hands said to him be not uneasy senor attach no importance to
what this madman has said for if he is jupiter and will not send rain
i who am neptune the father and god of the waters will rain as often
as it pleases me and may be needful
the governor and the bystanders laughed and at their laughter the
chaplain was half ashamed and he replied for all that senor neptune
it will not do to vex senor jupiter remain where you are and some other
day when there is a better opportunity and more time we will come back
for you so they stripped the licentiate and he was left where he was
so thats the story master barber said don quixote which came in so
pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it master shaver
master shaver how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve is it
possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit valour
with valour beauty with beauty birth with birth are always odious and
unwelcome i master barber am not neptune the god of the waters nor
do i try to make anyone take me for an astute man for i am not one my
only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not
reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight errantry was
in the field but our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a
blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights errant took upon their
shoulders the defence of kingdoms the protection of damsels the succour
of orphans and minors the chastisement of the proud and the recompense
of the humble with the knights of these days for the most part it is
the damask brocade and rich stuffs they wear that rustle as they go
not the chain mail of their armour no knight now a days sleeps in the
open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven and in full panoply from
head to foot no one now takes a nap as they call it without drawing
his feet out of the stirrups and leaning upon his lance as the
knights errant used to do no one now issuing from the wood penetrates
yonder mountains and then treads the barren lonely shore of the
sea mostly a tempestuous and stormy one and finding on the beach a
little bark without oars sail mast or tackling of any kind in the
intrepidity of his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to
the wrathful billows of the deep sea that one moment lift him up to
heaven and the next plunge him into the depths and opposing his breast
to the irresistible gale finds himself when he least expects it three
thousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked and
leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve
to be written not on parchment but on brass but now sloth triumphs
over energy indolence over exertion vice over virtue arrogance over
courage and theory over practice in arms which flourished and shone
only in the golden ages and in knights errant for tell me who was more
virtuous and more valiant than the famous amadis of gaul who more
discreet than palmerin of england who more gracious and easy than
tirante el blanco who more courtly than lisuarte of greece who more
slashed or slashing than don belianis who more intrepid than perion of
gaul who more ready to face danger than felixmarte of hircania who more
sincere than esplandian who more impetuous than don cirongilio of
thrace who more bold than rodamonte who more prudent than king sobrino
who more daring than reinaldos who more invincible than roland and who
more gallant and courteous than ruggiero from whom the dukes of ferrara
of the present day are descended according to turpin in his
cosmography all these knights and many more that i could name senor
curate were knights errant the light and glory of chivalry these or
such as these i would have to carry out my plan and in that case his
majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense and
the turk would be left tearing his beard and so i will stay where i am
as the chaplain does not take me away and if jupiter as the barber has
told us will not send rain here am i and i will rain when i please i
say this that master basin may know that i understand him
indeed senor don quixote said the barber i did not mean it in that
way and so help me god my intention was good and your worship ought
as to whether i ought to be vexed or not returned don quixote i
hereupon the curate observed i have hardly said a word as yet and i
would gladly be relieved of a doubt arising from what don quixote has
the senor curate has leave for more than that returned don quixote
so he may declare his doubt for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on
well then with that permission said the curate i say my doubt is
that all i can do i cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of
knights errant you senor don quixote have mentioned were really and
truly persons of flesh and blood that ever lived in the world on the
contrary i suspect it to be all fiction fable and falsehood and
dreams told by men awakened from sleep or rather still half asleep
that is another mistake replied don quixote into which many have
fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world
and i have often with divers people and on divers occasions tried to
expose this almost universal error to the light of truth sometimes i
have not been successful in my purpose sometimes i have supporting it
upon the shoulders of the truth which truth is so clear that i can
almost say i have with my own eyes seen amadis of gaul who was a man of
lofty stature fair complexion with a handsome though black beard of a
countenance between gentle and stern in expression sparing of words
slow to anger and quick to put it away from him and as i have depicted
amadis so i could i think portray and describe all the knights errant
that are in all the histories in the world for by the perception i have
that they were what their histories describe and by the deeds they did
and the dispositions they displayed it is possible with the aid of
sound philosophy to deduce their features complexion and stature
how big in your worships opinion may the giant morgante have been
with regard to giants replied don quixote opinions differ as to
whether there ever were any or not in the world but the holy scripture
which cannot err by a jot from the truth shows us that there were when
it gives us the history of that big philistine goliath who was seven
cubits and a half in height which is a huge size likewise in the
island of sicily there have been found leg bones and arm bones so large
that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants and as tall
as great towers geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt but for all
that i cannot speak with certainty as to the size of morgante though i
suspect he cannot have been very tall and i am inclined to be of this
opinion because i find in the history in which his deeds are particularly
mentioned that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses
to contain him it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything
that is true said the curate and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing
such nonsense he asked him what was his notion of the features of
reinaldos of montalban and don roland and the rest of the twelve peers
of france for they were all knights errant
as for reinaldos replied don quixote i venture to say that he was
broad faced of ruddy complexion with roguish and somewhat prominent
eyes excessively punctilious and touchy and given to the society of
thieves and scapegraces with regard to roland or rotolando or orlando
for the histories call him by all these names i am of opinion and
hold that he was of middle height broad shouldered rather bow legged
swarthy complexioned red bearded with a hairy body and a severe
expression of countenance a man of few words but very polite and
if roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has
described said the curate it is no wonder that the fair lady angelica
rejected him and left him for the gaiety liveliness and grace of that
budding bearded little moor to whom she surrendered herself and she
showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of medoro
that angelica senor curate returned don quixote was a giddy damsel
flighty and somewhat wanton and she left the world as full of her
vagaries as of the fame of her beauty she treated with scorn a thousand
gentlemen men of valour and wisdom and took up with a smooth faced
sprig of a page without fortune or fame except such reputation for
gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him the great poet
who sang her beauty the famous ariosto not caring to sing her
adventures after her contemptible surrender which probably were not over
and above creditable dropped her where he says
some bard of defter quill may sing some day
and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy for poets are also called
vates that is to say diviners and its truth was made plain for since
then a famous andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears and
another famous and rare poet a castilian has sung her beauty
tell me senor don quixote said the barber here among all those who
praised her has there been no poet to write a satire on this lady
i can well believe replied don quixote that if sacripante or roland
had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming for it is
naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected by their
ladies whether fictitious or not in short by those whom they select as
the ladies of their thoughts to avenge themselves in satires and
libels a vengeance to be sure unworthy of generous hearts but up to
the present i have not heard of any defamatory verse against the lady
strange said the curate but at this moment they heard the housekeeper
and the niece who had previously withdrawn from the conversation
exclaiming aloud in the courtyard and at the noise they all ran out
which treats of the notable altercation which sancho panza had with don
quixotes niece and housekeeper together with other droll matters
the history relates that the outcry don quixote the curate and the
barber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to
sancho who was striving to force his way in to see don quixote while
they held the door against him what does the vagabond want in this
house be off to your own brother for it is you and no one else that
delude my master and lead him astray and take him tramping about the
to which sancho replied devils own housekeeper it is i who am
deluded and led astray and taken tramping about the country and not
thy master he has carried me all over the world and you are mightily
mistaken he enticed me away from home by a trick promising me an
may evil islands choke thee thou detestable sancho said the niece
what are islands is it something to eat glutton and gormandiser that
it is not something to eat replied sancho but something to govern
and rule and better than four cities or four judgeships at court
for all that said the housekeeper you dont enter here you bag of
mischief and sack of knavery go govern your house and dig your
seed patch and give over looking for islands or shylands
the curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of
the three but don quixote uneasy lest sancho should blab and blurt out
a whole heap of mischievous stupidities and touch upon points that might
not be altogether to his credit called to him and made the other two
hold their tongues and let him come in sancho entered and the curate
and the barber took their leave of don quixote of whose recovery they
despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas and how
saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry and said the curate
to the barber you will see gossip that when we are least thinking of
it our gentleman will be off once more for another flight
i have no doubt of it returned the barber but i do not wonder so
much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire who
has such a firm belief in all that about the island that i suppose all
the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his head
god help them said the curate and let us be on the look out to see
what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire for it
seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould and the madness of
the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a
that is true said the barber and i should like very much to know
what the pair are talking about at this moment
i promise you said the curate the niece or the housekeeper will tell
us by and by for they are not the ones to forget to listen
meanwhile don quixote shut himself up in his room with sancho and when
they were alone he said to him it grieves me greatly sancho that thou
shouldst have said and sayest that i took thee out of thy cottage when
thou knowest i did not remain in my house we sallied forth together we
took the road together we wandered abroad together we have had the same
fortune and the same luck if they blanketed thee once they belaboured
me a hundred times and that is the only advantage i have of thee
that was only reasonable replied sancho for by what your worship
says misfortunes belong more properly to knights errant than to their
thou art mistaken sancho said don quixote according to the maxim
i dont understand any language but my own said sancho
i mean to say said don quixote that when the head suffers all the
members suffer and so being thy lord and master i am thy head and
thou a part of me as thou art my servant and therefore any evil that
affects or shall affect me should give thee pain and what affects thee
it should be so said sancho but when i was blanketed as a member my
head was on the other side of the wall looking on while i was flying
through the air and did not feel any pain whatever and if the members
are obliged to feel the suffering of the head it should be obliged to
dost thou mean to say now sancho said don quixote that i did not
feel when they were blanketing thee if thou dost thou must not say so
or think so for i felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in body
but let us put that aside for the present for we shall have
opportunities enough for considering and settling the point tell me
sancho my friend what do they say about me in the village here what do
the common people think of me what do the hidalgos what do the
caballeros what do they say of my valour of my achievements of my
courtesy how do they treat the task i have undertaken in reviving and
restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry in short
sancho i would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this
subject and thou art to tell me without adding anything to the good or
taking away anything from the bad for it is the duty of loyal vassals to
tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape not
allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it and i
would have thee know sancho that if the naked truth undisguised by
flattery came to the ears of princes times would be different and
other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours which i hold to be
the golden of these latter days profit by this advice sancho and
report to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest
that i will do with all my heart master replied sancho provided
your worship will not be vexed at what i say as you wish me to say it
out in all its nakedness without putting any more clothes on it than it
i will not be vexed at all returned don quixote thou mayest speak
freely sancho and without any beating about the bush
well then said he first of all i have to tell you that the common
people consider your worship a mighty great madman and me no less a
fool the hidalgos say that not keeping within the bounds of your
quality of gentleman you have assumed the don and made a knight of
yourself at a jump with four vine stocks and a couple of acres of land
and never a shirt to your back the caballeros say they do not want to
have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them particularly squire
hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with
that said don quixote does not apply to me for i always go well
dressed and never patched ragged i may be but ragged more from the wear
as to your worships valour courtesy accomplishments and task there
is a variety of opinions some say mad but droll others valiant but
unlucky others courteous but meddling and then they go into such a
number of things that they dont leave a whole bone either in your
recollect sancho said don quixote that wherever virtue exists in an
eminent degree it is persecuted few or none of the famous men that have
lived escaped being calumniated by malice julius caesar the boldest
wisest and bravest of captains was charged with being ambitious and
not particularly cleanly in his dress or pure in his morals of
alexander whose deeds won him the name of great they say that he was
somewhat of a drunkard of hercules him of the many labours it is said
that he was lewd and luxurious of don galaor the brother of amadis of
gaul it was whispered that he was over quarrelsome and of his brother
that he was lachrymose so that o sancho amongst all these calumnies
against good men mine may be let pass since they are no more than thou
thats just where it is body of my father
theres the tail to be skinned yet said sancho all so far is cakes
and fancy bread but if your worship wants to know all about the
calumnies they bring against you i will fetch you one this instant who
can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom for last night
the son of bartholomew carrasco who has been studying at salamanca came
home after having been made a bachelor and when i went to welcome him
he told me that your worships history is already abroad in books with
the title of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha and he
says they mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza and the lady
dulcinea del toboso too and divers things that happened to us when we
were alone so that i crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who
i promise thee sancho said don quixote the author of our history
will be some sage enchanter for to such nothing that they choose to
what said sancho a sage and an enchanter why the bachelor samson
carrasco that is the name of him i spoke of says the author of the
that is a moorish name said don quixote
may be so replied sancho for i have heard say that the moors are
thou must have mistaken the surname of this cide which means in
very likely replied sancho but if your worship wishes me to fetch
the bachelor i will go for him in a twinkling
thou wilt do me a great pleasure my friend said don quixote for
what thou hast told me has amazed me and i shall not eat a morsel that
will agree with me until i have heard all about it
then i am off for him said sancho and leaving his master he went in
quest of the bachelor with whom he returned in a short time and all
three together they had a very droll colloquy
of the laughable conversation that passed between don quixote sancho
don quixote remained very deep in thought waiting for the bachelor
carrasco from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a
book as sancho said and he could not persuade himself that any such
history could be in existence for the blood of the enemies he had slain
was not yet dry on the blade of his sword and now they wanted to make
out that his mighty achievements were going about in print for all that
he fancied some sage either a friend or an enemy might by the aid of
magic have given them to the press if a friend in order to magnify and
exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight errant if
an enemy to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever
recorded of any low squire though as he said to himself the
achievements of squires never were recorded if however it were the
fact that such a history were in existence it must necessarily being
the story of a knight errant be grandiloquent lofty imposing grand
and true with this he comforted himself somewhat though it made him
uncomfortable to think that the author was a moor judging by the title
of cide and that no truth was to be looked for from moors as they are
all impostors cheats and schemers he was afraid he might have dealt
with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion that might tend to the
discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady dulcinea del toboso he
would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always
observed towards her spurning queens empresses and damsels of all
sorts and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses
absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations he was
found by sancho and carrasco whom don quixote received with great
the bachelor though he was called samson was of no great bodily size
but he was a very great wag he was of a sallow complexion but very
sharp witted somewhere about four and twenty years of age with a round
face a flat nose and a large mouth all indications of a mischievous
disposition and a love of fun and jokes and of this he gave a sample as
soon as he saw don quixote by falling on his knees before him and
saying let me kiss your mightinesss hand senor don quixote of la
mancha for by the habit of st peter that i wear though i have no more
than the first four orders your worship is one of the most famous
knights errant that have ever been or will be all the world over a
blessing on cide hamete benengeli who has written the history of your
great deeds and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the
trouble of having it translated out of the arabic into our castilian
vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people
don quixote made him rise and said so then it is true that there is
a history of me and that it was a moor and a sage who wrote it
so true is it senor said samson that my belief is there are more
than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very day
only ask portugal barcelona and valencia where they have been printed
and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at antwerp and i
am persuaded there will not be a country or language in which there will
one of the things here observed don quixote that ought to give most
pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his lifetime
in print and in type familiar in peoples mouths with a good name i say
with a good name for if it be the opposite then there is no death to be
if it goes by good name and fame said the bachelor your worship
alone bears away the palm from all the knights errant for the moor in
his own language and the christian in his have taken care to set before
us your gallantry your high courage in encountering dangers your
fortitude in adversity your patience under misfortunes as well as
wounds the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship
i never heard my lady dulcinea called dona observed sancho here
nothing more than the lady dulcinea del toboso so here already the
that is not an objection of any importance replied carrasco
certainly not said don quixote but tell me senor bachelor what
deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history
on that point replied the bachelor opinions differ as tastes do
some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to be
briareuses and giants others by that of the fulling mills one cries up
the description of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of
two droves of sheep another that of the dead body on its way to be
buried at segovia a third says the liberation of the galley slaves is
the best of all and a fourth that nothing comes up to the affair with
the benedictine giants and the battle with the valiant biscayan
tell me senor bachelor said sancho at this point does the adventure
with the yanguesans come in when our good rocinante went hankering after
the sage has left nothing in the ink bottle replied samson he tells
all and sets down everything even to the capers that worthy sancho cut
i cut no capers in the blanket returned sancho in the air i did and
