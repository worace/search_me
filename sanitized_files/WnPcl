development by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the
general temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons
power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of
this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at
every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a
chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after
entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway
to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the
sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never
observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant
forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient
components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action
specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration
of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the
will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this
opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of
1813 and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside
alexanders will such as the activity of stein metternich madame de
stael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian
evidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrand
chateaubriand and the rest but the sum of the components that is the
interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and the
others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of
millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand
madame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another only
affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission
of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
the submission of millions of people resulted that is how component
forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a the
historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had
denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he
has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is
just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only
peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to
whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds
away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the
universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with
their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes
when they want to prove something else say that power produces events
a third class of historians the so called historians of culture
following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes
accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that
force to be something quite different they see it in what is called
the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical
events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that
such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of
indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select
the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is
the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events
lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit
that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the
movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual
activity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed by
such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting
from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and
but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by
some undefined force called an idea historys essential question still
remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the
influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
historians another newer force the idea is added the connection of
which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand
that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may
even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause
of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making
frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event
undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously
and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
activity of men and their historical movements just as such a
connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce
handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual
activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or
expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only
the following considerations can have led the historians to such a
conclusion 1 that history is written by learned men and so it is
natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar
belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers
if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers
do not write history and 2 that spiritual activity enlightenment
civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions
under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind
which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the
histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more
to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and
doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an
actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance they
involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and
say plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking so
the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show
that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens
in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a
a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says
the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its
wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to
refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or
another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the
contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who
says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for
having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why
the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the
movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he
has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains
the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has
noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the
first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an
the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
that of a force commensurate with the movement observed
the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that
of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples
yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement
observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the
peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting
from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again
as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away
so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether
caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of
all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite
impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end
and the only such conception known to historians is that of power
this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who
breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method
of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one
possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of
power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the
universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they
professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
in dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now is
like money in circulation paper money and coin the biographies and
special national histories are like paper money they can be used and
can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even
advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them
you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and
such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may
perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real
value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much
of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also
doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
someone inquires by what force did napoleon do this that is wants to
exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to
substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than
that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by
tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is
gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use
so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
historys essential question what is power the universal historians
give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of
culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters
of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to
accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold
so universal historians and historians of culture not answering
humanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes of
their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a
having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection
of that mans will to the deity history cannot without contradictions
take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return
to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human
affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and
so it is essential to explain what is meant by power
napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so
accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question
why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered
certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he
this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to
determine what is this power of one man over others
it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one
a domination based on the application or threat of physical force like
the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force
as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading
figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special
strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on
the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as
napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history
shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over
millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the
contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for
elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the
and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence
that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys
power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or
in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a
state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be
arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that
the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients
regarded fire namely as something existing absolutely but for
history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern
physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon
from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell
minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power
existing immutably outside time is but to historys questions about
the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing
if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not
then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was
taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom
do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take
part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international
relations is the will of the people also transferred to their
conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to
napoleon in 1806 was the will of the russian people transferred to
napoleon in 1809 when our army in alliance with the french went to
either to assume 1 that the will of the people is always
unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and
that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against
the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an
infringement of the real power or 2 that the will of the people is
transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known
conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even
destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the
conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or 3 that
the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but
that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance
of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely
from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown
conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some
and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the
some historians those biographical and specialist historians already
referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of
the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the
people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and
therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular
power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force
opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence
their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history
has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in
the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and
struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that
the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere
infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will
prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the
real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently
the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of
historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will
of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power
only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the
people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program
consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually
each historian according to his view of what constitutes a nations
progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom
or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to
mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program
or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions
exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory if
the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth
freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and
ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and
charles i are executed by their people to this question historians
reply that louis xivs activity contrary to the program reacted on
louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why
should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such
reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally
little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then
suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii
to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican
government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers
of the peoples will from one individual to another especially in view
of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are
obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning on
mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a
party leader so that the greater part of the events of history civil
wars revolutions and conquests are presented by these historians not
as the results of free transferences of the peoples will but as
results of the ill directed will of one or more individuals that is
once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see
and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory
these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some
plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all
that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the
mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer
resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory
historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is
transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the
conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have
power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been
but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the
historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have
the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people
the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people
but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some part
of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
the peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details of
the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a
catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident
nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
historical leader which serves to express the peoples life as other
so called philosophical historians believe then to determine which
side of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we have
first of all to know in what the nations life consists
met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all
conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost
all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress
civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal
of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the
greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals
authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in
their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction
but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in
freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection
of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based
on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the
activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture
and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice
history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the
west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward
explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses
and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot
is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia
expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by
is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by
the life and activity of the godfreys and the louis es and their ladies
for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders
with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains
incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance
of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders popes
kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the
people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled
them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the
minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the
history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of
godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples
still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a
hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was
suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after
the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the
if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest
historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not
the history of the life of the peoples
the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for
the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the
theory that this connection is based on the transference of the
collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to
historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence
and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as
soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occur that is as soon as
the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the
peoples will cannot be verified for it never occurred
whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the
theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different
parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute
the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head
the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it
and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
leader this is what historians of the first class say those who
assume the unconditional transference of the peoples will
if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the
collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in
the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians
who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers
under conditions which they regard as known with this method of
observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the
direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the
peoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one side
if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow
a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we
must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all
historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of
the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other
what causes historical events power what is power power is the
collective will of the people transferred to one person under what
condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on
condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that
is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which
if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning
then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that
juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely
a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has
besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his
reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is
proved both by history and by observing contemporary events
whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the
event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the
french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and
an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters
russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the
bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it
the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the
expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that
supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience
on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans will
his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event
as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an
incomprehensible supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that
words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on
the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of
events history shows that the expression of the will of historical
personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say
their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite
without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
cannot regard power as the cause of events
power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that
exists between the expression of someones will and the execution of
to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a
conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the
if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history
tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not
caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but
speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of
commands with events we must restore 1 the condition of all that
takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
of the person who commands and 2 the inevitability of the connection
between the person commanding and those who execute his command
only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can
relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or
centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his
sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man acts
in time and himself takes part in what occurs
reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no
command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
rendering the execution of the last command possible
no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series
of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers
to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event
when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we
combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an
invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such
papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow
such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the
commissariat and so on and so on millions of commands which formed a
whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of
england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort
and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he
considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly
expressed this came about because his commands did not correspond to
the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the
for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should
order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be
executed is impossible not only in the case of napoleons invasion of
russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event
for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
execution every order executed is always one of an immense number
unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a
consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and
our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
event have been executed we forget about the others that were not
executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of
our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such
for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is
generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole
series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will
we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality
in all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling an
expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of
his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series
of unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of 1812
was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the
other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work
this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over
so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we
find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a
to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
the deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the command
this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
called power this relation consists in the following
for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which
regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the
relation between those taking part in it is always the same
men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the
smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which
of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
the most striking and definite examples is an army
every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and
file of whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher
military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are
fewer and of still higher officers of whom there are still fewer and
so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one
a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of
which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file
the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next
higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which
the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the
cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking
burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions
from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned
officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less
frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer
still less often acts directly himself but commands still more
frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the
objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief
never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general
orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar
relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
for common activity in agriculture trade and every administration
and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a
cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any
administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the
highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine
in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing
the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are
while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more
they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from
the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share
in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding
this relation of the men who command to those they command is what
constitutes the essence of the conception called power
having restored the condition of time under which all events occur we
find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of
relation between those who command and those who execute we find that
by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part
in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to
when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many
people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is
fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is
done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power
in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not
think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what
would result from the common activity while the man who commanded more
would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim
there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is
given to directing and commanding take less part in the direct work
when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present
activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is
done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct
part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and
for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill
one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in
peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for
liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this
event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a
centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from
the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was
accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of
england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the
events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of
killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing
of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these
justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day
these justifications release those who produce the events from moral
responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear
without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
question that presents itself when examining each historical event how
is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war commit
with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe
can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs
ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any
collective action which cannot find its justification in political
unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so
that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of
the will of one man or of several men
in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will
always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the
movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion
only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and
comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that
every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and
that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
characters that is re establish the inevitable condition of all that
occurs the continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the
essential connection of historical persons with the masses
when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave
ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns
frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and
decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither
directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance
seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ships
examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that
the events depended on those commands but examining the events
themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many
commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are
other causes for it but as soon as an event occurs be it what it may
then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people
some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of
utterance are related as commands to the events
arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
2 what force produces the movement of the nations
1 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in
which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and
justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is
2 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual
activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the
events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the
largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least
morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it
is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is
inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in
the one nor in the other but in the union of the two
or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the
in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit
to which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is not
playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces
electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another
speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we
cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is
inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the
same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do
not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action
people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and
we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other
if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this
simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter
cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history
says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law
the presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed is
all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the
false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of
if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he
pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents
if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that
is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans in
violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity
if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot
exist for then mans will is subject to that law
in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most
ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance
the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from
whatever point of view theological historical ethical or
philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he like all
that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what
we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free
this consciousness is a source of self cognition quite apart from and
independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only
apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be
conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a
living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his
volition but his will which forms the essence of his life man
if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one
and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food
using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this never
varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were
it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to him to be
limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free
you say i am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall
everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to
if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent
source of self consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to
experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is
a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an
object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to
them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has
become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and
arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on
his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet
man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments
having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does
however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that
he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however
incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which
constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels
that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception
of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would
be unable to live for a single moment
he could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to life
are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and
obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and
disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger
virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom
a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and
the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only
proves that consciousness is not subject to reason
this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by
experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man
is possible constitutes the other side of the question
man is the creation of an all powerful all good and all seeing god
what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
mans freedom that is a question for theology
the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in
statistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception of
which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for
mans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting
upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in
actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a
