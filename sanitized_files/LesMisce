the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la
chanvrerie two other cannons trained one from the rue saint denis
the other from the rue aubry le boucher were riddling the saint merry
barricade the four cannons echoed each other mournfully
the barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other
one of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the rue
de la chanvrerie was firing grape shot the other balls
the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim
was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper
crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents
the object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from
the summit of the redoubt and to compel them to gather close in the
interior that is to say this announced the assault
the combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls
and from the windows of the cabaret by grape shot the attacking columns
could venture into the street without being picked off perhaps even
without being seen could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt as on
the preceding evening and who knows take it by surprise
it is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns
should be diminished said enjolras and he shouted fire on the
all were ready the barricade which had long been silent poured forth
a desperate fire seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of
rage and joy the street was filled with blinding smoke and at the end
of a few minutes athwart this mist all streaked with flame two thirds
of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the
cannons those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with
things are going well now said bossuet to enjolras success
another quarter of an hour of this success and there will not be any
courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the
barricade outside in the street amid the bullets
gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine shop had made his
way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying the full
cartridge boxes of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the
and with a single bound he plunged into the street
it will be remembered that fannicots company had left behind it a trail
of bodies twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement
through the whole length of the street twenty cartouches for gavroche
meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade
the smoke in the street was like a fog whoever has beheld a cloud which
has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can
imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of
lofty houses it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a
twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants
could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other
this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the
commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful
beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size
he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen he
rifled the first seven or eight cartridge boxes without much danger
he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket
in his teeth twisted glided undulated wound from one dead body to
another and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a
they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which
was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him
on one body that of a corporal he found a powder flask
for thirst said he putting it in his pocket
by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade
became transparent so that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on
the outlook behind their paving stone dike and the sharpshooters of the
banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each
at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant who was lying near
a stone door post of his cartridges a bullet struck the body
fichtre ejaculated gavroche they are killing my dead men for me
a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him a third
gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue
he sprang to his feet stood erect with his hair flying in the wind
his hands on his hips his eyes fixed on the national guardsmen who were
on est laid a nanterre men are ugly at nanterre
cest la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire
et bete a palaiseau and dull at palaiseau
cest la faute a rousseau tis the fault of rousseau
then he picked up his basket replaced the cartridges which had fallen
from it without missing a single one and advancing towards the
fusillade set about plundering another cartridge box there a fourth
je ne suis pas notaire i am not a notary
cest la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire
je suis un petit oiseau im a little bird
cest la faute a rousseau tis the fault of rousseau
a fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet
joie est mon caractere joy is my character
cest la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire
misere est mon trousseau misery is my trousseau
cest la faute a rousseau tis the fault of rousseau
it was a charming and terrible sight gavroche though shot at was
teasing the fusillade he had the air of being greatly diverted it was
the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen to each discharge he retorted
with a couplet they aimed at him constantly and always missed him the
national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him he
lay down sprang to his feet hid in the corner of a doorway then made
a bound disappeared re appeared scampered away returned replied to
the grape shot with his thumb at his nose and all the while went on
pillaging the cartouches emptying the cartridge boxes and filling his
basket the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their
eyes the barricade trembled he sang he was not a child he was not
a man he was a strange gamin fairy he might have been called the
invulnerable dwarf of the fray the bullets flew after him he was more
nimble than they he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death
every time that the flat nosed face of the spectre approached the
one bullet however better aimed or more treacherous than the rest
finally struck the will o the wisp of a child gavroche was seen to
stagger then he sank to the earth the whole barricade gave vent to a
cry but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy for the gamin
to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth
gavroche had fallen only to rise again he remained in a sitting
posture a long thread of blood streaked his face he raised both arms
in the air glanced in the direction whence the shot had come and began
je suis tombe par terre i have fallen to the earth
cest la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire
le nez dans le ruisseau with my nose in the gutter
cest la faute a     tis the fault of    
he did not finish a second bullet from the same marksman stopped him
short this time he fell face downward on the pavement and moved no
more this grand little soul had taken its flight
chapter xvi how from a brother one becomes a father
at that same moment in the garden of the luxembourg for the gaze of
the drama must be everywhere present two children were holding each
other by the hand one might have been seven years old the other five
the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on
the sunny side the elder was leading the younger they were pale and
ragged they had the air of wild birds the smaller of them said i am
the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his
brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick
they were alone in the garden the garden was deserted the gates had
been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection the
troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of
how did those children come there perhaps they had escaped from some
guard house which stood ajar perhaps there was in the vicinity at
the barriere denfer or on the esplanade de lobservatoire or in the
neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read
invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum some mountebanks booth from which
they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the
eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had
passed the night in some one of those sentry boxes where people read the
papers the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free to be
astray and to seem free is to be lost these poor little creatures were
these two children were the same over whom gavroche had been put to
some trouble as the reader will recollect children of the thenardiers
leased out to magnon attributed to m gillenormand and now leaves
fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by
the wind their clothing which had been clean in magnons day and
which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand had been
henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned
children whom the police take note of collect mislay and find again
it required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these
miserable little creatures being in that garden if the superintendents
had caught sight of them they would have driven such rags forth poor
little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect
that as children they have a right to flowers
these children were there thanks to the locked gates they were there
contrary to the regulations they had slipped into the garden and there
they remained closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight
is supposed to continue but it grows slack and reposes and the
inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the
outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and had not
it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning but
in june showers do not count for much an hour after a storm it can
hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept the earth in
summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child at that period of
the solstice the light of full noonday is so to speak poignant it
takes everything it applies itself to the earth and superposes itself
with a sort of suction one would say that the sun was thirsty a shower
is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up in the
morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered
nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and
wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness the gardens and
meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become
perfuming pans of incense and smoke with all their odors at
once everything smiles sings and offers itself one feels gently
intoxicated the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man
there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having
the azure of heaven say it is enough dreamers absorbed in the
wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and
evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not
understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these
and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the
lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the
attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they
can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and
pitilessly satisfied strange to say the infinite suffices them that
great need of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore
the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil they do not
think about the indefinite which is born from the human and divine
combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them provided that
they are face to face with immensity they smile joy never ecstasy
forever their life lies in surrendering their personality in
contemplation the history of humanity is for them only a detailed
plan all is not there the true all remains without what is the use
of busying oneself over that detail man man suffers that is quite
possible but look at aldebaran rising the mother has no more milk the
new born babe is dying i know nothing about that but just look at this
wonderful rosette which a slice of wood cells of the pine presents under
the microscope compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you
can these thinkers forget to love the zodiac thrives with them to such
a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child god eclipses
their souls this is a family of minds which are at once great and
petty horace was one of them so was goethe la fontaine perhaps
magnificent egoists of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who
do not behold nero if the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the
funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the
search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the sob nor
the death rattle nor the alarm peal for whom everything is well since
there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple
and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are
determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of
these are dark radiances they have no suspicion that they are to be
pitied certainly they are so he who does not weep does not see they
are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being
at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star
the indifference of these thinkers is according to some a superior
philosophy that may be but in this superiority there is some
infirmity one may be immortal and yet limp witness vulcan one may
be more than man and less than man there is incomplete immensity in
nature who knows whether the sun is not a blind man
but then what in whom can we trust solem quis dicere falsum audeat
who shall dare to say that the sun is false thus certain geniuses
themselves certain very lofty mortals man stars may be mistaken that
which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which
sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly sees
not at all is not this a desperate state of things no but what is
on the 6th of june 1832 about eleven oclock in the morning the
luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming the quincunxes and
flower beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight the
branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring
to embrace in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets sparrows
triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering
little pecks on the bark the flower beds accepted the legitimate
royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which
emanates from whiteness the peppery odor of the carnations was
perceptible the old crows of marie de medici were amorous in the tall
trees the sun gilded empurpled set fire to and lighted up the tulips
which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers all
around the banks of tulips the bees the sparks of these flame flowers
hummed all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse
by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to
profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the
charming threat of flying low he who was there aspired to happiness
life smelled good all nature exhaled candor help assistance
paternity caress dawn the thoughts which fell from heaven were as
sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it
the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced
with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight rays hung
from them on all sides around the great fountain the earth was already
dried up to the point of being burnt there was sufficient breeze to
raise little insurrections of dust here and there a few yellow leaves
left over from the autumn chased each other merrily and seemed to be
this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it
life sap heat odors overflowed one was conscious beneath creation
of the enormous size of the source in all these breaths permeated with
love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this
marvellous expenditure of rays in this infinite outpouring of liquid
gold one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible and behind this
splendor as behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that
thanks to the sand there was not a speck of mud thanks to the rain
there was not a grain of ashes the clumps of blossoms had just been
bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs
from the earth in the form of flowers was irreproachable this
magnificence was cleanly the grand silence of happy nature filled the
garden a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of
music the cooing of nests the buzzing of swarms the flutterings of
the breeze all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious
whole the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order the
lilacs ended the jasmines began some flowers were tardy some insects
in advance of their time the van guard of the red june butterflies
fraternized with the rear guard of the white butterflies of may the
plantain trees were getting their new skins the breeze hollowed out
undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut trees it
was splendid a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing
through the fence said here is the spring presenting arms and in full
all nature was breakfasting creation was at table this was its hour
the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth
on earth the sun lighted it all up brilliantly god was serving
the universal repast each creature had his pasture or his mess the
ring dove found his hemp seed the chaffinch found his millet the
goldfinch found chickweed the red breast found worms the green finch
found flies the fly found infusoriae the bee found flowers they ate
each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with
good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach
the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the
grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light they tried to
hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence
of even impersonal magnificence and they kept behind the swans hutch
here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort
of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and dull blows which
were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly smoke hung over
the roofs in the direction of the halles a bell which had the air of
these children did not appear to notice these noises the little one
repeated from time to time i am hungry
almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached
the great basin they consisted of a goodman about fifty years of age
who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six no doubt a father
and his son the little man of six had a big brioche
at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the rues madame
and denfer had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers
enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was
suppressed later on this father and son came from one of these houses
the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and
he was a bourgeois the same person perhaps whom marius had one day
heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling
his son to avoid excesses he had an affable and haughty air and a
mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut this mechanical
smile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth
rather than the soul the child with his brioche which he had bitten
into but had not finished eating seemed satiated the child was dressed
as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had
remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence
father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting
this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans
he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them
for the moment the swans were swimming which is their principal
if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an
age to understand they might have gathered the words of this grave man
the sage lives content with little look at me my son i do not love
pomp i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i
leave that false splendor to badly organized souls
here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the halles
burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar
all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the
in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brioche spit it out and
what are you crying about demanded his father
i am not hungry any more said the child
one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake
the child hesitated a person may not want any more of his cake but
that is no reason for giving it away
be humane you must have compassion on animals
and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin
the swans were far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some
prey they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche
the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and
moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation
which finally attracted the attention of the swans
they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as
they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the
the swans cygnes understand signs signes said the bourgeois
at that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden
increase this time it was sinister there are some gusts of wind which
speak more distinctly than others the one which was blowing at that
moment brought clearly defined drum beats clamors platoon firing and
the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon this coincided with a
the swans had not yet reached the brioche
let us return home said the father they are attacking the
he grasped his sons hand again then he continued
from the tuileries to the luxembourg there is but the distance which
separates royalty from the peerage that is not far shots will soon
perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down the sky
is joining in the younger branch is condemned let us return home
i should like to see the swans eat the brioche said the child
the son regretting the swans turned his head back toward the basin
until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him
in the meanwhile the two little waifs had approached the brioche at
the same time as the swans it was floating on the water the smaller of
them stared at the cake the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois
father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand
flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the rue madame
as soon as they had disappeared from view the elder child hastily
flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin and
clinging to it with his left hand and leaning over the water on the
verge of falling in he stretched out his right hand with his stick
towards the cake the swans perceiving the enemy made haste and in so
doing they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to
the little fisher the water flowed back before the swans and one of
these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards
the childs wand just as the swans came up the stick touched the cake
the child gave it a brisk rap drew in the brioche frightened away the
swans seized the cake and sprang to his feet the cake was wet
but they were hungry and thirsty the elder broke the cake into two
portions a large one and a small one took the small one for himself
gave the large one to his brother and said to him
marius dashed out of the barricade combeferre followed him but he
was too late gavroche was dead combeferre brought back the basket of
alas he thought that which the father had done for his father he
was requiting to the son only thenardier had brought back his father
alive he was bringing back the child dead
when marius re entered the redoubt with gavroche in his arms his face
at the moment when he had stooped to lift gavroche a bullet had grazed
courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged marius brow
they laid gavroche on the same table with mabeuf and spread over the
two corpses the black shawl there was enough of it for both the old man
combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had
this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire
jean valjean was still in the same place motionless on his stone post
when combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges he shook his head
heres a rare eccentric said combeferre in a low voice to enjolras
he finds a way of not fighting in this barricade
which does not prevent him from defending it responded enjolras
one thing which must be noted is that the fire which was battering the
barricade hardly disturbed the interior those who have never traversed
the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular
moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions men go and
come they talk they jest they lounge some one whom we know heard a
combatant say to him in the midst of the grape shot we are here as
at a bachelor breakfast the redoubt of the rue de la chanvrerie we
repeat seemed very calm within all mutations and all phases had been
or were about to be exhausted the position from critical had become
menacing and from menacing was probably about to become desperate in
proportion as the situation grew gloomy the glow of heroism empurpled
the barricade more and more enjolras who was grave dominated it
in the attitude of a young spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the
combeferre wearing an apron was dressing the wounds bossuet and
feuilly were making cartridges with the powder flask picked up by
gavroche on the dead corporal and bossuet said to feuilly we are soon
to take the diligence for another planet courfeyrac was disposing and
arranging on some paving stones which he had reserved for himself near
enjolras a complete arsenal his sword cane his gun two holster
pistols and a cudgel with the care of a young girl setting a small
dunkerque in order jean valjean stared silently at the wall opposite
him an artisan was fastening mother hucheloups big straw hat on his
head with a string for fear of sun stroke as he said the young
men from the cougourde daix were chatting merrily among themselves
as though eager to speak patois for the last time joly who had taken
widow hucheloups mirror from the wall was examining his tongue in it
some combatants having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread
in a drawer were eagerly devouring them marius was disturbed with
regard to what his father was about to say to him
we must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades
nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets
whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have
just mentioned the barricade for those who are inside it remains
there is something of the apocalypse in civil war all the mists of the
unknown are commingled with fierce flashes revolutions are sphinxes
and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a
the feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out
in the case of marius and we shall see the consequences they are both
more and less than life on emerging from a barricade one no longer
knows what one has seen there one has been terrible but one knows
it not one has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human
faces ones head has been in the light of the future there were
corpses lying prone there and phantoms standing erect the hours were
colossal and seemed hours of eternity one has lived in death shadows
one has beheld hands on which there was blood there was a deafening
horror there was also a frightful silence there were open mouths which
shouted and other open mouths which held their peace one was in the
midst of smoke of night perhaps one fancied that one had touched the
sinister ooze of unknown depths one stares at something red on ones
let us return to the rue de la chanvrerie
all at once between two discharges the distant sound of a clock
the twelve strokes had not finished striking when enjolras sprang to his
feet and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout
carry stones up into the houses line the windowsills and the
roofs with them half the men to their guns the other half to the
paving stones there is not a minute to be lost
a squad of sappers and miners axe on shoulder had just made their
appearance in battle array at the end of the street
this could only be the head of a column and of what column the
attacking column evidently the sappers charged with the demolition of
the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it
they were evidently on the brink of that moment which m
clermont tonnerre in 1822 called the tug of war
enjolras order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar
to ships and barricades the only two scenes of combat where escape
is impossible in less than a minute two thirds of the stones which
enjolras had had piled up at the door of corinthe had been carried up to
the first floor and the attic and before a second minute had elapsed
these stones artistically set one upon the other walled up the
sash window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their
height a few loop holes carefully planned by feuilly the principal
architect allowed of the passage of the gun barrels this armament of
the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of
grape shot had ceased the two cannons were now discharging ball
against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there and if
when the stones destined to the final defence were in place enjolras
had the bottles which he had set under the table where mabeuf lay
who is to drink that bossuet asked him
then they barricaded the window below and held in readiness the iron
cross bars which served to secure the door of the wine shop at night
the fortress was complete the barricade was the rampart the wine shop
was the dungeon with the stones which remained they stopped up the
as the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of
their ammunition and as the assailants know this the assailants
combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure expose
themselves to fire prematurely though in appearance more than in
reality and take their ease the preparations for attack are always
made with a certain methodical deliberation after which the lightning
this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and
to perfect everything he felt that since such men were to die their
he said to marius we are the two leaders i will give the last orders
marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade
enjolras had the door of the kitchen which was the ambulance as the
he issued his final orders in the tap room in a curt but profoundly
tranquil tone feuilly listened and replied in the name of all
on the first floor hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase
that is good there are now twenty six combatants of us on foot how
eight too many keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at
hand swords and pistols in your belts twenty men to the barricade six
ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to
fire on the assailants through the loop holes in the stones let not a
single worker remain inactive here presently when the drum beats the
assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade the first to
these arrangements made he turned to javert and said
and laying a pistol on the table he added
the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy
no let us not mix their corpses with our own the little barricade of
the mondetour lane can be scaled it is only four feet high the man is
well pinioned he shall be taken thither and put to death
there was some one who was more impassive at that moment than enjolras
it was javert here jean valjean made his appearance
he had been lost among the group of insurgents he stepped forth and
in the name of the republic the barricade has two saviors marius
do you think that i deserve a recompense
that i may blow that mans brains out
javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible
as for enjolras he had begun to re load his rifle he cut his eyes
jean valjean did in fact take possession of javert by seating
himself on the end of the table he seized the pistol and a faint click
almost at the same moment a blast of trumpets became audible
take care shouted marius from the top of the barricade
javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to
him and gazing intently at the insurgents he said to them
you are in no better case than i am
the insurgents poured out tumultuously and as they went received in
the back may we be permitted the expression this sally of javerts
when jean valjean was left alone with javert he untied the rope which
fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body and the knot of
which was under the table after this he made him a sign to rise
javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of
jean valjean took javert by the martingale as one would take a beast of
burden by the breast band and dragging the latter after him emerged
from the wine shop slowly because javert with his impeded limbs could
jean valjean had the pistol in his hand
in this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade the
insurgents all intent on the attack which was imminent had their
marius alone stationed on one side at the extreme left of the
barricade saw them pass this group of victim and executioner was
illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul
jean valjean with some difficulty but without relaxing his hold for
a single instant made javert pinioned as he was scale the little
when they had crossed this barrier they found themselves alone in the
lane no one saw them among the heap they could distinguish a livid
face streaming hair a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a
woman it was eponine the corner of the houses hid them from the
insurgents the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a
javert gazed askance at this body and profoundly calm said in a low
it strikes me that i know that girl
jean valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on javert a look
which it required no words to interpret javert it is i
jean valjean drew from his pocket a knife and opened it
a clasp knife exclaimed javert you are right that suits you
jean valjean cut the martingale which javert had about his neck then he
cut the cords on his wrists then stooping down he cut the cord on his
feet and straightening himself up he said to him
javert was not easily astonished still master of himself though
he was he could not repress a start he remained open mouthed and
i do not think that i shall escape from this place but if by chance
i do i live under the name of fauchelevent in the rue de lhomme
javert snarled like a tiger which made him half open one corner of his
javert repeated in a low voice number 7
he buttoned up his coat once more resumed the military stiffness
between his shoulders made a half turn folded his arms and supporting
his chin on one of his hands he set out in the direction of the halles
a few minutes later javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean
javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed jean valjean
