time he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this
agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me
i thank your serene highness but i fear i am no longer fit for the
staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed
but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regiment
am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should be
sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you
a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutuzovs podgy
i am sorry for i need you but youre right youre right its not
here that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are
not the regiments would not be what they are if the would be advisers
served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember
yes i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and a flush of
pleasure suffused prince andrews face at this recollection
taking his hand and drawing him downwards kutuzov offered his cheek to
be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old mans eyes
though prince andrew knew that kutuzovs tears came easily and that he
was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show
sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both
go your way and god be with you i know your path is the path of
honor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to
send and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak of the turkish
war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much
blamed he said both for that war and the peace but everything
came at the right time tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre 
and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning
to the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah those
advisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not have
made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war
everything in haste but more haste less speed kamenski would have
been lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
men it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
win a campaign for that not storming and attacking but patience and
time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed
these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made them
turks eat horseflesh he swayed his head and the french shall too
believe me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest ill
make them eat horseflesh and tears again dimmed his eyes
 everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait
but shant we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew
we shall if everybody wants it it cant be helped but believe me
my dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience and
time they will do it all but the advisers nentendent pas de cette
oreille voila le mal  some want a thing others dont whats one to
do he asked evidently expecting an answer well what do you want us
to do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look ill
tell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did not
reply i will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute mon
cher he paused abstiens toi 2 he articulated the french proverb
 dont see it that way thats the trouble
 2 when in doubt my dear fellow do nothing
well good by my dear fellow remember that with all my heart i share
your sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a prince
nor a commander in chief but a father if you want anything come
straight to me good bye my dear boy
again he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter had
left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
unfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was but after that
interview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the
general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
that old man in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions
and in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusions
only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events the more
reassured he was that everything would be as it should he will not
bring in any plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anything
thought prince andrew but he will hear everything remember
everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anything
useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is
something stronger and more important than his own will the inevitable
course of events and he can see them and grasp their significance and
seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his
personal wish directed to something else and above all thought prince
andrew one believes in him because hes russian despite the novel by
genlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when he
said what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said
on such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity and
general approval were founded with which despite court influences the
popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received
after the emperor had left moscow life flowed on there in its usual
course and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believe
that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english
club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for
it the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
displayed during the emperors stay was the call for contributions of
men and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
assumed a legal official form and became unavoidable
with the enemys approach to moscow the moscovites view of their
situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more
frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger
approaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices that
speak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a
man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it
the other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing and
painful to think of the danger since it is not in mans power to
foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it is
therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and to
think about what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to the
first voice but in society to the second so it was now with the
inhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay in
rostopchins broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potman
and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin who having been a
militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub heard that
napoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the french in very
bad language came out of the drink shop and under the sign of the
eagle began to address the assembled people were read and discussed
together with the latest of vasili lvovich pushkins bouts rimes
in the corner room at the club members gathered to read these
broadsheets and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french
saying they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with our
buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all
dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork
others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it was
said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners
from moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon
among them but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchins witty
remark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat
and rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez en vousmemes entrez
dans la barque et nen faites pas une barque de charon  there was
talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
moscow and to this shinshins witticism was added that for that alone
moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that mamonovs
regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and that bezukhov
had spent even more on his but that the best thing about bezukhovs
action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the
head of his regiment without charging anything for the show
 think it over get into the barque and take care not to make it a
you dont spare anyone said julie drubetskaya as she collected and
pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin beringed
julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell
bezukhov est ridicule but he is so kind and good natured what
a forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called mon
chevalier and who was going with her to nizhni
in julies set as in many other circles in moscow it had been agreed
that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip
and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary
another forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who was
present what pleasure is there to be is not russian
you spare no one continued julie to the young man without heeding the
for caustique i am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay again
for the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i wont be
responsible she remarked turning to the author i have neither the
money nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a master to teach me
ah here he is she added quand on no no she said to the
militia officer you wont catch me speak of the sun and you see its
rays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of you
she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman we were
saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonovs
oh dont talk to me of my regiment replied pierre kissing his
hostess hand and taking a seat beside her i am so sick of it
you will of course command it yourself said julie directing a sly
the latter in pierres presence had ceased to be caustic and his face
expressed perplexity as to what julies smile might mean in spite of
his absent mindedness and good nature pierres personality immediately
checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face
no said pierre with a laughing glance at his big stout body i
should make too good a target for the french besides i am afraid i
should hardly be able to climb onto a horse
among those whom julies guests happened to choose to gossip about were
i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie and he
is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to
buy his house and his estate near moscow but it drags on and on he
no i think the sale will come off in a few days said someone
though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now
why asked julie you dont think moscow is in danger
i what a question i am going because well because everyone is
going and besides i am not joan of arc or an amazon
well of course of course let me have some more strips of linen
if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his
debts said the militia officer speaking of rostov
a kindly old man but not up to much and why do they stay on so long in
moscow they meant to leave for the country long ago natalie is quite
well again now isnt she julie asked pierre with a knowing smile
they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined
obolenskis cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is
being formed but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and
are expecting him every day the count wanted to leave long ago but the
countess wont on any account leave moscow till her son returns
i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs natalie has
recovered her looks and is brighter she sang a song how easily some
you know count such knights as you are only found in madame de
what knights what do you mean demanded pierre blushing
oh come my dear count cest la fable de tout moscou je vous admire
 it is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you
what is the talk of all moscow pierre asked angrily rising to his
i dont know anything about it said pierre
i know you were friendly with natalie and so but i was always more
no madame pierre continued in a tone of displeasure i have not
taken on myself the role of natalie rostovas knight at all and have
not been to their house for nearly a month but i cannot understand the
qui sexcuse saccuse  said julie smiling and waving the lint
triumphantly and to have the last word she promptly changed the
subject do you know what i heard today poor mary bolkonskaya arrived
in moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her father
really where is she i should like very much to see her said pierre
i spent the evening with her yesterday she is going to their estate
near moscow either today or tomorrow morning with her nephew
she is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is quite a
romance nicholas rostov she was surrounded and they wanted to kill
her and had wounded some of her people he rushed in and saved her
another romance said the militia officer really this general
flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off catiche
do you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
 a little bit in love with the young man
but how could one say that in russian
when pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchins broadsheets
the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden
people to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad that
ladies and tradesmens wives were leaving the city there will be less
panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will stake my life on
it that scoundrel will not enter moscow these words showed pierre
clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow the
second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma that
count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the
inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at
the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a low
price the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former
chigirin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the
terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul
but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near
shall i join the army and enter the service or wait he asked himself
for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table
and began to lay them out for a game of patience
if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the
cards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes out
he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the
eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in
then it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himself
come in come in he added to the princess
only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waist
was still living in pierres house the two younger ones had both
excuse my coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and
agitated voice you know some decision must be come to what is going
to happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is
on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in
the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling
satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me today
how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them
credit and the people too are quite mutinous they no longer obey even
my maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon begin
beating us one cant walk in the streets but above all the french
will be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just one
thing of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken to
petersburg whatever i may be i cant live under bonapartes rule
oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the
i wont submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you
but i will ill give the order at once
the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with
muttering to herself she sat down on a chair
but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in
the city and there is not the slightest danger see ive just been
reading he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes that
he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow
oh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is a
hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didnt he
write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be
should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly and honor
and glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajolery
has brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her
oh but its so you take everything so to heart said pierre and
although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but
remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation
irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting
next day toward evening the princess set off and pierres head steward
came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his
regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates in
general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising
a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able to
well then sell it said he whats to be done i cant draw back
the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was
pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he
expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was left in town julie
had gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only the
rostovs remained but he did not go to see them
to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo
to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe
and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet
ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperors
desire the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows
as soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and
intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let
him know i have informed him of the matter
please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the
first time that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemys
hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
on his way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe place
pierre seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and got out
of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged the
flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the
flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a
green jacket who was moaning piteously another criminal thin and
pale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with
a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchmans
face pierre pushed his way in through the crowd
what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking
but the attention of the crowd officials burghers shopkeepers
peasants and women in cloaks and in pelisses was so eagerly centered
on what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stout
man rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to
appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but
suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way full blooded
grown up men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd
people began talking loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as it
eh mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his
teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre
the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be
appreciated some people began to laugh others continued to watch in
dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man
pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back
to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his
seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so
where are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to
to the governors as you ordered answered the coachman
fool idiot shouted pierre abusing his coachman a thing he rarely
did home i told you and drive faster blockhead i must get away
at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
lobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no
longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that
it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the
man ought to have known it for himself
on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey his head coachman who
knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscow that he
would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that his saddle
horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so
on evstafeys representation pierre had to put off his departure till
next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance
on the twenty fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain and
after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night in
perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that
evening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in
perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer
his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching
every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel
where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the
march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon
were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the
farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of
troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to
what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the emperors visit a
sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing
something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that
constitutes mens happiness the comforts of life wealth even life
itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with
something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to
determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in
sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to
sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and
on the twenty fourth of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was
fought on the twenty fifth not a shot was fired by either side and on
the twenty sixth the battle of borodino itself took place
why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and
accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least
sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result
for the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer
to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the
world and for the french its immediate result was that they were
brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared
more than anything in the world what the result must be was quite
obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle
if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must
have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he
was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally
clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutuzov this was
mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one
man less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore
should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have
fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged
thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am
before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french
was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than
one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the
battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gave
it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
communication still more if it is said that he expected to end the
campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleons
historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to
stop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the
occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had
seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him and
had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily
and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historians
provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the
generals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved
the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish
the whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom
ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are
on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding
battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and well
known but quite false conception all the historians describe the
the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out for
itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the left
of the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle to
it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle was
in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on
the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the twenty fourth we are
told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on the
twenty sixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position on
so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to
look into the matter can easily convince himself
the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary
during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did
not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to
occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand
for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because
miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other
reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger
and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought
far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one
might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at
not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of
borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that is
the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty
fifth of august 1812 did they think that a battle might be fought
there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments
there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty fifth and
twenty sixth were not completed and secondly by the position of the
shevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the
position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly
fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and
six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the
twenty fourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the
enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was
fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an
advanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the twenty
fifth barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino
redoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutuzov himself in
his report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of the
shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later
when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that the
incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify
the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as
infallible that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post whereas in
reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the
battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously
selected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was
the case was evidently this a position was selected along the river
kolocha which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute
angle so that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank near
the village of novoe and the center at borodino at the confluence of
to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the
battle was actually fought this position protected by the river
kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow
napoleon riding to valuevo on the twenty fourth did not see as the
history books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa to
borodino he could not have seen that position because it did not
exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while
pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
russian position at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for the
russians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians not having
time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other
side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the
whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian
side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semenovsk and
borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other
plain in russia and there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of
had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty fourth to the
kolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that
the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position and the
battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case we
should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt our left flank
still more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center
or on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the
twenty fifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as the
attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
our rear guard that is immediately after the fight at gridneva and
as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a
general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth the first
and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the
twenty fourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
after the loss of the shevardino redoubt we found ourselves on the
morning of the twenty fifth without a position for our left flank and
were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
not only was the russian army on the twenty sixth defended by weak
unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was
increased by the fact that the russian commanders not having fully
realized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the left
flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
right to left maintained their extended position from the village of
novoe to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to
left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle
the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left
flank with but half as many men poniatowskis action against utitsa
and uvarovs on the right flank against the french were actions
distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino
did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders
mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian
army and people it has been described the battle of borodino was not
fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
weaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of the
shevardino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodino on an
open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous
as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not
merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
on the morning of the twenty fifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk at the
descent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the
town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and
the bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
foot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
its singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers
shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the
carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or
sitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
incline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged with
rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on to
the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almost
all of them stared with naive childlike curiosity at pierres white hat
pierres coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill
with its singers surrounded pierres carriage and blocked the road
pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which
the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above pierres head was
the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the
carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the
driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one
of its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the breech band on his
one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following
the cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to
i say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on to
pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was
looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded
now at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were
sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had
probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags
and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babys head his nose and
mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the
cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a fair haired
recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face looked
at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his
face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by
ah lost quite lost is my head so keen living in a foreign land
as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the
metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near the
panting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sad
the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
its not the soldiers only but ive seen peasants today too the
peasants even they have to go said the soldier behind the cart
addressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadays
they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word its moscow they
in spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood what
the road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on
he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but only
saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different
branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his white
having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
eagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors he was
driving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeon
and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the drivers
count your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor
yes yes there will be something to see
pierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention of
the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov
why should you be god knows where out of sight during the battle he
said exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his serene
highness knows you and will receive you graciously thats what you must
the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry
you think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is
the position repeated the doctor well thats not my line drive
past tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillock
can one see from there if you would
but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig
i would go with you but on my honor im up to here and he pointed to
his throat im galloping to the commander of the corps how do matters
stand you know count therell be a battle tomorrow out of an army
of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded
and we havent stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough for
six thousand we have ten thousand carts but we need other things as
well we must manage as best we can
the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who had
stared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he had
noticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
they may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but death
and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill
the carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of the
sun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind
the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment
think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from
among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at my
hat strange thought pierre continuing his way to tatarinova
in front of a landowners house to the left of the road stood carriages
wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commander in chief
was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and
hardly any of the staff were there they had gone to the church service
when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street he
saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with
crosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated and
perspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
some of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
along planks while others stood about doing nothing
two officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeing
these peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their
position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded men at
mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said they
want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these bearded
peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots and
perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward the
pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
than anything he had yet seen or heard
pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamen
ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield
it was about eleven oclock the sun shone somewhat to the left and
behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising like
an amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere
from above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolensk
highroad passing through a village with a white church some five
hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodino
below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and winding
down and up rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible
about four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond valuevo
the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in the
distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the
cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun here and
there over the whole of that blue expanse to right and left of the
forest and the road smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite
masses of troops ours and the enemys the ground to the right along
the course of the kolocha and moskva rivers was broken and hilly
between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the
distance on the left the ground was more level there were fields of
grain and the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned down
all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could
he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only fields
meadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages mounds and
streams and try as he would he could descry no military position in
this place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish our
i must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who
was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure
may i ask you said pierre what village that is in front
burdino isnt it said the officer turning to his companion
the officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up to
yes and there further on are the french said the officer there
one can see them with the naked eye why there
the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
beyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierre
had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face
ah those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll
on the left near which some troops could be seen
ah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in the
distance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in a hollow
where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible
thats his again said the officer it was the shevardino redoubt
it was ours yesterday but now it is his
our position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i can
tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our
entrenchments there you see theres our center at borodino just
there and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
church thats where one crosses the kolocha you see down there where
the rows of hay are lying in the hollow theres the bridge thats our
center our right flank is over there he pointed sharply to the right
far away in the broken ground thats where the moskva river is and we
have thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the left
flank here the officer paused well you see thats difficult to
explain yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino you see
where the oak is but now we have withdrawn our left wing now it is
over there do you see that village and the smoke thats semenovsk
yes there he pointed to raevskis knoll but the battle will hardly
be there his having moved his troops there is only a ruse he will
probably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may be
many a man will be missing tomorrow he remarked
an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving
these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but
at this point evidently not liking the officers remark interrupted
gabions must be sent for said he sternly
