cosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the
grass drenched in dew and saying to herself through the species of
melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged really one needs
wooden shoes for the garden at this hour one takes cold
as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot
which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not
cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant all at once
the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by
itself that some one had placed it there that an arm had been thrust
through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her this time the
fear was genuine the stone was there no doubt was possible she did
not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the
house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the door like
window opening on the flight of steps she inquired of toussaint
we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered
may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future the musical
notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us
jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often
toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade
the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening
and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them
toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the
fact but she could not refrain from adding
so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true we might be
assassinated before we had time to say ouf and monsieur does not sleep
in the house to boot but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up
like prisons lone women that is enough to make one shudder i believe
you just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at
night and say hold your tongue and begin to cut your throat its
not the dying so much you die for one must die and thats all right
its the abomination of feeling those people touch you and then their
knives they cant be able to cut well with them ah good gracious
cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and
possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week
which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at
the stone which has been placed on the bench for fear of opening the
garden gate and allowing the men to enter she saw that all the doors
and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint go all over the
house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber
bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly
all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full
at sunrise the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all
our terrors of the past night and our laughter is in direct proportion
to our terror which they have caused at sunrise cosette when she
woke viewed her fright as a nightmare and said to herself what have
i been thinking of it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a
week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the
chimney pot am i becoming a coward the sun which was glowing through
the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson
reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her
there was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round
hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest
she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and
broke out in a cold perspiration the stone was there
but this lasted only for a moment that which is terror by night is
bah said she come let us see what it is
she lifted the stone which was tolerably large beneath it was
something which resembled a letter it was a white envelope cosette
seized it there was no address on one side no seal on the other
yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty papers could be seen
cosette examined it it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity
cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper
each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and
cosette looked for a name there was none to whom was this addressed
to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench
from whom did it come an irresistible fascination took possession
of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were
trembling in her hand she gazed at the sky the street the acacias
all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof
and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to
herself that she must know what it contained
illustration cosette with letter 4b4 5 cosette after letter
the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a
single being even to god that is love
love is the salutation of the angels to the stars
how sad is the soul when it is sad through love
what a void in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the
world oh how true it is that the beloved being becomes god one could
comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not god the father of
all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love
the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain
is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams
god is behind everything but everything hides god things are
black creatures are opaque to love a being is to render that being
certain thoughts are prayers there are moments when whatever the
attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees
parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which
possess however a reality of their own they are prevented from seeing
each other they cannot write to each other they discover a multitude
of mysterious means to correspond they send each other the song of the
birds the perfume of the flowers the smiles of children the light of
the sun the sighings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation
and why not all the works of god are made to serve love love is
sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages
oh spring thou art a letter that i write to her
the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds love that
is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity in the infinite
love participates of the soul itself it is of the same nature like
it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible
imperishable it is a point of fire that exists within us which is
immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can
extinguish we feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and
we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven
oh love adorations voluptuousness of two minds which understand each
other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances
which penetrate each other you will come to me will you not bliss
strolls by twos in the solitudes blessed and radiant days i have
sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from
the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of
god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give
them endless duration after a life of love an eternity of love is in
fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable
felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is
impossible even to god god is the plenitude of heaven love is the
you look at a star for two reasons because it is luminous and because
it is impenetrable you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater
all of us whoever we may be have our respirable beings we lack
air and we stifle then we die to die for lack of love is horrible
when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic
unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are
concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of
the same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the
on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she
walks you are lost you love but one thing remains for you to do to
think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you
what love commences can be finished by god alone
true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a
handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its
hopes it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely
if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive
plant if you are a man be love
nothing suffices for love we have happiness we desire paradise we
oh ye who love each other all this is contained in love understand
how to find it there love has contemplation as well as heaven and more
does she still come to the luxembourg no sir this is the church
where she attends mass is it not she no longer comes here does
she still live in this house she has moved away where has she gone
what a melancholy thing not to know the address of ones soul
love has its childishness other passions have their pettinesses shame
on the passions which belittle man honor to the one which makes a child
there is one strange thing do you know it i dwell in the night there
is a being who carried off my sky when she went away
oh would that we were lying side by side in the same grave hand
in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a
ye who suffer because ye love love yet more to die of love is to live
love a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture
oh joy of the birds it is because they have nests that they sing
love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise
deep hearts sage minds take life as god has made it it is a long
trial an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny this
destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the
tomb then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the
definitive the definitive meditate upon that word the living perceive
the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead
in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate woe alas to
him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances death will
deprive him of all try to love souls you will find them again
i encountered in the street a very poor young man who was in love his
hat was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holes water trickled
through his shoes and the stars through his soul
what a grand thing it is to be loved what a far grander thing it is
to love the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion it is no longer
composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything
that is not elevated and great an unworthy thought can no more
germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier the serene and lofty soul
inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds
and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its
vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels
anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests
if there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct
as cosette read she gradually fell into thought at the very moment
when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note book the
handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate it was his
she resumed her contemplation of the book it was written in the most
charming of chirography thought cosette in the same hand but with
divers inks sometimes very black again whitish as when ink has been
added to the inkstand and consequently on different days it was
then a mind which had unfolded itself there sigh by sigh irregularly
without order without choice without object hap hazard cosette
had never read anything like it this manuscript in which she already
perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the effect of a
half open sanctuary each one of these mysterious lines shone before
her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance the education
which she had received had always talked to her of the soul and never
of love very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the
flame this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed
to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning
the end it was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her
a handful of rays of light in these few lines she felt a passionate
ardent generous honest nature a sacred will an immense sorrow and
an immense despair a suffering heart an ecstasy fully expanded what
was this manuscript a letter a letter without name without address
without date without signature pressing and disinterested an enigma
composed of truths a message of love made to be brought by an angel and
read by a virgin an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth the
love letter of a phantom to a shade it was an absent one tranquil and
dejected who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the
absent love his lady the secret of fate the key of life love this
had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven
these lines which had fallen one by one on the paper were what might
now from whom could these pages come who could have penned them
cosette did not hesitate a moment one man only
day had dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared she felt an
unheard of joy and a profound anguish it was he he who had written
he was there it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing
while she was forgetful of him he had found her again but had she
forgotten him no never she was foolish to have thought so for a
single moment she had always loved him always adored him the fire had
been smothered and had smouldered for a time but she saw all plainly
now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth afresh and
had inflamed her whole being this note book was like a spark which
had fallen from that other soul into hers she felt the conflagration
she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh
yes said she how perfectly i recognize all that that is what i had
already read in his eyes as she was finishing it for the third time
lieutenant theodule passed the gate once more and rattled his spurs
upon the pavement cosette was forced to raise her eyes she thought him
insipid silly stupid useless foppish displeasing impertinent and
extremely ugly the officer thought it his duty to smile at her
she turned away as in shame and indignation she would gladly have
she fled re entered the house and shut herself up in her chamber to
peruse the manuscript once more to learn it by heart and to dream
when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her
all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love the
all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment she scarcely
thought her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain
she could not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor
what vague things she dared make herself no promises and she did
not wish to refuse herself anything flashes of pallor passed over her
countenance and shivers ran through her frame it seemed to her at
intervals that she was entering the land of chimaeras she said to
herself is this reality then she felt of the dear paper within her
bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt its angles
against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he
would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy
which overflowed from beneath her eyelids oh yes she thought it
is certainly he this comes from him and is for me
and she told herself that an intervention of the angels a celestial
oh transfiguration of love oh dreams that celestial chance that
intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to
another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the lions ditch over
chapter vi old people are made to go out opportunely
when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself she
arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on a dress
whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much and which
through this slope permitted a view of the beginning of her throat and
was as young girls say a trifle indecent it was not in the least
indecent but it was prettier than usual she made her toilet thus
at dusk she went down to the garden toussaint was busy in her kitchen
she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches
from time to time with her hand because there were some which hung very
she sat down and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she
all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one
undergoes when there is some one standing behind one even when she does
she turned her head and rose to her feet
his head was bare he appeared to have grown thin and pale his black
clothes were hardly discernible the twilight threw a wan light on
his fine brow and covered his eyes in shadows beneath a veil of
incomparable sweetness he had something about him that suggested death
and night his face was illuminated by the light of the dying day and
by the thought of a soul that is taking flight
he seemed to be not yet a ghost and he was no longer a man
he had flung away his hat in the thicket a few paces distant
cosette though ready to swoon uttered no cry she retreated slowly
for she felt herself attracted he did not stir by virtue of something
ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him she felt the look in his
cosette in her retreat encountered a tree and leaned against it had
it not been for this tree she would have fallen
then she heard his voice that voice which she had really never heard
barely rising above the rustle of the leaves and murmuring
pardon me here i am my heart is full i could not live on as i was
living and i have come have you read what i placed there on the bench
do you recognize me at all have no fear of me it is a long time you
remember the day since you looked at me at the luxembourg near the
gladiator and the day when you passed before me it was on the 16th of
june and the 2d of july it is nearly a year ago i have not seen you
for a long time i inquired of the woman who let the chairs and she
told me that she no longer saw you you lived in the rue de louest on
the third floor in the front apartments of a new house you see that
i know i followed you what else was there for me to do and then you
disappeared i thought i saw you pass once while i was reading the
newspapers under the arcade of the odeon i ran after you but no it
was a person who had a bonnet like yours at night i came hither do
not be afraid no one sees me i come to gaze upon your windows near
at hand i walk very softly so that you may not hear for you might be
alarmed the other evening i was behind you you turned round i fled
once i heard you singing i was happy did it affect you because i
heard you singing through the shutters that could not hurt you no
it is not so you see you are my angel let me come sometimes i think
that i am going to die if you only knew i adore you forgive me i
speak to you but i do not know what i am saying i may have displeased
and she sank down as though on the point of death
he grasped her she fell he took her in his arms he pressed her close
without knowing what he was doing he supported her though he was
tottering himself it was as though his brain were full of smoke
lightnings darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him
that he was accomplishing some religious act and that he was committing
a profanation moreover he had not the least passion for this lovely
woman whose force he felt against his breast he was beside himself with
she took his hand and laid it on her heart he felt the paper there he
she replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a
and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and
he fell upon the bench and she beside him they had no words more the
stars were beginning to gleam how did it come to pass that their lips
met how comes it to pass that the birds sing that snow melts that
the rose unfolds that may expands that the dawn grows white behind the
black trees on the shivering crest of the hills
both started and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes
they felt neither the cool night nor the cold stone nor the damp
earth nor the wet grass they looked at each other and their hearts
were full of thoughts they had clasped hands unconsciously
she did not ask him she did not even wonder how he had entered there
and how he had made his way into the garden it seemed so simple to her
from time to time marius knee touched cosettes knee and both
at intervals cosette stammered a word her soul fluttered on her lips
like a drop of dew on a flower
little by little they began to talk to each other effusion followed
silence which is fulness the night was serene and splendid overhead
these two beings pure as spirits told each other everything their
dreams their intoxications their ecstasies their chimaeras their
weaknesses how they had adored each other from afar how they had
longed for each other their despair when they had ceased to see each
other they confided to each other in an ideal intimacy which nothing
could augment their most secret and most mysterious thoughts they
related to each other with candid faith in their illusions all that
love youth and the remains of childhood which still lingered about
them suggested to their minds their two hearts poured themselves out
into each other in such wise that at the expiration of a quarter of an
hour it was the young man who had the young girls soul and the young
girl who had the young mans soul each became permeated with the other
they were enchanted with each other they dazzled each other
when they had finished when they had told each other everything she
laid her head on his shoulder and asked him
my name is marius said he and yours
chapter i the malicious playfulness of the wind
since 1823 when the tavern of montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck
and was being gradually engulfed not in the abyss of a bankruptcy but
in the cesspool of petty debts the thenardier pair had had two other
children both males that made five two girls and three boys
madame thenardier had got rid of the last two while they were still
got rid of is the word there was but a mere fragment of nature in that
woman a phenomenon by the way of which there is more than one example
extant like the marechale de la mothe houdancourt the thenardier was
a mother to her daughters only there her maternity ended her hatred of
the human race began with her own sons in the direction of her sons her
evil disposition was uncompromising and her heart had a lugubrious wall
in that quarter as the reader has seen she detested the eldest she
cursed the other two why because the most terrible of motives the
most unanswerable of retorts because i have no need of a litter of
let us explain how the thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their
last two children and even in drawing profit from the operation
the woman magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the
same one who had succeeded in making old gillenormand support the two
children which she had had she lived on the quai des celestins at the
corner of this ancient street of the petit musc which afforded her the
opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor the reader will
remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts
of the seine in paris thirty five years ago and of which science took
advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of
inhalations of alum so beneficially replaced at the present day by the
external tincture of iodine during this epidemic the magnon lost both
her boys who were still very young one in the morning the other
in the evening of the same day this was a blow these children were
precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month these
eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of m gillenormand by
collector of his rents m barge a retired tip staff in the rue du
roi de sicile the children dead the income was at an end the magnon
sought an expedient in that dark free masonry of evil of which she
formed a part everything is known all secrets are kept and all lend
mutual aid magnon needed two children the thenardiers had two
the same sex the same age a good arrangement for the one a good
investment for the other the little thenardiers became little magnons
magnon quitted the quai des celestins and went to live in the rue
clocheperce in paris the identity which binds an individual to himself
the registry office being in no way warned raised no objections and
the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world
only the thenardier exacted for this loan of her children ten francs a
month which magnon promised to pay and which she actually did pay
it is unnecessary to add that m gillenormand continued to perform
his compact he came to see the children every six months he did not
perceive the change monsieur magnon said to him how much they
thenardier to whom avatars were easy seized this occasion to become
jondrette his two daughters and gavroche had hardly had time to
discover that they had two little brothers when a certain degree
of misery is reached one is overpowered with a sort of spectral
indifference and one regards human beings as though they were spectres
your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy
forms barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily
on the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little
ones to magnon with express intention of renouncing them forever the
thenardier had felt or had appeared to feel a scruple she said to her
husband but this is abandoning our children thenardier masterful
and phlegmatic cauterized the scruple with this saying jean jacques
rousseau did even better from scruples the mother proceeded to
uneasiness but what if the police were to annoy us tell me monsieur
thenardier is what we have done permissible thenardier replied
everything is permissible no one will see anything but true blue in
it besides no one has any interest in looking closely after children
magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime she was
careful about her toilet she shared her lodgings which were furnished
in an affected and wretched style with a clever gallicized english
thief this english woman who had become a naturalized parisienne
recommended by very wealthy relations intimately connected with the
medals in the library and mademoiselle mars diamonds became celebrated
later on in judicial accounts she was called mamselle miss
the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to
complain of their lot recommended by the eighty francs they were well
cared for as is everything from which profit is derived they were
neither badly clothed nor badly fed they were treated almost like
little gentlemen better by their false mother than by their real
one magnon played the lady and talked no thieves slang in their
thus passed several years thenardier augured well from the fact one
day he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend
of ten francs the father must give them some education
all at once these two poor children who had up to that time been
protected tolerably well even by their evil fate were abruptly hurled
into life and forced to begin it for themselves
a wholesale arrest of malefactors like that in the jondrette garret
is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter society
which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure of this
description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world the
one day a short time after magnon had handed to eponine the note
relating to the rue plumet a sudden raid was made by the police in the
rue clocheperce magnon was seized as was also mamselle miss and all
the inhabitants of the house which was of a suspicious character were
gathered into the net while this was going on the two little boys were
playing in the back yard and saw nothing of the raid when they tried
to enter the house again they found the door fastened and the house
empty a cobbler opposite called them to him and delivered to them a
paper which their mother had left for them on this paper there was an
address m barge collector of rents rue du roi de sicile no 8 the
proprietor of the stall said to them you cannot live here any longer
go there it is near by the first street on the left ask your way from
the children set out the elder leading the younger and holding in his
hand the paper which was to guide them it was cold and his benumbed
little fingers could not close very firmly and they did not keep a very
good hold on the paper at the corner of the rue clocheperce a gust of
wind tore it from him and as night was falling the child was not able
they began to wander aimlessly through the streets
chapter ii in which little gavroche extracts profit from napoleon the
spring in paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which
do not precisely chill but freeze one these north winds which sadden
the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of
cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting
door or window it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had
remained ajar and as though the wind were pouring through it in the
spring of 1832 the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century
broke out in europe these north gales were more harsh and piercing
than ever it was a door even more glacial than that of winter which
was ajar it was the door of the sepulchre in these winds one felt the
from a meteorological point of view these cold winds possessed this
peculiarity that they did not preclude a strong electric tension
frequent storms accompanied by thunder and lightning burst forth at
one evening when these gales were blowing rudely to such a degree that
january seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their
cloaks little gavroche who was always shivering gayly under his rags
was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig makers shop in the
vicinity of the orme saint gervais he was adorned with a womans
woollen shawl picked up no one knows where and which he had converted
into a neck comforter little gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent
admiration of a wax bride in a low necked dress and crowned with
orange flowers who was revolving in the window and displaying her
smile to passers by between two argand lamps but in reality he was
taking an observation of the shop in order to discover whether he
could not prig from the shop front a cake of soap which he would then
proceed to sell for a sou to a hair dresser in the suburbs he had
often managed to breakfast off of such a roll he called his species of
work for which he possessed special aptitude shaving barbers
while contemplating the bride and eyeing the cake of soap he muttered
between his teeth tuesday it was not tuesday was it tuesday perhaps
no one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred
yes perchance this monologue had some connection with the last
occasion on which he had dined three days before for it was now
the barber in his shop which was warmed by a good stove was shaving
a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy that
freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his
while gavroche was scrutinizing the shop window and the cakes of windsor
soap two children of unequal stature very neatly dressed and still
smaller than himself one apparently about seven years of age the other
five timidly turned the handle and entered the shop with a request for
something or other alms possibly in a plaintive murmur which resembled
a groan rather than a prayer they both spoke at once and their words
were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger and the
teeth of the elder were chattering with cold the barber wheeled round
with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust back the
elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed
his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for
the two children resumed their march in tears in the meantime a cloud
little gavroche ran after them and accosted them
we dont know where we are to sleep replied the elder
is that all said gavroche a great matter truly the idea of
and adopting in addition to his superiority which was rather
bantering an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage
and the two children followed him as they would have followed an
gavroche led them up the rue saint antoine in the direction of the
as gavroche walked along he cast an indignant backward glance at the
that fellow has no heart the whiting35 he muttered hes an
a woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file with
gavroche at their head burst into noisy laughter this laugh was
good day mamselle omnibus said gavroche to her
an instant later the wig maker occurred to his mind once more and he
i am making a mistake in the beast hes not a whiting hes a serpent
barber ill go and fetch a locksmith and ill have a bell hung to your
this wig maker had rendered him aggressive as he strode over a gutter
he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet faust on the
brocken and who had a broom in her hand
madam said he so you are going out with your horse
and thereupon he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian
the office is closed said gavroche i do not receive any more
in the meanwhile as he went on up the street he perceived a
beggar girl thirteen or fourteen years old and clad in so short a
gown that her knees were visible lying thoroughly chilled under a
porte cochere the little girl was getting to be too old for such a
thing growth does play these tricks the petticoat becomes short at the
poor girl said gavroche she hasnt even trousers hold on take
and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck
he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar girl where
the child stared at him in astonishment and received the shawl in
silence when a certain stage of distress has been reached in his
misery the poor man no longer groans over evil no longer returns
that done brrr said gavroche who was shivering more than saint
martin for the latter retained one half of his cloak
at this brrr the downpour of rain redoubled in its spite became
ah come now exclaimed gavroche whats the meaning of this its
re raining good heavens if it goes on like this i shall stop my
and he set out on the march once more
its all right he resumed casting a glance at the beggar girl as
she coiled up under the shawl shes got a famous peel
and looking up at the clouds he exclaimed
the two children followed close on his heels
as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices which indicate
a bakers shop for bread is put behind bars like gold gavroche turned
ah by the way brats have we dined
monsieur replied the elder we have had nothing to eat since this
so you have neither father nor mother resumed gavroche majestically
excuse us sir we have a papa and a mamma but we dont know where
sometimes thats better than knowing where they are said gavroche
we have been wandering about these two hours continued the elder we
have hunted for things at the corners of the streets but we have found
i know ejaculated gavroche its the dogs who eat everything
ah we have lost our authors we dont know what we have done with
them this should not be gamins its stupid to let old people stray
off like that come now we must have a snooze all the same
however he asked them no questions what was more simple than that they
