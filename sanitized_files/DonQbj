pleasure not because of any desert of my own i went to govern your
island of barataria which i entered naked and naked i find myself i
neither lose nor gain whether i have governed well or ill i have had
witnesses who will say what they think fit i have answered questions i
have decided causes and always dying of hunger for doctor pedro recio
of tirteafuera the island and governor doctor would have it so enemies
attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary but the people of
the island say they came off safe and victorious by the might of my arm
and may god give them as much health as theres truth in what they say
in short during that time i have weighed the cares and responsibilities
governing brings with it and by my reckoning i find my shoulders cant
bear them nor are they a load for my loins or arrows for my quiver and
so before the government threw me over i preferred to throw the
government over and yesterday morning i left the island as i found it
with the same streets houses and roofs it had when i entered it i
asked no loan of anybody nor did i try to fill my pocket and though i
meant to make some useful laws i made hardly any as i was afraid they
would not be kept for in that case it comes to the same thing to make
them or not to make them i quitted the island as i said without any
escort except my ass i fell into a pit i pushed on through it until
this morning by the light of the sun i saw an outlet but not so easy a
one but that had not heaven sent me my master don quixote id have
stayed there till the end of the world so now my lord and lady duke and
duchess here is your governor sancho panza who in the bare ten days he
has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give
anything to be governor not to say of an island but of the whole world
and that point being settled kissing your worships feet and imitating
the game of the boys when they say leap thou and give me one i take
a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master don
quixote for after all though in it i eat my bread in fear and
trembling at any rate i take my fill and for my part so long as im
full its all alike to me whether its with carrots or with partridges
here sancho brought his long speech to an end don quixote having been
the whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities and when
he found him leave off with so few he thanked heaven in his heart the
duke embraced sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up
the government so soon but that he would see that he was provided with
some other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable the
duchess also embraced him and gave orders that he should be taken good
care of as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse
of the prodigious and unparalleled battle that took place between don
quixote of la mancha and the lacquey tosilos in defence of the daughter
the duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been
played upon sancho panza in giving him the government especially as
their majordomo returned the same day and gave them a minute account of
almost every word and deed that sancho uttered or did during the time
and to wind up with eloquently described to them the attack upon the
island and sanchos fright and departure with which they were not a
little amused after this the history goes on to say that the day fixed
for the battle arrived and that the duke after having repeatedly
instructed his lacquey tosilos how to deal with don quixote so as to
vanquish him without killing or wounding him gave orders to have the
heads removed from the lances telling don quixote that christian
charity on which he plumed himself could not suffer the battle to be
fought with so much risk and danger to life and that he must be content
with the offer of a battlefield on his territory though that was against
the decree of the holy council which prohibits all challenges of the
sort and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme limits don
quixote bade his excellence arrange all matters connected with the affair
as he pleased as on his part he would obey him in everything the dread
day then having arrived and the duke having ordered a spacious stand
to be erected facing the court of the castle for the judges of the field
and the appellant duennas mother and daughter vast crowds flocked from
all the villages and hamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel
spectacle of the battle nobody dead or alive in those parts having
ever seen or heard of such a one
the first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the
ceremonies who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there was
nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble or
fall then the duennas entered and seated themselves enveloped in
mantles covering their eyes nay even their bosoms and displaying no
slight emotion as don quixote appeared in the lists shortly afterwards
accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed that
threatened to crush the whole place the great lacquey tosilos made his
appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor down and stiffly
cased in a suit of stout shining armour the horse was a manifest
frieslander broad backed and flea bitten and with half a hundred of
wool hanging to each of his fetlocks the gallant combatant came well
primed by his master the duke as to how he was to bear himself against
the valiant don quixote of la mancha being warned that he must on no
account slay him but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid
the risk of killing him as he was sure to do if he met him full tilt he
crossed the courtyard at a walk and coming to where the duennas were
placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband the marshal
of the field summoned don quixote who had already presented himself in
the courtyard and standing by the side of tosilos he addressed the
duennas and asked them if they consented that don quixote of la mancha
should do battle for their right they said they did and that whatever
he should do in that behalf they declared rightly done final and valid
by this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery
commanding the enclosure which was filled to overflowing with a
multitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled
encounter the conditions of the combat were that if don quixote proved
the victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of dona rodriguez
but if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise
that was claimed against him and from all obligations to give
satisfaction the master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them
and stationed them each on the spot where he was to stand the drums
beat the sound of the trumpets filled the air the earth trembled under
foot the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety some hoping
for a happy issue some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair
and lastly don quixote commending himself with all his heart to god our
lord and to the lady dulcinea del toboso stood waiting for them to give
the necessary signal for the onset our lacquey however was thinking of
something very different he only thought of what i am now going to
it seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the
most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life and the little blind
boy whom in our streets they commonly call love had no mind to let slip
the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart and adding it to the list
of his trophies and so stealing gently upon him unseen he drove a dart
two yards long into the poor lacqueys left side and pierced his heart
through and through which he was able to do quite at his ease for love
is invisible and comes in and goes out as he likes without anyone
calling him to account for what he does well then when they gave the
signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy musing upon the
beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty and so he
paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet unlike don quixote who
was off the instant he heard it and at the highest speed rocinante was
capable of set out to meet his enemy his good squire sancho shouting
lustily as he saw him start god guide thee cream and flower of
knights errant god give thee the victory for thou hast the right on thy
side but though tosilos saw don quixote coming at him he never stirred
a step from the spot where he was posted and instead of doing so called
loudly to the marshal of the field to whom when he came up to see what
he wanted he said senor is not this battle to decide whether i marry
or do not marry that lady just so was the answer well then said
the lacquey i feel qualms of conscience and i should lay a heavy
burden upon it if i were to proceed any further with the combat i
therefore declare that i yield myself vanquished and that i am willing
the marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of
tosilos and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of
the affair he knew not what to say in reply don quixote pulled up in mid
career when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the attack the
duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not go on but the
marshal of the field hastened to him to let him know what tosilos said
and he was amazed and extremely angry at it in the meantime tosilos
advanced to where dona rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice senora i
am willing to marry your daughter and i have no wish to obtain by strife
and fighting what i can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life
the valiant don quixote heard him and said as that is the case i am
released and absolved from my promise let them marry by all means and
as god our lord has given her may saint peter add his blessing
the duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle and going up
to tosilos he said to him is it true sir knight that you yield
yourself vanquished and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to
and he does well said sancho for what thou hast to give to the
mouse give to the cat and it will save thee all trouble
tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet and he begged them to
come to his help at once as his power of breathing was failing him and
he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space they removed
it in all haste and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze
at this sight dona rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry
exclaiming this is a trick this is a trick they have put tosilos my
lord the dukes lacquey upon us in place of the real husband the
justice of god and the king against such trickery not to say roguery
do not distress yourselves ladies said don quixote for this is no
trickery or roguery or if it is it is not the duke who is at the bottom
of it but those wicked enchanters who persecute me and who jealous of
my reaping the glory of this victory have turned your husbands features
into those of this person who you say is a lacquey of the dukes take
my advice and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him for
beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a husband
when the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of
laughter and he said the things that happen to senor don quixote are
so extraordinary that i am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not
one but let us adopt this plan and device let us put off the marriage
for say a fortnight and let us keep this person about whom we are
uncertain in close confinement and perhaps in the course of that time he
may return to his original shape for the spite which the enchanters
entertain against senor don quixote cannot last so long especially as it
is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and
oh senor said sancho those scoundrels are well used to changing
whatever concerns my master from one thing into another a knight that he
overcame some time back called the knight of the mirrors they turned
into the shape of the bachelor samson carrasco of our town and a great
friend of ours and my lady dulcinea del toboso they have turned into a
common country wench so i suspect this lacquey will have to live and die
a lacquey all the days of his life
here the rodriguezs daughter exclaimed let him be who he may this man
that claims me for a wife i am thankful to him for the same for i had
rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a
gentleman though he who played me false is nothing of the kind
to be brief all the talk and all that had happened ended in tosilos
being shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out all
hailed don quixote as victor but the greater number were vexed and
disappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously
waiting for had not battered one another to pieces just as the boys are
disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come
out because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him the people
dispersed the duke and don quixote returned to the castle they locked
up tosilos dona rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented
when they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage and tosilos
which treats of how don quixote took leave of the duke and of what
followed with the witty and impudent altisidora one of the duchesss
don quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was
leading in the castle for he fancied that he was making himself sorely
missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the
countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a
knight and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to
heaven of that indolence and seclusion and so one day he asked the duke
and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure they gave it
showing at the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them
the duchess gave his wifes letters to sancho panza who shed tears over
them saying who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news
of my government bred in my wife teresa panzas breast would end in my
going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master don quixote of la
mancha still im glad to see my teresa behaved as she ought in sending
the acorns for if she had not sent them id have been sorry and shed
have shown herself ungrateful it is a comfort to me that they cant call
that present a bribe for i had got the government already when she sent
them and its but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done
them should show their gratitude if its only with a trifle after all i
went into the government naked and i come out of it naked so i can say
with a safe conscience and thats no small matter naked i was born
naked i find myself i neither lose nor gain
thus did sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure as don
quixote who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess
coming out made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the
courtyard of the castle the whole household of the castle were watching
him from the corridors and the duke and duchess too came out to see
him sancho was mounted on his dapple with his alforjas valise and
proven supremely happy because the dukes majordomo the same that had
acted the part of the trifaldi had given him a little purse with two
hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road but of
this don quixote knew nothing as yet while all were as has been said
observing him suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the
impudent and witty altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic
bireno aeneas what worse shall i call thee
barabbas go with thee all evil befall thee
bireno aeneas what worse shall i call thee
barabbas go with thee all evil befall thee
bireno aeneas what worse shall i call thee
barabbas go with thee all evil befall thee
bireno aeneas what worse shall i call thee
barabbas go with thee all evil befall thee
all the while the unhappy altisidora was bewailing herself in the above
strain don quixote stood staring at her and without uttering a word in
reply to her he turned round to sancho and said sancho my friend i
conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth say hast
thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this
to this sancho made answer the three kerchiefs i have but the garters
as much as over the hills of ubeda
the duchess was amazed at altisidoras assurance she knew that she was
bold lively and impudent but not so much so as to venture to make free
in this fashion and not being prepared for the joke her astonishment
was all the greater the duke had a mind to keep up the sport so he
said it does not seem to me well done in you sir knight that after
having received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very
castle you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs not
to say my handmaids garters it shows a bad heart and does not tally
with your reputation restore her garters or else i defy you to mortal
combat for i am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering
my features as they changed his who encountered you into those of my
god forbid said don quixote that i should draw my sword against your
illustrious person from which i have received such great favours the
kerchiefs i will restore as sancho says he has them as to the garters
that is impossible for i have not got them neither has he and if your
handmaiden here will look in her hiding places depend upon it she will
find them i have never been a thief my lord duke nor do i mean to be
so long as i live if god cease not to have me in his keeping this
damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love for which i am not to
blame and therefore need not ask pardon either of her or of your
excellence whom i entreat to have a better opinion of me and once more
to give me leave to pursue my journey
and may god so prosper it senor don quixote said the duchess that
we may always hear good news of your exploits god speed you for the
longer you stay the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who
behold you and as for this one of mine i will so chastise her that she
will not transgress again either with her eyes or with her words
one word and no more o valiant don quixote i ask you to hear said
altisidora and that is that i beg your pardon about the theft of the
garters for by god and upon my soul i have got them on and i have
fallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being
didnt i say so said sancho im a likely one to hide thefts why if
i wanted to deal in them opportunities came ready enough to me in my
don quixote bowed his head and saluted the duke and duchess and all the
bystanders and wheeling rocinante round sancho following him on dapple
he rode out of the castle shaping his course for saragossa
which tells how adventures came crowding on don quixote in such numbers
that they gave one another no breathing time
when don quixote saw himself in open country free and relieved from the
attentions of altisidora he felt at his ease and in fresh spirits to
take up the pursuit of chivalry once more and turning to sancho he said
freedom sancho is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has
bestowed upon men no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea
conceals can compare with it for freedom as for honour life may and
should be ventured and on the other hand captivity is the greatest evil
that can fall to the lot of man i say this sancho because thou hast
seen the good cheer the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are
leaving well then amid those dainty banquets and snow cooled beverages
i felt as though i were undergoing the straits of hunger because i did
not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own for
the sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours
received is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit happy
he to whom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound
to give thanks to any but heaven itself
for all your worship says said sancho it is not becoming that there
should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that the
dukes majordomo has given me in a little purse which i carry next my
heart like a warming plaster or comforter to meet any chance calls for
we shant always find castles where theyll entertain us now and then we
may light upon roadside inns where theyll cudgel us
in conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing
their journey when after they had gone a little more than half a
league they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched
upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner
they had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some
objects under them standing upright or lying flat and arranged at
intervals don quixote approached the diners and saluting them
courteously first he asked them what it was those cloths covered
senor answered one of the party under these cloths are some images
carved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our village
we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled and on our
with your good leave said don quixote i should like to see them for
images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones
i should think they were said the other let the money they cost
speak for that for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that
does not stand us in more than fifty ducats and that your worship may
judge wait a moment and you shall see with your own eyes and getting
up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image which proved to
be one of saint george on horseback with a serpent writhing at his feet
and the lance thrust down its throat with all that fierceness that is
usually depicted the whole group was one blaze of gold as the saying
is on seeing it don quixote said that knight was one of the best
knights errant the army of heaven ever owned he was called don saint
george and he was moreover a defender of maidens let us see this next
the man uncovered it and it was seen to be that of saint martin on his
horse dividing his cloak with the beggar the instant don quixote saw it
he said this knight too was one of the christian adventurers but i
believe he was generous rather than valiant as thou mayest perceive
sancho by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half of
it no doubt it was winter at the time for otherwise he would have given
him the whole of it so charitable was he
it was not that most likely said sancho but that he held with the
proverb that says for giving and keeping theres need of brains
don quixote laughed and asked them to take off the next cloth
underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the spains
seated on horseback his sword stained with blood trampling on moors and
treading heads underfoot and on seeing it don quixote exclaimed ay
this is a knight and of the squadrons of christ this one is called don
saint james the moorslayer one of the bravest saints and knights the
they then raised another cloth which it appeared covered saint paul
falling from his horse with all the details that are usually given in
representations of his conversion when don quixote saw it rendered in
such lifelike style that one would have said christ was speaking and paul
answering this he said was in his time the greatest enemy that the
church of god our lord had and the greatest champion it will ever have
a knight errant in life a steadfast saint in death an untiring labourer
in the lords vineyard a teacher of the gentiles whose school was
heaven and whose instructor and master was jesus christ himself
there were no more images so don quixote bade them cover them up again
and said to those who had brought them i take it as a happy omen
brothers to have seen what i have for these saints and knights were of
the same profession as myself which is the calling of arms only there
is this difference between them and me that they were saints and fought
with divine weapons and i am a sinner and fight with human ones they
won heaven by force of arms for heaven suffereth violence and i so
far know not what i have won by dint of my sufferings but if my
dulcinea del toboso were to be released from hers perhaps with mended
fortunes and a mind restored to itself i might direct my steps in a
better path than i am following at present
may god hear and sin be deaf said sancho to this
the men were filled with wonder as well at the figure as at the words of
don quixote though they did not understand one half of what he meant by
them they finished their dinner took their images on their backs and
bidding farewell to don quixote resumed their journey
sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his masters knowledge as much
as if he had never known him for it seemed to him that there was no
story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers ends and
fixed in his memory and he said to him in truth master mine if this
that has happened to us to day is to be called an adventure it has been
one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the whole
course of our travels we have come out of it unbelaboured and
undismayed neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth
with our bodies nor have we been left famishing blessed be god that he
has let me see such a thing with my own eyes
thou sayest well sancho said don quixote but remember all times are
not alike nor do they always run the same way and these things the
vulgar commonly call omens which are not based upon any natural reason
will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy accidents merely
one of these believers in omens will get up of a morning leave his
house and meet a friar of the order of the blessed saint francis and
as if he had met a griffin he will turn about and go home with another
mendoza the salt is spilt on his table and gloom is spilt over his
heart as if nature was obliged to give warning of coming misfortunes by
means of such trivial things as these the wise man and the christian
should not trifle with what it may please heaven to do scipio on coming
to africa stumbled as he leaped on shore his soldiers took it as a bad
omen but he clasping the soil with his arms exclaimed thou canst not
escape me africa for i hold thee tight between my arms thus sancho
meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence
i can well believe it said sancho but i wish your worship would tell
me what is the reason that the spaniards when they are about to give
battle in calling on that saint james the moorslayer say santiago and
close spain is spain then open so that it is needful to close it or
thou art very simple sancho said don quixote god look you gave
that great knight of the red cross to spain as her patron saint and
protector especially in those hard struggles the spaniards had with the
moors and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their defender in
all their battles and in these he has been many a time seen beating
down trampling under foot destroying and slaughtering the hagarene
squadrons in the sight of all of which fact i could give thee many
sancho changed the subject and said to his master i marvel senor at
the boldness of altisidora the duchesss handmaid he whom they call
love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her they say he is a little
blind urchin who though blear eyed or more properly speaking sightless
if he aims at a heart be it ever so small hits it and pierces it
through and through with his arrows i have heard it said too that the
arrows of love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty
and reserve but with this altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather
bear in mind sancho said don quixote that love is influenced by no
consideration recognises no restraints of reason and is of the same
nature as death that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the
humble cabins of shepherds and when it takes entire possession of a
heart the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it and
so without shame altisidora declared her passion which excited in my
notable cruelty exclaimed sancho unheard of ingratitude i can only
say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would have
subdued me and made a slave of me the devil what a heart of marble
what bowels of brass what a soul of mortar but i cant imagine what it
is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have conquered and
captivated her so what gallant figure was it what bold bearing what
sprightly grace what comeliness of feature which of these things by
itself or what all together could have made her fall in love with you
for indeed and in truth many a time i stop to look at your worship from
the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head and i see more to
frighten one than to make one fall in love moreover i have heard say
that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love and as your
worship has none at all i dont know what the poor creature fell in love
recollect sancho replied don quixote there are two sorts of beauty
one of the mind the other of the body that of the mind displays and
exhibits itself in intelligence in modesty in honourable conduct in
generosity in good breeding and all these qualities are possible and
may exist in an ugly man and when it is this sort of beauty and not that
of the body that is the attraction love is apt to spring up suddenly and
violently i sancho perceive clearly enough that i am not beautiful
but at the same time i know i am not hideous and it is enough for an
honest man not to be a monster to be an object of love if only he
possesses the endowments of mind i have mentioned
while engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood
that lay beyond the road when suddenly without expecting anything of
the kind don quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord
stretched from one tree to another and unable to conceive what it could
be he said to sancho sancho it strikes me this affair of these nets
will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable may i die if the
enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and
delay my journey by way of revenge for my obduracy towards altisidora
well then let me tell them that if these nets instead of being green
cord were made of the hardest diamonds or stronger than that wherewith
the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed venus and mars i would break
them as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads but
just as he was about to press forward and break through all suddenly
from among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented
themselves to his sight or at least damsels dressed like shepherdesses
save that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade that is to say
the sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroidered tabby their hair
that in its golden brightness vied with the beams of the sun itself fell
loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with
green laurel and red everlasting and their years to all appearance were
such was the spectacle that filled sancho with amazement fascinated don
quixote made the sun halt in his course to behold them and held all
four in a strange silence one of the shepherdesses at length was the
first to speak and said to don quixote hold sir knight and do not
break these nets for they are not spread here to do you any harm but
only for our amusement and as i know you will ask why they have been put
up and who we are i will tell you in a few words in a village some two
leagues from this where there are many people of quality and rich
gentlefolk it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to
come with their wives sons and daughters neighbours friends and
kinsmen and make holiday in this spot which is one of the pleasantest
in the whole neighbourhood setting up a new pastoral arcadia among
ourselves we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youths
as shepherds we have prepared two eclogues one by the famous poet
garcilasso the other by the most excellent camoens in its own
portuguese tongue but we have not as yet acted them yesterday was the
first day of our coming here we have a few of what they say are called
field tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that
fertilises all these meadows last night we spread these nets in the
trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by the noise we
make may fly into them if you please to be our guest senor you will be
welcomed heartily and courteously for here just now neither care nor
she held her peace and said no more and don quixote made answer of a
truth fairest lady actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld diana bathing in
the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than i at
the sight of your beauty i commend your mode of entertainment and thank
you for the kindness of your invitation and if i can serve you you may
command me with full confidence of being obeyed for my profession is
none other than to show myself grateful and ready to serve persons of
all conditions but especially persons of quality such as your appearance
indicates and if instead of taking up as they probably do but a small
space these nets took up the whole surface of the globe i would seek
out new worlds through which to pass so as not to break them and that
ye may give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine
know that it is no less than don quixote of la mancha that makes this
declaration to you if indeed it be that such a name has reached your
ah friend of my soul instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess what
great good fortune has befallen us seest thou this gentleman we have
before us well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and the most
devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world unless a
history of his achievements that has been printed and i have read is
telling lies and deceiving us i will lay a wager that this good fellow
who is with him is one sancho panza his squire whose drolleries none can
thats true said sancho i am that same droll and squire you speak
of and this gentleman is my master don quixote of la mancha the same
thats in the history and that they talk about
oh my friend said the other let us entreat him to stay for it will
give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure i too have heard just
what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the
other and what is more of him they say that he is the most constant and
loyal lover that was ever heard of and that his lady is one dulcinea del
toboso to whom all over spain the palm of beauty is awarded
and justly awarded said don quixote unless indeed your unequalled
beauty makes it a matter of doubt but spare yourselves the trouble
ladies of pressing me to stay for the urgent calls of my profession do
not allow me to take rest under any circumstances
at this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother
of one of the two shepherdesses like them in shepherd costume and as
richly and gaily dressed as they were they told him that their companion
was the valiant don quixote of la mancha and the other sancho his
squire of whom he knew already from having read their history the gay
shepherd offered him his services and begged that he would accompany him
to their tents and don quixote had to give way and comply and now the
gave was started and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that
deceived by the colour fell into the danger they were flying from
upwards of thirty persons all gaily attired as shepherds and
shepherdesses assembled on the spot and were at once informed who don
quixote and his squire were whereat they were not a little delighted as
they knew of him already through his history they repaired to the tents
where they found tables laid out and choicely plentifully and neatly
furnished they treated don quixote as a person of distinction giving
him the place of honour and all observed him and were full of
astonishment at the spectacle at last the cloth being removed don
quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said
one of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is some will say
pride but i say ingratitude going by the common saying that hell is
full of ingrates this sin so far as it has lain in my power i have
endeavoured to avoid ever since i have enjoyed the faculty of reason and
if i am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by other
deeds i substitute the desire to do so and if that be not enough i make
them known publicly for he who declares and makes known the good deeds
done to him would repay them by others if it were in his power and for
the most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give
thus god is superior to all because he is the supreme giver and the
offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full
return for the gifts of god but gratitude in some degree makes up for
this deficiency and shortcoming i therefore grateful for the favour
that has been extended to me here and unable to make a return in the
same measure restricted as i am by the narrow limits of my power offer
what i can and what i have to offer in my own way and so i declare that
for two full days i will maintain in the middle of this highway leading
to saragossa that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses who are here
present are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world
excepting only the peerless dulcinea del toboso sole mistress of my
thoughts be it said without offence to those who hear me ladies and
on hearing this sancho who had been listening with great attention
cried out in a loud voice is it possible there is anyone in the world
who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman say
gentlemen shepherds is there a village priest be he ever so wise or
learned who could say what my master has said or is there
knight errant whatever renown he may have as a man of valour that could
don quixote turned upon sancho and with a countenance glowing with anger
said to him is it possible sancho there is anyone in the whole world
who will say thou art not a fool with a lining to match and i know not
what trimmings of impertinence and roguery who asked thee to meddle in
my affairs or to inquire whether i am a wise man or a blockhead hold
thy peace answer me not a word saddle rocinante if he be unsaddled and
let us go to put my offer into execution for with the right that i have
on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to
question it and in a great rage and showing his anger plainly he rose
from his seat leaving the company lost in wonder and making them feel
doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational
being in the end though they sought to dissuade him from involving
himself in such a challenge assuring him they admitted his gratitude as
fully established and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his
valiant spirit as those related in the history of his exploits were
sufficient still don quixote persisted in his resolve and mounted on
rocinante bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance he
posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the
green meadow sancho followed on dapple together with all the members of
the pastoral gathering eager to see what would be the upshot of his
don quixote then having as has been said planted himself in the
middle of the road made the welkin ring with words to this effect ho
ye travellers and wayfarers knights squires folk on foot or on
horseback who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two
days know that don quixote of la mancha knight errant is posted here
to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs
that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth putting
aside the lady of my heart dulcinea del toboso wherefore let him who
is of the opposite opinion come on for here i await him
twice he repeated the same words and twice they fell unheard by any
adventurer but fate that was guiding affairs for him from better to
better so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road
a crowd of men on horseback many of them with lances in their hands all
riding in a compact body and in great haste no sooner had those who were
with don quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some
distance from the road for they knew that if they stayed some harm might
come to them but don quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground and
sancho panza shielded himself with rocinantes hind quarters the troop
of lancers came up and one of them who was in advance began shouting to
don quixote get out of the way you son of the devil or these bulls
rabble returned don quixote i care nothing for bulls be they the
fiercest jarama breeds on its banks confess at once scoundrels that
what i have declared is true else ye have to deal with me in combat
the herdsman had no time to reply nor don quixote to get out of the way
even if he wished and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks
together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be
penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day passed
over don quixote and over sancho rocinante and dapple hurling them all
to the earth and rolling them over on the ground sancho was left
crushed don quixote scared dapple belaboured and rocinante in no very
they all got up however at length and don quixote in great haste
stumbling here and falling there started off running after the drove
shouting out hold stay ye rascally rabble a single knight awaits
you and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say for a
flying enemy make a bridge of silver the retreating party in their
haste however did not stop for that or heed his menaces any more than
last years clouds weariness brought don quixote to a halt and more
enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until sancho
rocinante and dapple came up when they reached him master and man
mounted once more and without going back to bid farewell to the mock or
imitation arcadia and more in humiliation than contentment they
wherein is related the strange thing which may be regarded as an
a clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved don
quixote and sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour
of the bulls and by the side of this having turned dapple and rocinante
loose without headstall or bridle the forlorn pair master and man
seated themselves sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and
took out of them what he called the prog don quixote rinsed his mouth
and bathed his face by which cooling process his flagging energies were
revived out of pure vexation he remained without eating and out of pure
politeness sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before
him but waited for his master to act as taster seeing however that
absorbed in thought he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth
he said never a word and trampling every sort of good breeding under
foot began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to
eat sancho my friend said don quixote support life which is of
more consequence to thee than to me and leave me to die under the pain
of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes i was born sancho to
live dying and thou to die eating and to prove the truth of what i say
look at me printed in histories famed in arms courteous in behaviour
honoured by princes courted by maidens and after all when i looked
forward to palms triumphs and crowns won and earned by my valiant
deeds i have this morning seen myself trampled on kicked and crushed
by the feet of unclean and filthy animals this thought blunts my teeth
paralyses my jaws cramps my hands and robs me of all appetite for food
so much so that i have a mind to let myself die of hunger the cruelest
so then said sancho munching hard all the time your worship does
not agree with the proverb that says let martha die but let her die
with a full belly i at any rate have no mind to kill myself so far
from that i mean to do as the cobbler does who stretches the leather
with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants ill stretch
out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it
and let me tell you senor theres no greater folly than to think of
dying of despair as your worship does take my advice and after eating
lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass mattress and you will see
that when you awake youll feel something better
don quixote did as he recommended for it struck him that sanchos
reasoning was more like a philosophers than a blockheads and said he
sancho if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell thee my ease of
mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great and it
is this to go aside a little while i am sleeping in accordance with thy
advice and making bare thy carcase to the air to give thyself three or
four hundred lashes with rocinantes reins on account of the three
thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of
dulcinea for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left
there is a good deal to be said on that point said sancho let us
both go to sleep now and after that god has decreed what will happen
let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is
a hard thing especially if the stripes fall upon an ill nourished and
worse fed body let my lady dulcinea have patience and when she is least
expecting it she will see me made a riddle of with whipping and until
death its all life i mean that i have still life in me and the desire
don quixote thanked him and ate a little and sancho a good deal and
then they both lay down to sleep leaving those two inseparable friends
and comrades rocinante and dapple to their own devices and to feed
unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished
they woke up rather late mounted once more and resumed their journey
pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight apparently a league off i
say an inn because don quixote called it so contrary to his usual
practice of calling all inns castles they reached it and asked the
landlord if they could put up there he said yes with as much comfort
and as good fare as they could find in saragossa they dismounted and
sancho stowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him
the key he took the beasts to the stable fed them and came back to see
what orders don quixote who was seated on a bench at the door had for
him giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for
a castle by his master supper time came and they repaired to their
room and sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper
to this the landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure he had
only to ask what he would for that inn was provided with the birds of
the air and the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea
theres no need of all that said sancho if theyll roast us a couple
of chickens well be satisfied for my master is delicate and eats
little and im not over and above gluttonous
the landlord replied he had no chickens for the kites had stolen them
well then said sancho let senor landlord tell them to roast a
pullet so that it is a tender one
pullet my father said the landlord indeed and in truth its only
yesterday i sent over fifty to the city to sell but saving pullets ask
in that case said sancho you will not be without veal or kid
just now said the landlord theres none in the house for its all
finished but next week there will be enough and to spare
much good that does us said sancho ill lay a bet that all these
short comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs
by god said the landlord my guests wits must be precious dull i
tell him i have neither pullets nor hens and he wants me to have eggs
talk of other dainties if you please and dont ask for hens again
body o me said sancho lets settle the matter say at once what you
have got and let us have no more words about it
in truth and earnest senor guest said the landlord all i have is a
couple of cow heels like calves feet or a couple of calves feet like
cowheels they are boiled with chick peas onions and bacon and at this
moment they are crying come eat me come eat me
i mark them for mine on the spot said sancho let nobody touch them
ill pay better for them than anyone else for i could not wish for
anything more to my taste and i dont care a pin whether they are feet
nobody shall touch them said the landlord for the other guests i
have being persons of high quality bring their own cook and caterer and
if you come to people of quality said sancho theres nobody more so
than my master but the calling he follows does not allow of larders or
store rooms we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow and fill
here ended sanchos conversation with the landlord sancho not caring to
carry it any farther by answering him for he had already asked him what
calling or what profession it was his master was of
supper time having come then don quixote betook himself to his room
the landlord brought in the stew pan just as it was and he sat himself
down to sup very resolutely it seems that in another room which was
next to don quixotes with nothing but a thin partition to separate it
he overheard these words as you live senor don jeronimo while they
are bringing supper let us read another chapter of the second part of
the instant don quixote heard his own name be started to his feet and
listened with open ears to catch what they said about him and heard the
don jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply why would you have us
read that absurd stuff don juan when it is impossible for anyone who
has read the first part of the history of don quixote of la mancha to
take any pleasure in reading this second part
for all that said he who was addressed as don juan we shall do well
to read it for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it
what displeases me most in it is that it represents don quixote as now
cured of his love for dulcinea del toboso
on hearing this don quixote full of wrath and indignation lifted up his
voice and said whoever he may be who says that don quixote of la mancha
has forgotten or can forget dulcinea del toboso i will teach him with
equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth for neither can
the peerless dulcinea del toboso be forgotten nor can forgetfulness have
a place in don quixote his motto is constancy and his profession to
maintain the same with his life and never wrong it
who is this that answers us said they in the next room
who should it be said sancho but don quixote of la mancha himself
who will make good all he has said and all he will say for pledges dont
sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen for such they
seemed to be entered the room and one of them throwing his arms round
don quixotes neck said to him your appearance cannot leave any
question as to your name nor can your name fail to identify your
appearance unquestionably senor you are the real don quixote of la
mancha cynosure and morning star of knight errantry despite and in
defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught
your achievements as the author of this book which i here present to you
has done and with this he put a book which his companion carried into
the hands of don quixote who took it and without replying began to run
his eye over it but he presently returned it saying in the little i
have seen i have discovered three things in this author that deserve to
be censured the first is some words that i have read in the preface the
next that the language is aragonese for sometimes he writes without
articles and the third which above all stamps him as ignorant is that
he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of
the history for here he says that my squire sancho panzas wife is
called mari gutierrez when she is called nothing of the sort but teresa
panza and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is
good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
a nice sort of historian indeed exclaimed sancho at this he must
know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife teresa panza mari
gutierrez take the book again senor and see if i am in it and if he
from your talk friend said don jeronimo no doubt you are sancho
