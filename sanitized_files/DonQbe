same desire i will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou
art to come and live with me or not dapple is well and sends many
remembrances to thee i am not going to leave him behind though they took
me away to be grand turk my lady the duchess kisses thy hands a thousand
times do thou make a return with two thousand for as my master says
nothing costs less or is cheaper than civility god has not been pleased
to provide another valise for me with another hundred crowns like the
one the other day but never mind my teresa the bell ringer is in safe
quarters and all will come out in the scouring of the government only
it troubles me greatly what they tell me that once i have tasted it i
will eat my hands off after it and if that is so it will not come very
cheap to me though to be sure the maimed have a benefice of their own in
the alms they beg for so that one way or another thou wilt be rich and
in luck god give it to thee as he can and keep me to serve thee from
when she had done reading the letter the duchess said to sancho on two
points the worthy governor goes rather astray one is in saying or
hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes
that he is to give himself when he knows and he cannot deny it that
when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a
thing as lashes the other is that he shows himself here to be very
covetous and i would not have him a money seeker for covetousness
bursts the bag and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice
i dont mean it that way senora said sancho and if you think the
letter doesnt run as it ought to do its only to tear it up and make
another and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption
no no said the duchess this one will do and i wish the duke to see
with this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine and
the duchess showed sanchos letter to the duke who was highly delighted
with it they dined and after the cloth had been removed and they had
amused themselves for a while with sanchos rich conversation the
melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itself heard
all seemed somewhat put out by this dull confused martial harmony
especially don quixote who could not keep his seat from pure
disquietude as to sancho it is needless to say that fear drove him to
his usual refuge the side or the skirts of the duchess and indeed and
in truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one
while they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them
through the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing
that they trailed upon the ground as they marched they beat two great
drums which were likewise draped in black and beside them came the fife
player black and sombre like the others following these came a
personage of gigantic stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of the
deepest black the skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions over the
gown girdling or crossing his figure he had a broad baldric which was
also black and from which hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and
furniture he had his face covered with a transparent black veil through
which might be descried a very long beard as white as snow he came on
keeping step to the sound of the drums with great gravity and dignity
and in short his stature his gait the sombreness of his appearance
and his following might well have struck with astonishment as they did
all who beheld him without knowing who he was with this measured pace
and in this guise he advanced to kneel before the duke who with the
others awaited him standing the duke however would not on any account
allow him to speak until he had risen the prodigious scarecrow obeyed
and standing up removed the veil from his face and disclosed the most
enormous the longest the whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes
had ever beheld until that moment and then fetching up a grave sonorous
voice from the depths of his broad capacious chest and fixing his eyes
most high and mighty senor my name is trifaldin of the white beard i
am squire to the countess trifaldi otherwise called the distressed
duenna on whose behalf i bear a message to your highness which is that
your magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave and permission to
come and tell you her trouble which is one of the strangest and most
wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the world could
have imagined but first she desires to know if the valiant and never
vanquished knight don quixote of la mancha is in this your castle for
she has come in quest of him on foot and without breaking her fast from
the kingdom of kandy to your realms here a thing which may and ought to
be regarded as a miracle or set down to enchantment she is even now at
the gate of this fortress or plaisance and only waits for your
permission to enter i have spoken and with that he coughed and
stroked down his beard with both his hands and stood very tranquilly
waiting for the response of the duke which was to this effect many
days ago worthy squire trifaldin of the white beard we heard of the
misfortune of my lady the countess trifaldi whom the enchanters have
caused to be called the distressed duenna bid her enter o stupendous
squire and tell her that the valiant knight don quixote of la mancha is
here and from his generous disposition she may safely promise herself
every protection and assistance and you may tell her too that if my
aid be necessary it will not be withheld for i am bound to give it to
her by my quality of knight which involves the protection of women of
all sorts especially widowed wronged and distressed dames such as her
on hearing this trifaldin bent the knee to the ground and making a sign
to the fifer and drummers to strike up he turned and marched out of the
garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he entered leaving
them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity turning to don quixote the
duke said after all renowned knight the mists of malice and ignorance
are unable to hide or obscure the light of valour and virtue i say so
because your excellence has been barely six days in this castle and
already the unhappy and the afflicted come in quest of you from lands far
distant and remote and not in coaches or on dromedaries but on foot and
fasting confident that in that mighty arm they will find a cure for
their sorrows and troubles thanks to your great achievements which are
i wish senor duke replied don quixote that blessed ecclesiastic
who at table the other day showed such ill will and bitter spite against
knights errant were here now to see with his own eyes whether knights of
the sort are needed in the world he would at any rate learn by
experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction or sorrow
in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for a remedy
to the houses of jurists or village sacristans or to the knight who has
never attempted to pass the bounds of his own town or to the indolent
courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of instead of
striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and record relief
in distress help in need protection for damsels consolation for
widows are to be found in no sort of persons better than in
knights errant and i give unceasing thanks to heaven that i am one and
regard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the pursuit of
so honourable a calling as endured to good purpose let this duenna come
and ask what she will for i will effect her relief by the might of my
arm and the dauntless resolution of my bold heart
wherein is continued the notable adventure of the distressed duenna
the duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily don quixote
fell in with their scheme but at this moment sancho observed i hope
this senora duenna wont be putting any difficulties in the way of the
promise of my government for i have heard a toledo apothecary who
talked like a goldfinch say that where duennas were mixed up nothing
good could happen god bless me how he hated them that same apothecary
and so what im thinking is if all duennas of whatever sort or
condition they may be are plagues and busybodies what must they be that
are distressed like this countess three skirts or three tails for in
my country skirts or tails tails or skirts its all one
hush friend sancho said don quixote since this lady duenna comes in
quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the
apothecary meant moreover this is a countess and when countesses serve
as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses for in their own
houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas to wait on
to this dona rodriguez who was present made answer my lady the
duchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was the
will of fortune but laws go as kings like let nobody speak ill of
duennas above all of ancient maiden ones for though i am not one
myself i know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over one
that is a widow but he who clipped us has kept the scissors
for all that said sancho theres so much to be clipped about
duennas so my barber said that it will be better not to stir the rice
these squires returned dona rodriguez are always our enemies and as
they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us at every
step whenever they are not saying their prayers and thats often
enough they spend their time in tattling about us digging up our bones
and burying our good name but i can tell these walking blocks that we
will live in spite of them and in great houses too though we die of
hunger and cover our flesh be it delicate or not with widows weeds as
one covers or hides a dunghill on a procession day by my faith if it
were permitted me and time allowed i could prove not only to those here
present but to all the world that there is no virtue that is not to be
i have no doubt said the duchess that my good dona rodriguez is
right and very much so but she had better bide her time for fighting
her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas so as to crush the
calumny of that vile apothecary and root out the prejudice in the great
to which sancho replied ever since i have sniffed the governorship i
have got rid of the humours of a squire and i dont care a wild fig for
they would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard
the notes of the fife and drums once more from which they concluded that
the distressed duenna was making her entrance the duchess asked the duke
if it would be proper to go out to receive her as she was a countess and
in respect of her being a countess said sancho before the duke could
reply i am for your highnesses going out to receive her but in respect
of her being a duenna it is my opinion you should not stir a step
who bade thee meddle in this sancho said don quixote
who senor said sancho i meddle for i have a right to meddle as a
squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your
worship the most courteous and best bred knight in the whole world of
courtliness and in these things as i have heard your worship say as
much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few and to one who has
sancho is right said the duke well see what the countess is like
and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her
and now the drums and fife made their entrance as before and here the
author brought this short chapter to an end and began the next following
up the same adventure which is one of the most notable in the history
wherein is told the distressed duennas tale of her misfortunes
following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as
twelve duennas in two lines all dressed in ample mourning robes
apparently of milled serge with hoods of fine white gauze so long that
they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen behind them came the
countess trifaldi the squire trifaldin of the white beard leading her by
the hand clad in the finest unnapped black baize such that had it a
nap every tuft would have shown as big as a martos chickpea the tail
or skirt or whatever it might be called ended in three points which
were borne up by the hands of three pages likewise dressed in mourning
forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by
the three points from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that
it must be because of it the countess was called trifaldi as though it
were countess of the three skirts and benengeli says it was so and that
by her right name she was called the countess lobuna because wolves bred
in great numbers in her country and if instead of wolves they had been
foxes she would have been called the countess zorruna as it was the
custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing
or things most abundant in their dominions this countess however in
honour of the new fashion of her skirt dropped lobuna and took up
the twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace their faces
being covered with black veils not transparent ones like trifaldins
but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them as soon
as the band of duennas was fully in sight the duke the duchess and don
quixote stood up as well as all who were watching the slow moving
procession the twelve duennas halted and formed a lane along which the
distressed one advanced trifaldin still holding her hand on seeing this
the duke the duchess and don quixote went some twelve paces forward to
meet her she then kneeling on the ground said in a voice hoarse and
rough rather than fine and delicate may it please your highnesses not
to offer such courtesies to this your servant i should say to this your
handmaid for i am in such distress that i shall never be able to make a
proper return because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has carried
off my wits and i know not whither but it must be a long way off for
the more i look for them the less i find them
he would be wanting in wits senora countess said the duke who did
not perceive your worth by your person for at a glance it may be seen it
deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage and
raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess who
likewise received her with great urbanity don quixote remained silent
while sancho was dying to see the features of trifaldi and one or two of
her many duennas but there was no possibility of it until they
themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will
all kept still waiting to see who would break silence which the
distressed duenna did in these words i am confident most mighty lord
most fair lady and most discreet company that my most miserable misery
will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous and
condolent in your most valiant bosoms for it is one that is enough to
melt marble soften diamonds and mollify the steel of the most hardened
hearts in the world but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing not to say
your ears i would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this
society circle or company that knight immaculatissimus don quixote de
the panza is here said sancho before anyone could reply and don
quixotissimus too and so most distressedest duenissima you may say
what you willissimus for we are all readissimus to do you any
on this don quixote rose and addressing the distressed duenna said if
your sorrows afflicted lady can indulge in any hope of relief from the
valour or might of any knight errant here are mine which feeble and
limited though they be shall be entirely devoted to your service i am
don quixote of la mancha whose calling it is to give aid to the needy of
all sorts and that being so it is not necessary for you senora to
make any appeal to benevolence or deal in preambles only to tell your
woes plainly and straightforwardly for you have hearers that will know
how if not to remedy them to sympathise with them
on hearing this the distressed duenna made as though she would throw
herself at don quixotes feet and actually did fall before them and
said as she strove to embrace them before these feet and legs i cast
myself o unconquered knight as before what they are the foundations
and pillars of knight errantry these feet i desire to kiss for upon
their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune o
valorous errant whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse
the fabulous ones of the amadises esplandians and belianises then
turning from don quixote to sancho panza and grasping his hands she
said o thou most loyal squire that ever served knight errant in this
present age or ages past whose goodness is more extensive than the beard
of trifaldin my companion here of present well mayest thou boast thyself
that in serving the great don quixote thou art serving summed up in
one the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world i
conjure thee by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness that thou
wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master that he speedily give
aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess
to this sancho made answer as to my goodness senora being as long and
as great as your squires beard it matters very little to me may i have
my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit this life
thats the point about beards here below i care little or nothing but
without all these blandishments and prayers i will beg my master for i
know he loves me and besides he has need of me just now for a certain
business to help and aid your worship as far as he can unpack your woes
and lay them before us and leave us to deal with them for well be all
the duke and duchess as it was they who had made the experiment of this
adventure were ready to burst with laughter at all this and between
themselves they commended the clever acting of the trifaldi who
returning to her seat said queen dona maguncia reigned over the famous
kingdom of kandy which lies between the great trapobana and the southern
sea two leagues beyond cape comorin she was the widow of king
archipiela her lord and husband and of their marriage they had issue
the princess antonomasia heiress of the kingdom which princess
antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction i
being the oldest and highest in rank of her mothers duennas time
passed and the young antonomasia reached the age of fourteen and such a
perfection of beauty that nature could not raise it higher then it
must not be supposed her intelligence was childish she was as
intelligent as she was fair and she was fairer than all the world and
is so still unless the envious fates and hard hearted sisters three have
cut for her the thread of life but that they have not for heaven will
not suffer so great a wrong to earth as it would be to pluck unripe the
grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface of this beauty to which
my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice countless princes not
only of that country but of others were enamoured and among them a
private gentleman who was at the court dared to raise his thoughts to
the heaven of so great beauty trusting to his youth his gallant
bearing his numerous accomplishments and graces and his quickness and
readiness of wit for i may tell your highnesses if i am not wearying
you that he played the guitar so as to make it speak and he was
besides a poet and a great dancer and he could make birdcages so well
that by making them alone he might have gained a livelihood had he found
himself reduced to utter poverty and gifts and graces of this kind are
enough to bring down a mountain not to say a tender young girl but all
his gallantry wit and gaiety all his graces and accomplishments would
have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil
had not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first
first the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good will and
purchase my compliance so as to get me like a treacherous warder to
deliver up to him the keys of the fortress i had in charge in a word he
gained an influence over my mind and overcame my resolutions with i know
not what trinkets and jewels he gave me but it was some verses i heard
him singing one night from a grating that opened on the street where he
lived that more than anything else made me give way and led to my
fall and if i remember rightly they ran thus
the lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup and
afterwards i may say ever since then looking at the misfortune into
which i have fallen i have thought that poets as plato advised ought
to be banished from all well ordered states at least the amatory ones
for they write verses not like those of the marquis of mantua that
delight and draw tears from the women and children but sharp pointed
conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns and like the lightning
strike it leaving the raiment uninjured another time he sang
to find how sweet it is to die
and other verses and burdens of the same sort such as enchant when
sung and fascinate when written and then when they condescend to
compose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in kandy which
they call seguidillas then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks
forth and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver
and so i say sirs that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished
to the isles of the lizards though it is not they that are in fault but
the simpletons that extol them and the fools that believe in them and
had i been the faithful duenna i should have been his stale conceits
would have never moved me nor should i have been taken in by such
phrases as in death i live in ice i burn in flames i shiver
hopeless i hope i go and stay and paradoxes of that sort which
their writings are full of and then when they promise the phoenix of
arabia the crown of ariadne the horses of the sun the pearls of the
south the gold of tibar and the balsam of panchaia then it is they
give a loose to their pens for it costs them little to make promises
they have no intention or power of fulfilling but where am i wandering
to woe is me unfortunate being what madness or folly leads me to speak
of the faults of others when there is so much to be said about my own
again woe is me hapless that i am it was not verses that conquered me
but my own simplicity it was not music made me yield but my own
imprudence my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way and
cleared the path for don clavijos advances for that was the name of the
gentleman i have referred to and so with my help as go between he
found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived antonomasia
deceived not by him but by me under the title of a lawful husband for
sinner though i was would not have allowed him to approach the edge of
her shoe sole without being her husband no no not that marriage must
come first in any business of this sort that i take in hand but there
was one hitch in this case which was that of inequality of rank don
clavijo being a private gentleman and the princess antonomasia as i
said heiress to the kingdom the entanglement remained for some time a
secret kept hidden by my cunning precautions until i perceived that a
certain expansion of waist in antonomasia must before long disclose it
the dread of which made us all there take counsel together and it was
agreed that before the mischief came to light don clavijo should demand
antonomasia as his wife before the vicar in virtue of an agreement to
marry him made by the princess and drafted by my wit in such binding
terms that the might of samson could not have broken it the necessary
steps were taken the vicar saw the agreement and took the ladys
confession she confessed everything in full and he ordered her into the
custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court
are there alguacils of the court in kandy too said sancho at this
and poets and seguidillas i swear i think the world is the same all
over but make haste senora trifaldi for it is late and i am dying to
in which the trifaldi continues her marvellous and memorable story
by every word that sancho uttered the duchess was as much delighted as
don quixote was driven to desperation he bade him hold his tongue and
the distressed one went on to say at length after much questioning and
answering as the princess held to her story without changing or varying
her previous declaration the vicar gave his decision in favour of don
clavijo and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife which the
queen dona maguncia the princess antonomasias mother so took to heart
that within the space of three days we buried her
of course said trifaldin they dont bury living people in kandy
senor squire said sancho a man in a swoon has been known to be
buried before now in the belief that he was dead and it struck me that
queen maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died because with life
a great many things come right and the princesss folly was not so great
that she need feel it so keenly if the lady had married some page of
hers or some other servant of the house as many another has done so i
have heard say then the mischief would have been past curing but to
marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now
described to us indeed indeed though it was a folly it was not such a
great one as you think for according to the rules of my master here and
he wont allow me to lie as of men of letters bishops are made so of
gentlemen knights specially if they be errant kings and emperors may be
thou art right sancho said don quixote for with a knight errant if
he has but two fingers breadth of good fortune it is on the cards to
become the mightiest lord on earth but let senora the distressed one
proceed for i suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part of this
the bitter is indeed to come said the countess and such bitter that
colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison the queen then
being dead and not in a swoon we buried her and hardly had we covered
her with earth hardly had we said our last farewells when quis talia
fando temperet a lachrymis over the queens grave there appeared
mounted upon a wooden horse the giant malambruno maguncias first
cousin who besides being cruel is an enchanter and he to revenge the
death of his cousin punish the audacity of don clavijo and in wrath at
the contumacy of antonomasia left them both enchanted by his art on the
grave itself she being changed into an ape of brass and he into a
horrible crocodile of some unknown metal while between the two there
stands a pillar also of metal with certain characters in the syriac
language inscribed upon it which being translated into kandian and now
into castilian contain the following sentence these two rash lovers
shall not recover their former shape until the valiant manchegan comes to
do battle with me in single combat for the fates reserve this unexampled
adventure for his mighty valour alone this done he drew from its
sheath a huge broad scimitar and seizing me by the hair he made as
though he meant to cut my throat and shear my head clean off i was
terror stricken my voice stuck in my throat and i was in the deepest
distress nevertheless i summoned up my strength as well as i could and
in a trembling and piteous voice i addressed such words to him as induced
him to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe he then caused all
the duennas of the palace those that are here present to be brought
before him and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence and
denounced duennas their characters their evil ways and worse intrigues
laying to the charge of all what i alone was guilty of he said he would
not visit us with capital punishment but with others of a slow nature
which would be in effect civil death for ever and the very instant he
ceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening and pricking
us as if with the points of needles we at once put our hands up to our
faces and found ourselves in the state you now see
here the distressed one and the other duennas raised the veils with which
they were covered and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards
some red some black some white and some grizzled at which spectacle
the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder don quixote
and sancho were overwhelmed with amazement and the bystanders lost in
astonishment while the trifaldi went on to say thus did that
malevolent villain malambruno punish us covering the tenderness and
softness of our faces with these rough bristles would to heaven that he
had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring
the light of our countenances with these wool combings that cover us for
if we look into the matter sirs and what i am now going to say i would
say with eyes flowing like fountains only that the thought of our
misfortune and the oceans they have already wept keep them as dry as
barley spears and so i say it without tears where i ask can a duenna
with a beard to to what father or mother will feel pity for her who
will help her for if even when she has a smooth skin and a face
tortured by a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics she can hardly get
anybody to love her what will she do when she shows a countenace turned
into a thicket oh duennas companions mine it was an unlucky moment
when we were born and an ill starred hour when our fathers begot us and
as she said this she showed signs of being about to faint
of matters relating and belonging to this adventure and to this memorable
verily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this ought
show their gratitude to cide hamete its original author for the
scrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minute particulars
not leaving anything however trifling it may be that he does not make
clear and plain he portrays the thoughts he reveals the fancies he
answers implied questions clears up doubts sets objections at rest
and in a word makes plain the smallest points the most inquisitive can
desire to know o renowned author o happy don quixote o famous famous
droll sancho all and each may ye live countless ages for the delight
the history goes on to say that when sancho saw the distressed one faint
he exclaimed i swear by the faith of an honest man and the shades of
all my ancestors the panzas that never i did see or hear of nor has my
master related or conceived in his mind such an adventure as this a
thousand devils not to curse thee take thee malambruno for an
enchanter and a giant couldst thou find no other sort of punishment for
these sinners but bearding them would it not have been better it would
have been better for them to have taken off half their noses from the
middle upwards even though theyd have snuffled when they spoke than to
have put beards on them ill bet they have not the means of paying
that is the truth senor said one of the twelve we have not the
money to get ourselves shaved and so we have some of us taken to using
sticking plasters by way of an economical remedy for by applying them to
our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare and
smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar there are to be sure women in
kandy that go about from house to house to remove down and trim
eyebrows and make cosmetics for the use of the women but we the
duennas of my lady would never let them in for most of them have a
flavour of agents that have ceased to be principals and if we are not
relieved by senor don quixote we shall be carried to our graves with
i will pluck out my own in the land of the moors said don quixote if
at this instant the trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said the
chink of that promise valiant knight reached my ears in the midst of my
swoon and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses
and so once more i implore you illustrious errant indomitable sir to
let your gracious promises be turned into deeds
there shall be no delay on my part said don quixote bethink you
senora of what i must do for my heart is most eager to serve you
the fact is replied the distressed one it is five thousand leagues
a couple more or less from this to the kingdom of kandy if you go by
land but if you go through the air and in a straight line it is three
thousand two hundred and twenty seven you must know too that
malambruno told me that whenever fate provided the knight our deliverer
he himself would send him a steed far better and with less tricks than a
post horse for he will be that same wooden horse on which the valiant
pierres carried off the fair magalona which said horse is guided by a
peg he has in his forehead that serves for a bridle and flies through
the air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devils were
carrying him this horse according to ancient tradition was made by
merlin he lent him to pierres who was a friend of his and who made
long journeys with him and as has been said carried off the fair
magalona bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who
beheld them from the earth gape with astonishment and he never lent him
save to those whom he loved or those who paid him well and since the
great pierres we know of no one having mounted him until now from him
malambruno stole him by his magic art and he has him now in his
possession and makes use of him in his journeys which he constantly
makes through different parts of the world he is here to day to morrow
in france and the next day in potosi and the best of it is the said
horse neither eats nor sleeps nor wears out shoes and goes at an ambling
pace through the air without wings so that he whom he has mounted upon
him can carry a cup full of water in his hand without spilling a drop so
smoothly and easily does he go for which reason the fair magalona
for going smoothly and easily said sancho at this give me my dapple
though he cant go through the air but on the ground ill back him
they all laughed and the distressed one continued and this same horse
if so be that malambruno is disposed to put an end to our sufferings
will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half an hour
for he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby i might
know that i had found the knight i was in quest of would be to send me
the horse wherever he might be speedily and promptly
and how many is there room for on this horse asked sancho
two said the distressed one one in the saddle and the other on the
croup and generally these two are knight and squire when there is no
id like to know senora distressed one said sancho what is the name
his name said the distressed one is not the same as bellerophons
horse that was called pegasus or alexander the greats called
bucephalus or orlando furiosos the name of which was brigliador nor
yet bayard the horse of reinaldos of montalvan nor frontino like
ruggieros nor bootes or peritoa as they say the horses of the sun were
called nor is he called orelia like the horse on which the unfortunate
rodrigo the last king of the goths rode to the battle where he lost his
ill bet said sancho that as they have given him none of these
famous names of well known horses no more have they given him the name
of my masters rocinante which for being apt surpasses all that have
that is true said the bearded countess still it fits him very well
for he is called clavileno the swift which name is in accordance with
his being made of wood with the peg he has in his forehead and with the
swift pace at which he travels and so as far as name goes he may
i have nothing to say against his name said sancho but with what
sort of bridle or halter is he managed
i have said already said the trifaldi that it is with a peg by
turning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makes him
go as he pleases either through the upper air or skimming and almost
sweeping the earth or else in that middle course that is sought and
id like to see him said sancho but to fancy im going to mount him
either in the saddle or on the croup is to ask pears of the elm tree a
good joke indeed i can hardly keep my seat upon dapple and on a
pack saddle softer than silk itself and here theyd have me hold on upon
haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort gad i have no
notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyones beard let each one
shave himself as best he can im not going to accompany my master on any
such long journey besides i cant give any help to the shaving of these
beards as i can to the disenchantment of my lady dulcinea
yes you can my friend replied the trifaldi and so much that
without you so i understand we shall be able to do nothing
in the kings name exclaimed sancho what have squires got to do with
the adventures of their masters are they to have the fame of such as
they go through and we the labour body o me if the historians would
only say such and such a knight finished such and such an adventure
but with the help of so and so his squire without which it would have
been impossible for him to accomplish it but they write curtly don
paralipomenon of the three stars accomplished the adventure of the six
monsters without mentioning such a person as his squire who was there
all the time just as if there was no such being once more sirs i say
my master may go alone and much good may it do him and ill stay here
in the company of my lady the duchess and maybe when he comes back he
will find the lady dulcineas affair ever so much advanced for i mean in
leisure hours and at idle moments to give myself a spell of whipping
without so much as a hair to cover me
for all that you must go if it be necessary my good sancho said the
duchess for they are worthy folk who ask you and the faces of these
ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idle fears
in the kings name once more said sancho if this charitable work
were to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or charity girls
a man might expose himself to some hardships but to bear it for the sake
of stripping beards off duennas devil take it id sooner see them all
bearded from the highest to the lowest and from the most prudish to the
you are very hard on duennas sancho my friend said the duchess you
incline very much to the opinion of the toledo apothecary but indeed you
are wrong there are duennas in my house that may serve as patterns of
duennas and here is my dona rodriguez who will not allow me to say
your excellence may say it if you like said the rodriguez for god
knows the truth of everything and whether we duennas are good or bad
bearded or smooth we are our mothers daughters like other women and as
god sent us into the world he knows why he did and on his mercy i rely
well senora rodriguez senora trifaldi and present company said don
quixote i trust in heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon your
troubles for sancho will do as i bid him only let clavileno come and
let me find myself face to face with malambruno and i am certain no
razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave malambrunos
head off his shoulders for god bears with the wicked but not for
ah exclaimed the distressed one at this may all the stars of the
celestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign eyes valiant
knight and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart that it may
be the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtrodden race of
duennas detested by apothecaries sneered at by squires and made game
of by pages ill betide the jade that in the flower of her youth would
not sooner become a nun than a duenna unfortunate beings that we are we
duennas though we may be descended in the direct male line from hector
of troy himself our mistresses never fail to address us as you if they
think it makes queens of them o giant malambruno though thou art an
enchanter thou art true to thy promises send us now the peerless
clavileno that our misfortune may be brought to an end for if the hot
weather sets in and these beards of ours are still there alas for our
the trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from
the eyes of all and even sanchos filled up and he resolved in his heart
to accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth if so be the
removal of the wool from those venerable countenances depended upon it
of the arrival of clavileno and the end of this protracted adventure
and now night came and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the
famous horse clavileno the non appearance of which was already beginning
to make don quixote uneasy for it struck him that as malambruno was so
long about sending it either he himself was not the knight for whom the
adventure was reserved or else malambruno did not dare to meet him in
single combat but lo suddenly there came into the garden four wild men
all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse
they placed it on its feet on the ground and one of the wild men said
let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine
here sancho exclaimed i dont mount for neither have i the heart nor
and let the squire if he has one continued the wild man take his
seat on the croup and let him trust the valiant malambruno for by no
sword save his nor by the malice of any other shall he be assailed it
is but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck and he will bear them
through the air to where malambruno awaits them but lest the vast
elevation of their course should make them giddy their eyes must be
covered until the horse neighs which will be the sign of their having
with these words leaving clavileno behind them they retired with easy
dignity the way they came as soon as the distressed one saw the horse
almost in tears she exclaimed to don quixote valiant knight the
promise of malambruno has proved trustworthy the horse has come our
beards are growing and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to
shave and shear us as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making
that i will senora countess trifaldi said don quixote most gladly
and with right goodwill without stopping to take a cushion or put on my
spurs so as not to lose time such is my desire to see you and all these
that i wont said sancho with good will or bad will or any way at
all and if this shaving cant be done without my mounting on the croup
my master had better look out for another squire to go with him and
these ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth im no
witch to have a taste for travelling through the air what would my
islanders say when they heard their governor was going strolling about
on the winds and another thing as it is three thousand and odd leagues
from this to kandy if the horse tires or the giant takes huff well be
half a dozen years getting back and there wont be isle or island in the
world that will know me and so as it is a common saying in delay
theres danger and when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter
these ladies beards must excuse me saint peter is very well in rome
i mean i am very well in this house where so much is made of me and i
hope for such a good thing from the master as to see myself a governor
friend sancho said the duke at this the island that i have promised
you is not a moving one or one that will run away it has roots so
deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easy matter
to pluck it up or shift it from where it is you know as well as i do
that there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtained by
a bribe of some kind great or small well then that which i look to
receive for this government is that you go with your master don quixote
and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion and whether you
return on clavileno as quickly as his speed seems to promise or adverse
fortune brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to
hostel and from inn to inn you will always find your island on your
return where you left it and your islanders with the same eagerness they
have always had to receive you as their governor and my good will will
remain the same doubt not the truth of this senor sancho for that
would be grievously wronging my disposition to serve you
say no more senor said sancho i am a poor squire and not equal to
carrying so much courtesy let my master mount bandage my eyes and
commit me to gods care and tell me if i may commend myself to our lord
or call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering up there
to this the trifaldi made answer sancho you may freely commend
yourself to god or whom you will for malambruno though an enchanter is a
christian and works his enchantments with great circumspection taking
very good care not to fall out with anyone
well then said sancho god and the most holy trinity of gaeta give me
since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills said don quixote
i have never seen sancho in such a fright as now were i as
superstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little
trepidation of spirit but come here sancho for with the leave of these
gentles i would say a word or two to thee in private and drawing sancho
aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands he said
thou seest brother sancho the long journey we have before us and god
knows when we shall return or what leisure or opportunities this
business will allow us i wish thee therefore to retire now to thy
chamber as though thou wert going to fetch something required for the
road and in a trice give thyself if it be only five hundred lashes on
account of the three thousand three hundred to which thou art bound it
will be all to the good and to make a beginning with a thing is to have
by god said sancho but your worship must be out of your senses this
is like the common saying you see me with child and you want me a
virgin just as im about to go sitting on a bare board your worship
would have me score my backside indeed your worship is not reasonable
let us be off to shave these duennas and on our return i promise on my
word to make such haste to wipe off all thats due as will satisfy your
well i will comfort myself with that promise my good sancho replied
don quixote and i believe thou wilt keep it for indeed though stupid
im not voracious said sancho only peckish but even if i was a
with this they went back to mount clavileno and as they were about to do
so don quixote said cover thine eyes sancho and mount for one who
sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for the
sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who trust
in him though all should turn out the contrary of what i hope no malice
will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit
let us be off senor said sancho for i have taken the beards and
tears of these ladies deeply to heart and i shant eat a bit to relish
it until i have seen them restored to their former smoothness mount
your worship and blindfold yourself for if i am to go on the croup it
is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first
that is true said don quixote and taking a handkerchief out of his
pocket he begged the distressed one to bandage his eyes very carefully
but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again saying if my
memory does not deceive me i have read in virgil of the palladium of
troy a wooden horse the greeks offered to the goddess pallas which was
big with armed knights who were afterwards the destruction of troy so
it would be as well to see first of all what clavileno has in his
there is no occasion said the distressed one i will be bail for him
and i know that malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him
you may mount without any fear senor don quixote on my head be it if
don quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his
safety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light and so
without more words he mounted clavileno and tried the peg which turned
easily and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down he looked like
nothing so much as a figure in some roman triumph painted or embroidered
much against the grain and very slowly sancho proceeded to mount and
after settling himself as well as he could on the croup found it rather
hard and not at all soft and asked the duke if it would be possible to
oblige him with a pad of some kind or a cushion even if it were off the
couch of his lady the duchess or the bed of one of the pages as the
haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood on this the
trifaldi observed that clavileno would not bear any kind of harness or
trappings and that his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman
as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much
sancho did so and bidding them farewell allowed his eyes to be
bandaged but immediately afterwards uncovered them again and looking
tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden bade them help him in his
present strait with plenty of paternosters and ave marias that god might
provide some one to say as many for them whenever they found themselves
at this don quixote exclaimed art thou on the gallows thief or at thy
last moment to use pitiful entreaties of that sort cowardly spiritless
creature art thou not in the very place the fair magalona occupied and
from which she descended not into the grave but to become queen of
france unless the histories lie and i who am here beside thee may i
not put myself on a par with the valiant pierres who pressed this very
spot that i now press cover thine eyes cover thine eyes abject animal
and let not thy fear escape thy lips at least in my presence
blindfold me said sancho as you wont let me commend myself or be
commended to god is it any wonder if i am afraid there is a region of
devils about here that will carry us off to peralvillo
they were then blindfolded and don quixote finding himself settled to
his satisfaction felt for the peg and the instant he placed his fingers
on it all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices
exclaiming god guide thee valiant knight god be with thee intrepid
squire now now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an arrow now
ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from the earth
take care not to wobble about valiant sancho mind thou fall not for
thy fall will be worse than that rash youths who tried to steer the
as sancho heard the voices clinging tightly to his master and winding
his arms round him he said senor how do they make out we are going up
so high if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking quite
dont mind that sancho said don quixote for as affairs of this
sort and flights like this are out of the common course of things you
can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off but dont
squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me and really i know not what
thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at for i can safely swear i never
mounted a smoother going steed all the days of my life one would fancy
we never stirred from one place banish fear my friend for indeed
everything is going as it ought and we have the wind astern
thats true said sancho for such a strong wind comes against me on
this side that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a thousand
pair of bellows which was the case they were puffing at him with a
great pair of bellows for the whole adventure was so well planned by the
duke the duchess and their majordomo that nothing was omitted to make
don quixote now feeling the blast said beyond a doubt sancho we
must have already reached the second region of the air where the hail
and snow are generated the thunder the lightning and the thunderbolts
are engendered in the third region and if we go on ascending at this
rate we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire and i know not how
to regulate this peg so as not to mount up where we shall be burned
and now they began to warm their faces from a distance with tow that
could be easily set on fire and extinguished again fixed on the end of a
cane on feeling the heat sancho said may i die if we are not already
in that fire place or very near it for a good part of my beard has been
singed and i have a mind senor to uncover and see whereabouts we are
do nothing of the kind said don quixote remember the true story of
the licentiate torralva that the devils carried flying through the air
riding on a stick with his eyes shut who in twelve hours reached rome
and dismounted at torre di nona which is a street of the city and saw
the whole sack and storming and the death of bourbon and was back in
madrid the next morning where he gave an account of all he had seen and
he said moreover that as he was going through the air the devil bade him
open his eyes and he did so and saw himself so near the body of the
moon so it seemed to him that he could have laid hold of it with his
hand and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he should be
seized with giddiness so that sancho it will not do for us to uncover
ourselves for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us and
perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to
descend at one swoop on the kingdom of kandy as the saker or falcon does
on the heron so as to seize it however high it may soar and though it
seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden believe me we must
i dont know how that may be said sancho all i know is that if the
senora magallanes or magalona was satisfied with this croup she could
the duke the duchess and all in the garden were listening to the
conversation of the two heroes and were beyond measure amused by it and
now desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and
well contrived adventure they applied a light to clavilenos tail with
some tow and the horse being full of squibs and crackers immediately
blew up with a prodigious noise and brought don quixote and sancho panza
to the ground half singed by this time the bearded band of duennas the
trifaldi and all had vanished from the garden and those that remained
lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon don quixote and sancho got
up rather shaken and looking about them were filled with amazement at
finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started and
seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground and their
astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived
