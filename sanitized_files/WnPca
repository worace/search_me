prince andrews relations with natasha might if he recovered be
renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
yet in spite of that his relation to her considerate delicate and
loving not only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princess
mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them
allowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that she
loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
beloved and was happy in regard to it
but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
her feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary that
spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
to give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so
strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off as
they looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fall
ill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
journey which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while from
as always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of the
journey itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavl
the thought of what might await her there not after many days but that
very evening again presented itself to her and her agitation increased
the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
rostovs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrew
was when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
by the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him from
i have found out everything your excellency the rostovs are staying
at the merchant bronnikovs house in the square not far from here
princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was her
brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her
his excellency is staying in the same house with them
then he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice
the servants say he is still the same
what still the same might mean princess mary did not ask but with an
unnoticed glance at little seven year old nicholas who was sitting in
front of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head and
did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking and
swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were let
the carriage door was opened on the left there was water a great
river and on the right a porch there were people at the entrance
servants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling as
it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this was
sonya princess mary ran up the steps this way this way said the
girl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself in
the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to
meet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced
mon enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuis
 my child i love you and have known you a long time
despite her excitement princess mary realized that this was the
countess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardly
knowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her and
the doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but as
she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed a
where is he can i see him can i asked the princess
one moment princess one moment my dear is this his son said the
countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles
there will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what a
the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sonya was
talking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy and
the old count came in and welcomed the princess he had changed very
much since princess mary had last seen him then he had been a brisk
cheerful self assured old man now he seemed a pitiful bewildered
person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if
asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the
destruction of moscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomed
groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to
feel that there was no longer a place for him in life
in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible and
her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they
should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew
the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the
necessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things which
she had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it was hard for
her she was not vexed with these people
this is my niece said the count introducing sonya you dont know
princess mary turned to sonya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling
that arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she felt
oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
where is he she asked again addressing them all
he is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing we
have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess
tears of vexation showed themselves in princess marys eyes she turned
away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him when
light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door
the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in almost running
that natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow
but hardly had the princess looked at natashas face before she realized
that here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friend
she ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulder
as soon as natasha sitting at the head of prince andrews bed heard of
princess marys arrival she softly left his room and hastened to her
with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary
there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the
drawing room that of love boundless love for him for her and for all
that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for others
and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it was
plain that at that moment there was in natashas heart no thought of
herself or of her own relations with prince andrew
princess mary with her acute sensibility understood all this at the
first glance at natashas face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful
come come to him mary said natasha leading her into the other
princess mary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to natasha
she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
how she began her question but stopped short
she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words
natashas face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
natasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say
all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes
which penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossible
not to tell the whole truth which she saw and suddenly natashas lips
twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her face
but she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust
but how is his wound what is his general condition
you you will see was all natasha could say
they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off
crying and were able to go to him with calm faces
how has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse when
natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish
condition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed and
the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had also
passed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester
natasha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor had
said that the festering might take a normal course then fever set in
but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious
but two days ago this suddenly happened said natasha struggling with
her sobs i dont know why but you will see what he is like
no its not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good he
when natasha opened prince andrews door with a familiar movement and
let princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt the
sobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and now
tried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look at
the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words two days
ago this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean that he
had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs
of approaching death as she stepped to the door she already saw in
imagination andrews face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle
mild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which therefore
affected her very strongly she was sure he would speak soft tender
words to her such as her father had uttered before his death and that
she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his
presence yet sooner or later it had to be and she went in the sobs
rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly
distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his
features and then she saw his face and met his gaze
he was lying in a squirrel fur dressing gown on a divan surrounded by
pillows he was thin and pale in one thin translucently white hand he
held a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicate
mustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them
on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess marys pace suddenly
slackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly
felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
but in what am i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern look
replied because you are alive and thinking of the living while i
in the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was
an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wont
how are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a voice
had he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horror
into princess marys heart as the tone of his voice
and have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quiet
manner and with an obvious effort to remember
how are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she was
that my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again making
an evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only his
words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts
princess mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince just
perceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she now
understood what had happened to him two days before in his words his
tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could be
felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible
in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand
anything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand not
because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something
else something the living did not and could not understand and which
there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he
breaking the silence and pointing to natasha she looks after me all
princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say that
before her whom he loved and who loved him had he expected to live he
could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone if he had
not known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her and
how could he speak like that in her presence the only explanation was
that he was indifferent because something else much more important
the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off
mary came by way of ryazan said natasha
prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary and only
after calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herself
they told her that all moscow has been burned down and that
natasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was
making an effort to listen but could not do so
yes they say its burned he said its a great pity and he gazed
straight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingers
and so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said
evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he wrote here that he
took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidently
unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for
living people if you liked him too it would be a good thing for you
to get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having
princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except as
a proof of how far away he now was from everything living
why talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natasha
natasha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were again
andrew would you like princess mary suddenly said in a trembling
voice would you like to see little nicholas he is always talking
prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but
princess mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he did
not smile with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentle
irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last
yes i shall be very glad to see him is he quite well
when little nicholas was brought into prince andrews room he looked at
his father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one else
was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to
when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to her
brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer began
mary you know the gosp but he broke off
nothing you mustnt cry here he said looking at her with the same
when princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at
the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with a
great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their
yes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it is
the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father
feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary
but no they will take it their own way they wont understand they
cant understand that all those feelings they prize so all our
feelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary
we cannot understand one another and he remained silent
prince andrews little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew
nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge
observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he
afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound
understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his
father mary and natasha than he had then he understood it
completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up to
natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled
and leaning his head against her he began to cry
after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and
either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natasha of whom
he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly and
when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what
natashas face had told her she did not speak any more to natasha of
hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and
did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that
eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now so
not only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he was
dying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness from
everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence
without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable
eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt
continually all his life was now near to him and by the strange
formerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly
tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that
he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before
him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky and
knew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself after
being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly
unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that
had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about
during the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent
after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new
principle of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciously
detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and
always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to
live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that
principle of love the more he renounced life and the more completely he
destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love
stands between life and death when during those first days he
remembered that he would have to die he said to himself well what of
but after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had seen her
for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to his
lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman again
crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and
joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the
moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin he could not
now regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question
whether kuragin was alive and he dared not inquire
his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natasha
referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two
days before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual struggle
between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the
unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
presented to him in the form of his love for natasha and a last though
ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown
it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and his
thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by the table he
began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him
and so it was in sonyas place sat natasha who had just come in
since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this
physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair
placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was
knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince
andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old
nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the
knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender
rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of
her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees she
started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand
stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball
he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep
breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed
at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told
her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had
brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the
can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and
listened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have brought
me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that the
truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent
my life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but what
am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groaned
on hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking leaned nearer to
him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him
no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one
else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light
natasha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy
natasha i love you too much more than anything in the world
and i she turned away for an instant why too much she asked
why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your
whole soul shall i live what do you think
i am sure of it sure natasha almost shouted taking hold of both his
how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it
natasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would
not do and that he had to be quiet
but you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleep
he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle and
sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked at
him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on her
stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished
soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and
suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration
as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
always occupied his mind about life and death and chiefly about death
love hinders death love is life all everything that i understand i
understand only because i love everything is everything exists only
because i love everything is united by it alone love is god and to
die means that i a particle of love shall return to the general and
eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were
only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they
were too one sidedly personal and brain spun and there was the former
he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that he
was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and
insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and
discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere
prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
more important cares but he continued to speak surprising them by
empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began to
disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all
else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything
depended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and
tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he
was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it
stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the
door that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
against it and forcing its way in something not human death was
breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized the
door making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer
possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from
behind by that terror opened and closed again
once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vain
and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was
but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleep
and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke
yes it was death i died and woke up yes death is an awakening
and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till
then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt
as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and that
when waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natasha went
up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at
that was what had happened to him two days before princess marys
arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever
assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest
natasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more
from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with
his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did
not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both
princess mary and natasha who did not leave him felt this they did
not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that
they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had left
them but on what reminded them most closely of him his body both felt
this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not
affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief
neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever
talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in
they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper
away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that it
he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of
him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the boys
and turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and
natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that
was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he did
what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
when the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leaving
is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes
lain motionless growing cold before them natasha went up looked at
the dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not
kiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his
where has he gone where is he now
when the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table
everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept
little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity
the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was no
more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too
natasha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their own
personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple
and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their
mans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but
the desire to find those causes is implanted in mans soul and without
considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of
which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the
first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says
this is the cause in historical events where the actions of men are
the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation
to present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will of
those who stood in the most prominent position the heroes of history
but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which
lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to
be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to
be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference
between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east
because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
it had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earth
was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew there
were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there
is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws
are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend
the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man
just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
the historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and the
occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the most
important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the russian
army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino camp the
so called flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe the
glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french
acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that
flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and
following them others consider this flank march to be the profound
conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in
the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that
the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow
in 1812 was on the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand by
what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why
they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy
the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or
followed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the
russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian
army really began to improve from the time of that march it does not at
all follow that the march was the cause of it
that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the
russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its
destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if
murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained
inactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as
bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french
attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what
would have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attacked
the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french moved
on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that
the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in
reality like the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyone
in its entirety but resulted moment by moment step by step event by
event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only
seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the
at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a
direct retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the fact
that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all
there is the well known conversation after the council between the
commander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariat
department lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army
supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and
ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be
separated from its supplies by the broad river oka which cannot be
crossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity
of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a
direct retreat on nizhni novgorod the army turned more to the south
along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the
inactivity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army
concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially the
advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn
still further south to the tula road having crossed over by a forced
march to the tula road beyond the pakhra the russian commanders
intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino
position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french
troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects of
giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga
province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross
from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino which was between
the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to
say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say
precisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tarutino only
when the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varying
forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of
the french had ceased the russian army which had been continually
retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct
course and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the
if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the
russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could not
have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing
an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where
that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga roads was
so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction and
demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way
at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the
emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road and the
emperors letter indicated to him the very position he had already
having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
whole campaign and by the battle of borodino the russian army when the
strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received
kutuzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is
called but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
what had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the french
armys inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle of
borodino had been a victory he alone who as commander in chief might
have been expected to be eager to attack employed his whole strength to
the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
left him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and
merely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard
the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed its
calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzovs camp with
napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
right wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him though
monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my adjutants general
to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness
to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the
sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your
person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur le
prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection
kutuzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as
the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of
my nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the
russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had taken
place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in
number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian
side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown
to the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were lauristons
mission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming in
from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow of
recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian
soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been
assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been
resting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight of
was doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
the french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained by
peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this
the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as
the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every
soldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
that the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial change
in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at
once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased
activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres
the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by the
emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow
had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign
had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance though this plan
had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands
it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutuzov
only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution
of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who
were to watch kutuzovs actions and report upon them
besides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized
the posts left vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclay
who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious
consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
put a in bs place and b in ds or on the contrary to put d in as
place and so on as if anything more than as or bs satisfaction
as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen his chief of
staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and
these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was
going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was
undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations
in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct
of the war which all these men believed they were directing but this
affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that
is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the
essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all
these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true
prince michael ilarionovich wrote the emperor on the second of october
in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino since
september 2 moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reports
were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no
action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
capital but according to your last report you have even retreated
farther serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula
with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from
general wintzingerodes reports i see that an enemy corps of ten
thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several
thousand men is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along the
vladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed
between ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the
twenty fifth in view of all this information when the enemy has
scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his
guards in moscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting you
are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the
contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most with
an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem
that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously
attack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to
retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now
occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and other
towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to
direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital
in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the
army entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have
ample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have still
to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow you have
experienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will not weaken
in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal
firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the
courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting
but by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of the
forces had already made itself felt in petersburg was dispatched
kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place
on the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scouting
killed one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare he made
his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murats
army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly
told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french
a cornet hearing the story informed his commander
the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to
take advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of the
superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities
reported the incident to a general on the staff the state of things on
the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to see
bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his
influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the
if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are
asking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do
the cossacks report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was
the final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled spring was
released the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play despite all
his supposed power his intellect his experience and his knowledge of
men kutuzov having taken into consideration the cossacks report a
note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wishes
he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generals
expressed the same wish could no longer check the inevitable movement
and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful gave
his approval that is to the accomplished fact
bennigsens note and the cossacks information that the left flank of
the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
necessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of october
on the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions
toll read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the further
all right all right i havent time just now replied ermolov and
the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitz
dispositions it was written though not in german this time
the first column will march here and here the second column will
march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns
arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy
everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions
and as is always the case not a single column reached its place at the
when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to
deal with a young officer of the horse guards kutuzovs orderly
pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to
the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was
the officer mounting his horse rode off to someone else
if only they dont make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance
