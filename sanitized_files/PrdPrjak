the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there
will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to
settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude
will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to
haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at
longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as
fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope
you will approve she comes to us to day i shall write again as soon as
is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be
wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her
and have you answered the letter cried elizabeth
most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately
consider how important every moment is in such a case
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house
and may i ask  said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little
and they must marry yet he is such a man
yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there
are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me
before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh
it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has
distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued
silent till they reached the house their father then went on to the
library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they
were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be
thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness
and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would
not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children
of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand
if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said
elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has
not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal
protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is
actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now
she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said
jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to
marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of
thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor
i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library
therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly
may we take my uncles letter to read to her
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs
together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication
would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news
the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as
soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soon
married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its
exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter
would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will
be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen
my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage
everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the
clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him
how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell
kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear
lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great
measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but
her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy
in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well
it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in
such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and
you write for me we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and
cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had
not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed
would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the
good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call
on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do
anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you
heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took
refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was
no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in
looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had
feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived
him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that
respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother in law and he
was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly
useless for of course they were to have a son the son was to join
in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters
successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs
bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he
would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then
too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and
the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with
regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother
though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed
that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket
allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was
another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he
naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon
dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick
in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any
the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the
happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant
farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the
good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in
spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object
of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of
accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and
servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering
what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and
haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit it or the
great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is
too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the
impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it
soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend
it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe
possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of
the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters
frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate
there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink the
wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she
hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she
doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in
disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and
temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease
and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved
and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and
precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence
she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets
acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as
his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on
his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into
the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he
promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each
have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have
written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham
in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i
have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin
a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i
hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions
and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment
unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal
from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet
was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the north
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking
to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she
likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the north
received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth
who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and
consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her
and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent
his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as
the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was
surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and
had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to
meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinner time their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she
been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and
she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and
welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile
to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite
so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely
opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was
enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet
was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy
and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their
congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly
round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and
observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners
were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he
claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour
there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near
elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away
it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the
people hereabouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he
should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took
off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that
he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything
elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room
and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with
anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say
to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good
spirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips the lucases and
all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham
by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her
ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast
room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i
am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half
my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get
husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go
very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont
at all like your going such a way off must it be so
oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all
things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we
shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some
balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all
i should like it beyond anything said her mother
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham
had received his commission before he left london and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and
having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to
all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected
to find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring
for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and
if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every
occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every
thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september than any body else in the country
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you
were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were
married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in
that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others
were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in
such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to
put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was
my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in
ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never
be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe
me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a
fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was
rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so
just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once
they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i
did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we
were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he
came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however
i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well
oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious
me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised
them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the
subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least
it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at
her sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people
where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her
brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as
placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper
wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such
a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is
for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems
to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished
the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad
of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it
than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to
be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise
what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your
application i did not expect it from you dont think me angry
however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose to
understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised
as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really
innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several
hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were
and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly
lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day
after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he
called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another
motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days
in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to
direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us
there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago
governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large
house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with
wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and
corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had
she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up
their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the
wished for direction they were in street he saw wickham and
afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he
acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but
he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared
for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear
of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or
other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings
it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which
in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never
been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment
on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and
scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her
own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as
to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he
must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though
mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able
to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief
they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of
course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be
every thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch
street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be
seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was
still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business
on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home
and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all
settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to
longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been
accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and
i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle
was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it
which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where
it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young
people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably
more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all
this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it
was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that
wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth
in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve
can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking
my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who
were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in
london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were
i believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant
admission to the house he was exactly what he had been when i
knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not
perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell
you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she
heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was
sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and
jane and for their sakes had patience with her
mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you
attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave
town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my
dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has
in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his
understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach
him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy
till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little
pair of ponies would be the very thing
but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters
match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the
pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason
with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to
avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for
a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brother in law
of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had
to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had
given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she
could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they
owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him oh
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for
herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it
was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some
pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones
approach and before she could strike into another path she was
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much
for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the
old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of
me but of course she did not mention my name to you
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned
out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely
certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other
several times i wonder what he can be doing there
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said
elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this
undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad
you liked her i hope she will turn out well
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age
did you go by the village of kympton
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a
most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited
exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty
and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to
repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the
quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was
left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the
i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember
what i told you on that point when first we talked of it
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast
to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him
she only said in reply with a good humoured smile
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let
us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though
he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth
by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps
as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for
writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he
smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of
the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to
us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son in law
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with
ones friends one seems so forlorn without them
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said
elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if
that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several
weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs
phillips first brought her the news well so much the better not
that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am
sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome
to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen
but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to
