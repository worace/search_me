in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of
gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions
especially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man he
was very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
perplexity to give or not to give he had asked himself i have it
and he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs it
most and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had been
unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who
asked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in a
similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his
property when one person advised one thing and another something else
now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
perplexity about these questions there was now within him a judge who
by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done
he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he felt
certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he
had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a colonel
came to him and after talking a great deal about his exploits
concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give
him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children pierre
refused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwards
surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so
insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused the colonels
demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when
leaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some money of
which he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of his own
more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
with regard to his wifes debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his
diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to the
to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate
showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but
would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes debts which he
was under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his moscow house
and the country house on his moscow estate which had cost him eighty
thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing
yes of course thats true said pierre with a cheerful smile i
dont need all that at all by being ruined i have become much richer
but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the
state of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of this
as of a settled matter about the same time he received letters from
prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifes
debts and pierre decided that the stewards proposals which had so
pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his
wifes affairs and must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did
not know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his income
would be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be done
willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together
during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had
experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during his
journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
faces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like
a schoolboy on holiday everyone the stagecoach driver the post house
overseers the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new
significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who
continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its
backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres pleasure
where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and
vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows
maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people he
did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an
apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that
could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him
it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has
been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of
rubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why they
jostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equally
difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the
french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when we
watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy and
immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction
of the heap something indestructible which though intangible is the
real strength of the colony still exists and similarly though in
moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches
shrines riches or houses it was still the moscow it had been in
august all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful and
the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had
been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at first
for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had in
common a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow to
within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in a
fortnight twenty five thousand and so on by the autumn of 1813 the
number ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been in
the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerodes
detachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who had
fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the russians who
entered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn they
continued what the french had begun trains of peasant carts came to
moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the
ruined houses and the streets the cossacks carried off what they could
to their camps and the householders seized all they could find in other
houses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their property
but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
contingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more
the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
regular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship with
luxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms were
lifeless but still existed there were bazaars shops warehouses
market stalls granaries for the most part still stocked with goods
and there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy houses
filled with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churches
and cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms of
town life perished until finally all was merged into one confused
the more the plundering by the french continued the more both the
wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but
plundering by the russians with which the reoccupation of the city
began had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greater
the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
of the city and its regular life restored
besides the plunderers very various people some drawn by curiosity
some by official duties some by self interest house owners clergy
officials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasants streamed into
within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out
of the town other peasants having heard of their comrades
discomfiture came to town bringing rye oats and hay and beat down
one anothers prices to below what they had been in former days gangs
of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day and on
all sides logs were being hewn new houses built and old charred ones
repaired tradesmen began trading in booths cookshops and taverns were
opened in partially burned houses the clergy resumed the services in
many churches that had not been burned donors contributed church
property that had been stolen government clerks set up their baize
covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms the
higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods
left behind by the french the owners of houses in which much property
had been left brought there from other houses complained of the
injustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlin
others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different
houses into this or that house it would be unfair to allow its owner to
keep all that was found there they abused the police and bribed them
made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
had perished in the fire and demanded relief and count rostopchin
at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of
his house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin and
on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leave
for petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victory
everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city
everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and
everyone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly
well disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guard
for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to him
whether important or quite trifling such as where would he live was
he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mind
taking a parcel for someone he replied yes perhaps or i think
he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of
natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant
memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social
obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had
on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that
princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days of
prince andrew had often occupied pierres thoughts and now recurred to
him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary was
in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in
vozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see her
on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their
friendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the last
is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in
is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before
he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death and
involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet so
similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood
the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but its
general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with a
stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of
the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house
informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and that
announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre
yes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallery
a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought
word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he
would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment
in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess
always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he
never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he
thought glancing at the lady in the black dress
the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand
yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
hand so this is how we meet again he spoke of you even at the very
last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a
i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good
news we had received for a long time
again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre
just imagine i knew nothing about him said he i thought he had
been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know
that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence
pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the
companions face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and
as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion
in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not
but when he mentioned the rostovs princess marys face expressed still
greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from pierres face to
that of the lady in the black dress and said
pierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with its
black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten
and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes
but no it cant be he thought this stern thin pale face that
looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but
at that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty
effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from
that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with
a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been
thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him and
enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible
at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess mary
and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware
he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide his
agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer
than any words could have done did he betray to himself to her and to
no its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon as
he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he
again glanced at natasha and a still deeper flush suffused his face and
a still stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he
became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to
see her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change in
her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale but
that was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the
moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
a suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered and
glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyes
pierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natashas part
but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face
she has come to stay with me said princess mary the count and
countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful
state but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor they
yes is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre addressing
natasha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw him
natasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes
what can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre nothing
why had such a splendid boy so full of life to die
yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarked
yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her
why is it true natasha asked looking attentively into pierres eyes
how can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of what
natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked
and because pierre continued only one who believes that there is a
god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yours
natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped
pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary
pierres confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he felt
that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was now a
judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him
than that of all the rest of the world as he spoke now he was
considering what impression his words would make on natasha he did not
purposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying he
princess mary reluctantly as is usual in such cases began telling of
the condition in which she had found prince andrew but pierres face
quivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expression
gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
his whole body and eagerly listened to her story yes yes so he
grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always sought one
thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of death the
faults he had if he had any were not of his making so he did
soften what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenly
turning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears
natashas face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment
she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not
yes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with its
deep chest notes for me it certainly was happiness she paused and
he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered
natashas voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on her
knees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her
we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare to
ask about him then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us i
had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted was
to see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quickly
and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
never yet mentioned to anyone all she had lived through during those
three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl
pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
tears as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of death
nor of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only pity for
her for what she was suffering now while she was speaking
princess mary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat beside
natasha and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale
she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
her soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times she
dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
nicholas might come in to say good night
she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the door
which was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushed
from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow
pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world
princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention
to her nephew who had entered the room
at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which
resembled his fathers affected pierre so much that when he had kissed
the boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the
window he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not let
no natasha and i sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so please
dont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately
before pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the first
time she has talked of him like that
pierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minutes
later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha natasha
was calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
face they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it is
impossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles is
awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
affectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back the
chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
and resolving to break the silence looked at natasha and at princess
mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of
both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life
do you take vodka count asked princess mary and those words
suddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourself
said she one hears such improbable wonders about you
yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him
they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovna
invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or ought
to have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought
to tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is very
easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now people
invite me out and tell me all about myself
natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking
we have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost two
but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre
though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifes
debts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he had
what i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but did
not continue noticing that this theme was too egotistic
tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to
remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing
that her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to his
words a meaning he had perhaps not intended
no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning
princess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orel and you
cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he
added quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as
to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terribly
when two people quarrel they are always both in fault and ones own
guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer
alive and then such a death without friends and without consolation
i am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to notice
a look of glad approval on natashas face
yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess
pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at
natasha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold
and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told
no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
means being napoleons guest not only did i never see him but i heard
nothing about him i was in much lower company
supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his
captivity was gradually led on to do so
but its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natasha
asked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at the
pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by
princess marys questions and especially by natashas into giving a
at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him
toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came to
describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
emotion of a man re experiencing in recollection strong impressions he
princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at
natasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness
natasha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantly
changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never
wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described not only
her look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showed
pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear
that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to
but could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incident
with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
this it was an awful sight children abandoned some in the flames
one was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who had
their things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed and
grew confused then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who
were not looting that is were arrested and i among them
i am sure youre not telling us everything i am sure you did
something said natasha and pausing added something fine
pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over
the horrible details but natasha insisted that he should not omit
pierre began to tell about karataev but paused by this time he had
risen from the table and was pacing the room natasha following him with
no you cant understand what i learned from that illiterate man that
yes yes go on said natasha where is he
and pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the last
days of their retreat of karataevs illness and his death
he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now as
it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he was
telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has
when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try
to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity
offers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their
own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their
little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with
a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself
natasha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a word
no single quiver in pierres voice no look no twitch of a muscle in
his face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its
flight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secret
princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she now
saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the
possibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre and the
first thought of this filled her heart with gladness
it was three oclock in the morning the footmen came in with sad and
stern faces to change the candles but no one noticed them
pierre finished his story natasha continued to look at him intently
with bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understand
something more which he had perhaps left untold pierre in shamefaced
and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think what
to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent it
occurred to none of them that it was three oclock and time to go to
people speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but if
at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were before
you were taken prisoner or go through all this again then for
heavens sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh we imagine
that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it is
only then that what is new and good begins while there is life there is
happiness there is much much before us i say this to you he added
yes yes she said answering something quite different i too should
wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning
its not true not true cried pierre i am not to blame for being
alive and wishing to live nor you either
suddenly natasha bent her head covered her face with her hands and
nothing nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears good night
princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked of
what pierre had told them princess mary did not express her opinion of
well good night mary said natasha do you know i am often afraid
that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for fear of not
doing justice to our feelings we forget him
princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
natashas remark but she did not express agreement in words
it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard and
painful but good very good said natasha i am sure he really loved
him that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenly
to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said princess
do you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time he has
somehow grown so clean smooth and fresh as if he had just come out of
a russian bath do you understand out of a moral bath isnt it true
yes replied princess mary he has greatly improved
with a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if he
had come straight from the bath papa used to
i understand why he prince andrew liked no one so much as him
yes and yet he is quite different they say men are friends when they
are quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike him
and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he paced
up and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem
and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and now
he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love at one
moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feeling
it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the
well whats to be done if it cannot be avoided whats to be done
evidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing
he got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
strange and impossible as such happiness seems i must do everything
that she and i may be man and wife he told himself
a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the
friday when he awoke on the thursday savelich came to ask him about
what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg
he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago
before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg he
reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is and
how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at
savelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he has
well savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre
whats the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the
late count the kingdom of heaven be his and we have lived under you
the children will live just the same with such masters one can live
but what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marry
it might happen he added with an involuntary smile
if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing
how easy he thinks it thought pierre he doesnt know how terrible
it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible
so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelich
no ill put it off for a bit ill tell you later you must forgive
the trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savelich smile
he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that now
there is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first of
all but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shall
i have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected no
at breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been to
see princess mary the day before and had there met whom do you think
the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he
i have seen the princess she replied i heard that they were
arranging a match for her with young rostov it would be a very good
thing for the rostovs they are said to be utterly ruined
no i mean do you know natasha rostova
i heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pity
no she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought pierre
the princess too had prepared provisions for pierres journey
how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that
they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
on the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to send
a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be
and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chief
of police what a fine good looking officer and how kind fancy
bothering about such trifles now and they actually say he is not honest
and takes bribes what nonsense besides why shouldnt he take bribes
thats the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a
kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me
as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
down he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesqueness
of the chimney stacks and tumble down walls of the burned out quarters
of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of
the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the
carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the women
hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming
eyes that seemed to say ah there he is lets see what will come of
at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful whether he
had really been there the night before and really seen natasha and
talked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find no
one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom she
was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the
same way as the day before yet she was quite different had she been
like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have
she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince
andrews fiancee a bright questioning light shone in her eyes and on
her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression
pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there but
princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her
next day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening though
princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
though all pierres interest was now centered in that house by the
evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off he stayed so long
that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wondering
when he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasy
and embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
princess mary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining of
so you are going to petersburg tomorrow she asked
no i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and as
though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrow but i wont say
good by yet i will call round in case you have any commissions for me
said he standing before princess mary and turning red but not taking
natasha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other hand
instead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly and
intently at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she had
plainly shown before had now quite passed off with a deep and long
drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk
when natasha left the room pierres confusion and awkwardness
immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly
yes i wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she had
spoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess my
dear friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of her i
know its impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a brother to
her no not that i dont i cant
he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands
well he went on with an evident effort at self control and coherence
i dont know when i began to love her but i have loved her and her
alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without
her i cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhaps
she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that
possibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hope
tell me what i am to do dear princess he added after a pause and
touched her hand as she did not reply
i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary this
is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love at
princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love was
impossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in
natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre
spoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished for
to speak to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the same
leave it to me said princess mary i know
i know that she loves will love you princess mary corrected
before her words were out pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
what makes you think so you think i may hope you think
yes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to her
parents and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it to
happen and my heart tells me it will
no it cannot be how happy i am but it cant be how happy i am
no it cant be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess marys hands
go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she
to petersburg go there very well ill go but i may come again
next day pierre came to say good by natasha was less animated than she
had been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierre
sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possible
no it cant be he told himself at every look gesture and word that
when on saying good by he took her thin slender hand he could not help
holding it a little longer in his own
is it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasure
of feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will one
day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no thats
good bye count she said aloud i shall look forward very much to
and these simple words her look and the expression on her face which
accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
memories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall
look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it
yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i
am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself
there was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled it
he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words
he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever made
me say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imagination
every word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of
her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything but
only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt
in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong
only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind wasnt it all a
dream isnt princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and self
confident i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her
and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deluding
himself doesnt he know that he is a man just a man while i i am
that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make any
plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only
he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended
a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable
possessed him the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the
whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of
being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
one thing only his future happiness sometimes it seemed to him that
other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to
hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in
every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he often
surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when
he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitied
them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them
that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of
when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service or
when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
assumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue of
events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise
people by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybody both
those who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is
what he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did not
understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within
himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
everything that was good and worthy of being loved
when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memory
aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he
now knew prince vasili who having obtained a new post and some fresh
decorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him a
pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied
often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all
the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true
for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when
he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had
held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct
i may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was not
so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had more
insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth
understanding in life because because i was happy
pierres insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to
discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people
before loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and by
loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving
after pierres departure that first evening when natasha had said to
princess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just as
if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with his hair
cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressible
everything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered to
her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
surface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to have
