kriegs wurst raths are suvorov couldnt manage them so what chance has
michael kutuzov no my dear boy he continued you and your generals
wont get on against buonaparte youll have to call in the french so
that birds of a feather may fight together the german pahlen has been
sent to new york in america to fetch the frenchman moreau he said
alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian
service wonderful were the potemkins suvorovs and orlovs
germans no lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or i have
outlived mine may god help you but well see what will happen
buonaparte has become a great commander among them hm
i dont at all say that all the plans are good said prince andrew i
am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as
you like but all the same bonaparte is a great general
michael ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy
with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten didnt i tell you
buonaparte was a great tactician here he says the same thing
to be sure your excellency replied the architect
buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has got
splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and only
idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody
has beaten the germans they beat no one except one another he made
and the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to
him bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his son
made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were
presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion he
listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this
old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and
discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and
you think im an old man and dont understand the present state of
affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i dont sleep at
night come now where has this great commander of yours shown his
that would take too long to tell answered the son
well then go to your buonaparte mademoiselle bourienne heres
another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours he exclaimed in
you know prince i am not a bonapartist
dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a
laugh still more so he quitted the table
the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the
dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her father in
law and now at princess mary when they left the table she took her
sister in laws arm and drew her into another room
what a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why i am
oh he is so kind answered princess mary
prince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not altering
his routine retired as usual after dinner the little princess was in
her sister in laws room prince andrew in a traveling coat without
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him
after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he
ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept
with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with
silver plate two turkish pistols and a saber a present from his father
who had brought it from the siege of ochakov all these traveling
effects of prince andrews were in very good order new clean and in
when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments
one reviews the past and plans for the future prince andrews face
looked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he paced
briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him
and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or was
he sad at leaving his wife perhaps both but evidently he did not wish
to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he
hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover
of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
expression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard
i hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had
apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk with
you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry
with me for coming you have changed so andrusha she added as if to
she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrusha it was obviously
strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrusha
the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood
and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a smile
she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room oh
andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on
the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a dear merry
child i have grown so fond of her
prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face
one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them
andrew dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in society
and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into
everyones situation tout comprendre cest tout pardonner  think
what it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to
be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country in her
prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we
you live in the country and dont think the life terrible he replied
i thats different why speak of me i dont want any other life
and cant for i know no other but think andrew for a young society
woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all
alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what poor
resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society
i dont like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince andrew
no she is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be pitied
she has no one no one to tell the truth i dont need her and shes
even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even more so
i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael
ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind
because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says we dont
love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we
have done them father took her when she was homeless after losing her
own father she is very good natured and my father likes her way of
reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly
to be quite frank mary i expect fathers character sometimes makes
things trying for you doesnt it prince andrew asked suddenly
princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question
for me for me trying for me said she
he always was rather harsh and now i should think hes getting very
trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father
in order to puzzle or test his sister
you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of intellectual
pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts
rather than the trend of the conversation and thats a great sin how
can one judge father but even if one might what feeling except
veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contented
and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i am
the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth
andrew is fathers way of treating religious subjects i dont
understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as
clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing that
makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of
improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a
monk he received and had a long talk with
ah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder
ah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me andrew
she said timidly after a moments silence i have a great favor to ask
no promise that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble and
is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise
andrusha said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
taking out what she was holding inside it as if what she held were the
subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew as
think what you please i know you are just like father think as you
please but do this for my sake please do fathers father our
grandfather wore it in all his wars she still did not take out what
she was holding in her reticule so you promise
andrew i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
if it does not weigh a hundredweight and wont break my neck to
please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing the pained
expression his joke had brought to his sisters face he repented and
added i am glad really dear i am very glad
against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to
himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice
trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her
brother a small oval antique dark faced icon of the saviour in a gold
she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew
rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those eyes lit up
the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful her brother
would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood
crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for
he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face
thank you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again
on the sofa they were silent for a while
as i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always used
to be dont judge lise harshly she began she is so sweet so good
natured and her position now is a very hard one
i do not think i have complained of my wife to you masha or blamed
her why do you say all this to me
red patches appeared on princess marys face and she was silent as if
i have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and i
the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks she tried to
say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little
princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her
fate her father in law and her husband after crying she had fallen
asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister
know this masha i cant reproach have not reproached and never
shall reproach my wife with anything and i cannot reproach myself with
anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever
circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth if
you want to know whether i am happy no is she happy no but why this
as he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her
forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and
unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over
her head toward the darkness of the open doorway
let us go to her i must say good by or go and wake and ill come in
a moment petrushka he called to his valet come here take these
away put this on the seat and this to the right
princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said
andrew if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to
give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been
well may be said prince andrew go masha ill come immediately
on the way to his sisters room in the passage which connected one wing
with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling
sweetly it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and
artless smile she had met him in secluded passages
oh i thought you were in your room she said for some reason
prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the
frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word when he reached his
sisters room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying
one word after another came through the open door she was speaking as
usual in french and as if after long self restraint she wished to make
no but imagine the old countess zubova with false curls and her mouth
full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age ha ha
this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh prince
andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and
rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking
incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases prince
andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after
their journey she answered him and continued her chatter
the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn
night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid good by to the
young prince the members of the household were all gathered in the
mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his
fathers study as the latter wished to say good by to him alone all
when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his old age
spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his
son sat at the table writing he glanced round
kiss me here and he touched his cheek thanks thanks
for not dilly dallying and not hanging to a womans apron strings the
service before everything thanks thanks and he went on writing so
that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have anything to say
say it these two things can be done together he added
about my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands
when her confinement is due send to moscow for an accoucheur let
the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his
i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said
prince andrew evidently confused i know that out of a million cases
only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been
telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened
hm hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was
he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
the wife said the old prince briefly and significantly
no it cant be helped lad said the prince theyre all like that
one cant unmarry dont be afraid i wont tell anyone but you know it
he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked
straight into his sons face with keen eyes which seemed to see through
the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him the
old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing
down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity
whats to be done shes pretty i will do everything make your mind
easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter
andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father
understood him the old man got up and gave the letter to his son
listen said he dont worry about your wife what can be done shall
be now listen give this letter to michael ilarionovich  i have
written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you
long as an adjutant a bad position tell him i remember and like him
write and tell me how he receives you if he is all right serve him
nicholas bolkonskis son need not serve under anyone if he is in
he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son
was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised the
lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his
i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs
hand them to the emperor after my death now here is a lombard bond and
a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of suvorovs
wars send it to the academy here are some jottings for you to read
when i am gone you will find them useful
andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
yet he felt that he must not say it
i will do it all father he said
well now good by he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced
him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt me
your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous
voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like a
son of nicholas bolkonski i shall be ashamed
you need not have said that to me father said the son with a smile
i also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew if im killed and
if i have a son do not let him be taken away from you as i said
yesterday let him grow up with you please
not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed
they stood silent facing one another the old mans sharp eyes were
fixed straight on his sons something twitched in the lower part of the
weve said good by go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice
what is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at
the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing
gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice
and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now go
andrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking
he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder
he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face
and carefully placed her in an easy chair
adieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and
kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps
the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafing
her temples princess mary supporting her sister in law still looked
with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince
andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction from
the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man
angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
gone thats all right said he and looking angrily at the
unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
in october 1805 a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the
inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of
on october 11 1805 one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by
the commander in chief despite the un russian appearance of the
locality and surroundings fruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and
hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants who
gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regiment
had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an
on the evening of the last days march an order had been received that
the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is
always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiers
after a twenty mile march were kept mending and cleaning all night long
without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders
calculated and reckoned and by morning the regiment instead of the
straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day
before presented a well ordered array of two thousand men each of whom
knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place
and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order
but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he
would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the
appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say
there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at
ease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the mens
boots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the
regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched
the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and
thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from
chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brand new uniform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he
had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander
admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was
engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military
matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
well michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion
commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both
felt happy we had our hands full last night however i think the
the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed
it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow
at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been
posted two men appeared on horse back they were an aide de camp
the aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief
wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the
march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation
a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day
before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering this
junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view
to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment
so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander
in chief would be though the aide de camp did not know these
circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men
should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the
commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture
a fine mess weve made of it he remarked
there now didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said on
the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the
battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutely
forward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked the
aide de camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the
soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off
to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats
were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up
to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing
up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
in half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray
instead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance
whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of the
commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to
the general third company to the commander the words passed along
the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer
when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a
cry of the general to the third company the missing officer appeared
from behind his company and though he was a middle aged man and not in
the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the
general the captains face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is
told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on his nose
the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouth
twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as he
came up panting slackening his pace as he approached
you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is this
shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after the
commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh ill teach
you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh
the commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this
well why dont you speak whom have you got there dressed up as a
hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe
well your excellency what your excellency but what about your
your excellency its the officer dolokhov who has been reduced to the
well has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier if
a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others
your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march
gave him leave leave thats just like you young men said the
regimental commander cooling down a little leave indeed one says a
word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i beg
and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky
steps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display of
anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another
because his line was not straight he reached the third company
h o o w are you standing wheres your leg your leg shouted the
commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were still
five men between him and dolokhov with his bluish gray uniform
dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his
why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the
general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure dolokhov
no talking in the ranks no talking no talking
not bound to endure insults dolokhov concluded in loud ringing
the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent
i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he
hes coming shouted the signaler at that moment
the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup
with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself
drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his
mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird
att ention shouted the regimental commander in a soul shaking voice
which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome
along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high
light blue viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
by six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped the suite and
a convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian general in a white
uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the caleche
stopped in front of the regiment kutuzov and the austrian general were
talking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he
stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men
breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist
the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a
jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble
voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roared health
to your ex len len lency and again all became silent at
first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the
general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks
from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from
the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he
darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief it
was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and
assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that
had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there
were only 217 sick and stragglers everything was in good order except
kutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few
friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes
also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his
head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help
noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran
forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the
commander in chiefs regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at a
distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed
some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves
and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a
handsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was his comrade
nesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly
smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from
laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him
this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the
expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders back
and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and
bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same
manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the
kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the third
company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this
ah timokhin said he recognizing the red nosed captain who had been
one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more
than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
it had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kutuzov
who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good
quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied
and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
officer as in a looking glass started moved forward and answered
we all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking away from
him he used to have a predilection for bacchus
the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed
captain and his drawn in stomach and mimicked his expression and pose
with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzov
turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face
and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
the third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently trying
to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the
you told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov reduced to the ranks
dolokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat did
not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fair haired soldier
with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the
have you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frown
ah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty
the emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deserve well
the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as
they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression
to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief
one thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firm
ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia
kutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned
from captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a
grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and
everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of
it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the
the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed
quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
you wont bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimental
commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and
riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimental
commanders face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with
irrepressible delight its in the emperors service it cant be
helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first to
apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out his
dont mention it general as if id be so bold replied the captain
his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front
teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at
and tell mr dolokhov that i wont forget him he may be quite easy
and tell me please ive been meaning to ask how is he behaving
as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency
and what about his character asked the regimental commander
its different on different days answered the captain one day he is
sensible well educated and good natured and the next hes a wild
beast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jew
oh well well remarked the regimental commander still one must
have pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important
i will your excellency said timokhin showing by his smile that he
the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and reining
dolokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking
well thats all right continued the regimental commander a cup of
vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear i
thank you all god be praised and he rode past that company and
well hes really a good fellow one can serve under him said
in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the
the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could be
and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye
no friend he is sharper eyed than you are boots and leg bands he
when he looked at my feet friend well thinks i
and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared
with chalk as white as flour i suppose they polish him up as they do
i say fedeshon did he say when the battles are to begin you were

and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemed
to be poles all under the russian crown but here theyre all regular
singers to the front came the captains order
and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a
drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing
his arm began a long drawn out soldiers song commencing with the
words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on then
brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had been
composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only
change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father
having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as

soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes
then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised
both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object
above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it

wild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private
and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov had spoken
to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old
