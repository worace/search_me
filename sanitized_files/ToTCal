watching them in such quiet as the night knew
lucie had by that time fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet
clinging to his hand miss pross had laid the child down on his own
bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge o the long long night with the moans of the poor wife and o
the long long night with no return of her father and no tidings
twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded and the
irruption was repeated and the grindstone whirled and spluttered
what is it cried lucie affrighted hush the soldiers swords are
sharpened there said mr lorry the place is national property now
and used as a kind of armoury my love
twice more in all but the last spell of work was feeble and fitful
soon afterwards the day began to dawn and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand and cautiously looked out again a man so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone and looking about him with a vacant air
shortly this worn out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of monseigneur and staggering to that gorgeous vehicle
climbed in at the door and shut himself up to take his rest on its
the great grindstone earth had turned when mr lorry looked out again
and the sun was red on the courtyard but the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air with a red upon it that the sun had
one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr
lorry when business hours came round was this that he had no right to
imperil tellsons by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the bank roof his own possessions safety life he would have hazarded
for lucie and her child without a moments demur but the great trust
he held was not his own and as to that business charge he was a strict
at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of finding out
the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city but the
same consideration that suggested him repudiated him he lived in the
most violent quarter and doubtless was influential there and deep in
noon coming and the doctor not returning and every minutes delay
tending to compromise tellsons mr lorry advised with lucie she said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term in that
quarter near the banking house as there was no business objection to
this and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles and
he were to be released he could not hope to leave the city mr lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging and found a suitable one high up
in a removed by street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes
to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child and miss pross
giving them what comfort he could and much more than he had himself
he left jerry with them as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head and retained to his own occupations
a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him
it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closed he
was again alone in his room of the previous night considering what to
do next when he heard a foot upon the stair in a few moments a
man stood in his presence who with a keenly observant look at him
your servant said mr lorry do you know me
he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair from forty five
to fifty years of age for answer he repeated without any change of
much interested and agitated mr lorry said you come from doctor
and what says he what does he send me
defarge gave into his anxious hand an open scrap of paper it bore the
charles is safe but i cannot safely leave this place yet
i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
from charles to his wife let the bearer see his wife
it was dated from la force within an hour
will you accompany me said mr lorry joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud to where his wife resides
scarcely noticing as yet in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way defarge spoke mr lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard there they found two women one knitting
madame defarge surely said mr lorry who had left her in exactly
does madame go with us inquired mr lorry seeing that she moved as
yes that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons
beginning to be struck by defarges manner mr lorry looked dubiously
at him and led the way both the women followed the second woman being
they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might
ascended the staircase of the new domicile were admitted by jerry
and found lucie weeping alone she was thrown into a transport by the
tidings mr lorry gave her of her husband and clasped the hand that
delivered his note little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night and might but for a chance have done to him
dearest take courage i am well and your father has
that was all the writing it was so much however to her who received
it that she turned from defarge to his wife and kissed one of the
hands that knitted it was a passionate loving thankful womanly
action but the hand made no response dropped cold and heavy and took
there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check she stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom and with her hands yet at her
neck looked terrified at madame defarge madame defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold impassive stare
my dear said mr lorry striking in to explain there are frequent
risings in the streets and although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times to the end that she may know them that she
may identify them i believe said mr lorry rather halting in his
reassuring words as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more i state the case citizen defarge
defarge looked gloomily at his wife and gave no other answer than a
you had better lucie said mr lorry doing all he could to
propitiate by tone and manner have the dear child here and our
good pross our good pross defarge is an english lady and knows no
the lady in question whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner was not to be shaken by distress and danger
appeared with folded arms and observed in english to the vengeance
whom her eyes first encountered well i am sure boldface i hope
you are pretty well she also bestowed a british cough on madame
defarge but neither of the two took much heed of her
is that his child said madame defarge stopping in her work for the
first time and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it
yes madame answered mr lorry this is our poor prisoners darling
the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her and held her to her breast the
shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall
threatening and dark on both the mother and the child
it is enough my husband said madame defarge i have seen them we
but the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it not visible and
presented but indistinct and withheld to alarm lucie into saying as
she laid her appealing hand on madame defarges dress
you will be good to my poor husband you will do him no harm you will
help me to see him if you can
your husband is not my business here returned madame defarge looking
down at her with perfect composure it is the daughter of your father
for my sake then be merciful to my husband for my childs sake she
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful we are more
madame defarge received it as a compliment and looked at her husband
defarge who had been uneasily biting his thumb nail and looking at her
what is it that your husband says in that little letter asked madame
defarge with a lowering smile influence he says something touching
that my father said lucie hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it has
surely it will release him said madame defarge let it do so
as a wife and mother cried lucie most earnestly i implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess against
my innocent husband but to use it in his behalf o sister woman think
madame defarge looked coldly as ever at the suppliant and said
the wives and mothers we have been used to see since we were as little
as this child and much less have not been greatly considered we have
known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them
often enough all our lives we have seen our sister women suffer in
themselves and in their children poverty nakedness hunger thirst
sickness misery oppression and neglect of all kinds
we have seen nothing else returned the vengeance
we have borne this a long time said madame defarge turning her eyes
again upon lucie judge you is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now
she resumed her knitting and went out the vengeance followed defarge
courage my dear lucie said mr lorry as he raised her courage
courage so far all goes well with us much much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls cheer up and have a thankful heart
i am not thankless i hope but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes
tut tut said mr lorry what is this despondency in the brave
little breast a shadow indeed no substance in it lucie
but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself
for all that and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly
doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her that
not until long afterwards when france and she were far apart did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain she only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons that all political prisoners had been in danger and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered
to mr lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of la force that in the prison he had
found a self appointed tribunal sitting before which the prisoners were
brought singly and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred or to be released or in a few cases to be sent back
to their cells that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille that one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this
that hereupon he had ascertained through the registers on the table
that his son in law was among the living prisoners and had pleaded hard
to the tribunal of whom some members were asleep and some awake some
dirty with murder and some clean some sober and some not for his life
and liberty that in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court and
examined that he seemed on the point of being at once released when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible
to the doctor which led to a few words of secret conference that
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody but should for his sake be held
inviolate in safe custody that immediately on a signal the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again but that he the
doctor had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son in law was through no malice or mischance
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings that he had obtained the permission and
had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over
the sights he had seen there with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals shall remain untold the mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces one prisoner there was he said who had
been discharged into the street free but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out being besought to go to him and dress
the wound the doctor had passed out at the same gate and had found him
in the arms of a company of samaritans who were seated on the bodies
of their victims with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare they had helped the healer and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands and swooned away in the midst of it
as mr lorry received these confidences and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixty two years of age a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger
but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he had never
at all known him in his present character for the first time the doctor
felt now that his suffering was strength and power for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughters husband and deliver him
it all tended to a good end my friend it was not mere waste and ruin
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself i will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her by the aid
of heaven i will do it thus doctor manette and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes the resolute face the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped like a
clock for so many years and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed
greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with would
have yielded before his persevering purpose while he kept himself
in his place as a physician whose business was with all degrees
of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good he used his
personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons and among them of la force he could now assure lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners he saw her husband weekly and brought sweet
messages to her straight from his lips sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her though never by the doctors hand but she was
not permitted to write to him for among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad
this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubt still the
sagacious mr lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride it was a natural and worthy one
but he observed it as a curiosity the doctor knew that up to that
time his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness
now that this was changed and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charless
ultimate safety and deliverance he became so far exalted by the change
that he took the lead and direction and required them as the weak to
trust to him as the strong the preceding relative positions of himself
and lucie were reversed yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him all
curious to see thought mr lorry in his amiably shrewd way but all
natural and right so take the lead my dear friend and keep it it
but though the doctor tried hard and never ceased trying to get
charles darnay set at liberty or at least to get him brought to trial
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him the new
era began the king was tried doomed and beheaded the republic of
liberty equality fraternity or death declared for victory or death
against the world in arms the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of notre dame three hundred thousand men summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth rose from all the varying soils
of france as if the dragons teeth had been sown broadcast and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain on rock in gravel and
alluvial mud under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of
the north in fell and forest in the vineyards and the olive grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers and in the sand of the sea shore
what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year
one of liberty the deluge rising from below not falling from above
and with the windows of heaven shut not opened
there was no pause no pity no peace no interval of relenting rest no
measurement of time though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young and the evening and morning were the first day other
count of time there was none hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation as it is in the fever of one patient now breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city the executioner showed the people the
head of the king and now it seemed almost in the same breath the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
and yet observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases the time was long while it flamed by so fast a
revolutionary tribunal in the capital and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land a law of the suspected
which struck away all security for liberty or life and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence and could obtain no hearing
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old
above all one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world the figure of the
it was the popular theme for jests it was the best cure for headache
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion it was the national razor which
shaved close who kissed la guillotine looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack it was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race it superseded the cross models of it were worn on breasts
from which the cross was discarded and it was bowed down to and
it sheared off heads so many that it and the ground it most polluted
were a rotten red it was taken to pieces like a toy puzzle for a young
devil and was put together again when the occasion wanted it it hushed
the eloquent struck down the powerful abolished the beautiful and
good twenty two friends of high public mark twenty one living and one
dead it had lopped the heads off in one morning in as many minutes
the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it but so armed he was stronger than his
namesake and blinder and tore away the gates of gods own temple every
among these terrors and the brood belonging to them the doctor walked
with a steady head confident in his power cautiously persistent in his
end never doubting that he would save lucies husband at last yet the
current of the time swept by so strong and deep and carried the time
away so fiercely that charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the doctor was thus steady and confident so much more
wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month
that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun still the doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head no man better known than he in paris at
that day no man in a stranger situation silent humane indispensable
in hospital and prison using his art equally among assassins and
victims he was a man apart in the exercise of his skill the
appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all
other men he was not suspected or brought in question any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before or were
one year and three months during all that time lucie was never
sure from hour to hour but that the guillotine would strike off her
husbands head next day every day through the stony streets the
tumbrils now jolted heavily filled with condemned lovely girls bright
women brown haired black haired and grey youths stalwart men and
old gentle born and peasant born all red wine for la guillotine all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst
liberty equality fraternity or death the last much the easiest to
if the suddenness of her calamity and the whirling wheels of the time
had stunned the doctors daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair it would but have been with her as it was with many but from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of saint antoine she had been true to her duties she was
truest to them in the season of trial as all the quietly loyal and good
as soon as they were established in their new residence and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time little lucie she taught
as regularly as if they had all been united in their english home the
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited the little preparations for his speedy
return the setting aside of his chair and his books these and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death were almost the only
she did not greatly alter in appearance the plain dark dresses akin to
mourning dresses which she and her child wore were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days she lost her colour
and the old and intent expression was a constant not an occasional
thing otherwise she remained very pretty and comely sometimes at
night on kissing her father she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day and would say that her sole reliance under heaven
was on him he always resolutely answered nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge and i know that i can save him lucie
they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks when her
father said to her on coming home one evening
my dear there is an upper window in the prison to which charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon when he can get to
it which depends on many uncertainties and incidents he might see you
in the street he thinks if you stood in a certain place that i can
show you but you will not be able to see him my poor child and even
if you could it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition
o show me the place my father and i will go there every day
from that time in all weathers she waited there two hours as the
clock struck two she was there and at four she turned resignedly away
when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her they
went together at other times she was alone but she never missed a
it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street the hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning was the only house at that
end all else was wall on the third day of her being there he noticed
this mode of address was now prescribed by decree it had been
established voluntarily some time ago among the more thorough patriots
the wood sawyer who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture he
had once been a mender of roads cast a glance at the prison pointed
at the prison and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
but its not my business said he and went on sawing his wood
next day he was looking out for her and accosted her the moment she
ah a child too your mother is it not my little citizeness
do i say yes mamma whispered little lucie drawing close to her
ah but its not my business my work is my business see my saw i
call it my little guillotine la la la la la la and off his head
the billet fell as he spoke and he threw it into a basket
i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine see here again
loo loo loo loo loo loo and off her head comes now a child
tickle tickle pickle pickle and off its head comes all the
lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket but it was
impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was at work and not be in
his sight thenceforth to secure his good will she always spoke to him
first and often gave him drink money which he readily received
he was an inquisitive fellow and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates and in lifting her heart
up to her husband she would come to herself to find him looking at her
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work but its
not my business he would generally say at those times and would
in all weathers in the snow and frost of winter in the bitter winds of
spring in the hot sunshine of summer in the rains of autumn and again
in the snow and frost of winter lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place and every day on leaving it she kissed the prison wall
her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in
five or six times it might be twice or thrice running it might be not
for a week or a fortnight together it was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day seven days a week
these occupations brought her round to the december month wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head on a lightly snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner it was a day of some wild
rejoicing and a festival she had seen the houses as she came along
decorated with little pikes and with little red caps stuck upon them
also with tricoloured ribbons also with the standard inscription
tricoloured letters were the favourite republic one and indivisible
the miserable shop of the wood sawyer was so small that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend he had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him however who had squeezed death in
with most inappropriate difficulty on his house top he displayed pike
and cap as a good citizen must and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his little sainte guillotine for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised his shop was shut and he
was not there which was a relief to lucie and left her quite alone
but he was not far off for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along which filled her with fear a moment
afterwards and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall in the midst of whom was the wood sawyer hand in hand with
the vengeance there could not be fewer than five hundred people and
they were dancing like five thousand demons there was no other music
than their own singing they danced to the popular revolution song
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison
men and women danced together women danced together men danced
together as hazard had brought them together at first they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags but as they
filled the place and stopped to dance about lucie some ghastly
apparition of a dance figure gone raving mad arose among them they
advanced retreated struck at one anothers hands clutched at one
anothers heads spun round alone caught one another and spun round
in pairs until many of them dropped while those were down the rest
linked hand in hand and all spun round together then the ring broke
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once began again struck clutched and tore and then
reversed the spin and all spun round another way suddenly they stopped
again paused struck out the time afresh formed into lines the width
of the public way and with their heads low down and their hands high
up swooped screaming off no fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance it was so emphatically a fallen sport a something once
innocent delivered over to all devilry a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood bewildering the senses and steeling the
heart such grace as was visible in it made it the uglier showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become the maidenly
bosom bared to this the pretty almost childs head thus distracted the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt were types of
this was the carmagnole as it passed leaving lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood sawyers house the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft as if it had never been
o my father for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand such a cruel bad sight
i know my dear i know i have seen it many times dont be
frightened not one of them would harm you
i am not frightened for myself my father but when i think of my
we will set him above their mercies very soon i left him climbing to
the window and i came to tell you there is no one here to see you may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof
i do so father and i send him my soul with it
no father said lucie yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand
a footstep in the snow madame defarge i salute you citizeness
from the doctor i salute you citizen this in passing nothing more
madame defarge gone like a shadow over the white road
give me your arm my love pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage for his sake that was well done they had left the spot
it shall not be in vain charles is summoned for to morrow
there is no time to lose i am well prepared but there are precautions
to be taken that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the tribunal he has not received the notice yet but i know
that he will presently be summoned for to morrow and removed to the
conciergerie i have timely information you are not afraid
she could scarcely answer i trust in you
do so implicitly your suspense is nearly ended my darling he shall
be restored to you within a few hours i have encompassed him with every
he stopped there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing they
both knew too well what it meant one two three three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow
i must see lorry the doctor repeated turning her another way
the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust had never left it he
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national what he could save for the owners he saved no
better man living to hold fast by what tellsons had in keeping and to
a murky red and yellow sky and a rising mist from the seine denoted
the approach of darkness it was almost dark when they arrived at the
bank the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted above a heap of dust and ashes in the court ran the letters
national property republic one and indivisible liberty equality
who could that be with mr lorry the owner of the riding coat upon the
chair who must not be seen from whom newly arrived did he come out
agitated and surprised to take his favourite in his arms to whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words when raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued
he said removed to the conciergerie and summoned for to morrow
the dread tribunal of five judges public prosecutor and determined
jury sat every day their lists went forth every evening and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners the
standard gaoler joke was come out and listen to the evening paper you
so at last began the evening paper at la force
when a name was called its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded charles
evremonde called darnay had reason to know the usage he had seen
his bloated gaoler who wore spectacles to read with glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place and went through the
list making a similar short pause at each name there were twenty three
names but only twenty were responded to for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten the list was read in the vaulted chamber
where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival every one of those had perished in the massacre every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with had died on the
there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was
soon over it was the incident of every day and the society of la force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert for that evening they crowded to the grates and shed tears
there but twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled and the time was at best short to the lock up hour when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night the prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling their ways arose out of the condition of the
time similarly though with a subtle difference a species of fervour
or intoxication known without doubt to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily and to die by it was not mere
boastfulness but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind in
seasons of pestilence some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease a terrible passing inclination to die of it and all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts only needing circumstances to evoke
the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark the night in its
vermin haunted cells was long and cold next day fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before charles darnays name was called all the fifteen
were condemned and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half
charles evremonde called darnay was at length arraigned
his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head dress otherwise prevailing looking
at the jury and the turbulent audience he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed and that the felons were trying the
honest men the lowest cruelest and worst populace of a city never
without its quantity of low cruel and bad were the directing
spirits of the scene noisily commenting applauding disapproving
anticipating and precipitating the result without a check of the men
the greater part were armed in various ways of the women some wore
knives some daggers some ate and drank as they looked on many
knitted among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked she was in a front row by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly
remembered as defarge he noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear and that she seemed to be his wife but what he most noticed
in the two figures was that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be they never looked towards him they seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination and they looked at
the jury but at nothing else under the president sat doctor manette
in his usual quiet dress as well as the prisoner could see he and mr
lorry were the only men there unconnected with the tribunal who
wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
charles evremonde called darnay was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the republic under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of death it was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to france there he was and there was
the decree he had been taken in france and his head was demanded
take off his head cried the audience an enemy to the republic
the president rang his bell to silence those cries and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
was he not an emigrant then what did he call himself
not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law
because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left
his country he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use to live by his own industry in
england rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france
he handed in the names of two witnesses theophile gabelle and
but he had married in england the president reminded him
lucie manette only daughter of doctor manette the good physician who
this answer had a happy effect upon the audience cries in exaltation
of the well known good physician rent the hall so capriciously were
the people moved that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him
on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had set his foot
according to doctor manettes reiterated instructions the same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him and had prepared every
the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not
he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had no means
of living in france save those he had resigned whereas in england
he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature
he had returned when he did on the pressing and written entreaty of
a french citizen who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence he had come back to save a citizens life and to bear his
testimony at whatever personal hazard to the truth was that criminal
the populace cried enthusiastically no and the president rang his
bell to quiet them which it did not for they continued to cry no
until they left off of their own will
the president required the name of that citizen the accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness he also referred with confidence
to the citizens letter which had been taken from him at the barrier
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the doctor had taken care that it should be there had assured him that
it would be there and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read citizen gabelle was called to confirm it and did so citizen
gabelle hinted with infinite delicacy and politeness that in the
pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbaye in fact had rather passed out
of the tribunals patriotic remembrance until three days ago when he
had been summoned before it and had been set at liberty on the jurys
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered as to himself by the surrender of the citizen evremonde
doctor manette was next questioned his high personal popularity
and the clearness of his answers made a great impression but as he
proceeded as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment that the accused had remained in
england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile that so far from being in favour with the aristocrat
government there he had actually been tried for his life by it as
the foe of england and friend of the united states as he brought these
circumstances into view with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and the
populace became one at last when he appealed by name to monsieur
lorry an english gentleman then and there present who like himself
had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his
account of it the jury declared that they had heard enough and that
they were ready with their votes if the president were content to
at every vote the jurymen voted aloud and individually the populace
set up a shout of applause all the voices were in the prisoners
then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy or which they regarded as some set off against
their swollen account of cruel rage no man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable it is probable
to a blending of all the three with the second predominating no sooner
was the acquittal pronounced than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion none the less because he knew very well that the very same
people carried by another current would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried
rescued him from these caresses for the moment five were to be tried
together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed so quick was the tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost that these five came down to
him before he left the place condemned to die within twenty four
hours the first of them told him so with the customary prison sign
of death a raised finger and they all added in words long live the
the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen their proceedings
for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate there was a great
crowd about it in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
court except two for which he looked in vain on his coming out the
concourse made at him anew weeping embracing and shouting all by
turns and all together until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted seemed to run mad like the people on the
they put him into a great chair they had among them and which they had
taken either out of the court itself or one of its rooms or passages
over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top in this car of triumph not
even the doctors entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on mens shoulders with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine
in wild dreamlike procession embracing whom they met and pointing
him out they carried him on reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing republican colour in winding and tramping through them as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived her father
had gone on before to prepare her and when her husband stood upon his
as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen a few of the people fell to dancing instantly all the
rest fell to dancing and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole
then they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets and along the rivers bank
and over the bridge the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
after grasping the doctors hand as he stood victorious and proud
before him after grasping the hand of mr lorry who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole
after kissing little lucie who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who
lifted her he took his wife in his arms and carried her up to their
o dearest charles let me thank god for this on my knees as i have
they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts when she was again in
and now speak to your father dearest no other man in all this france
could have done what he has done for me
she laid her head upon her fathers breast as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast long long ago he was happy in the return he
had made her he was recompensed for his suffering he was proud of his
strength you must not be weak my darling he remonstrated dont
i have saved him it was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back he was really here and yet his wife trembled and a
all the air round was so thick and dark the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched that her
