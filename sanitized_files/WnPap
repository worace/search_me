soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shoot them the
we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent got
halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides
and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry who had to wait
at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a
russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to
blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after
an hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog that
was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were
descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at
first irregularly at varying intervals trata tat and then more and
more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began
not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having
stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their
commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy
lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from
the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action
began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into
the valley the fourth column with which kutuzov was stood on the
below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the
higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was
going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed
six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one
it was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down
below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood
with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear
blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson
float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army
and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of
the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we
intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this
side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could
distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak
which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab
horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills
which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian
troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of
firing in the valley not a single muscle of his face which in those
days was still thin moved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one
spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian force
had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and
regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in a
hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian
columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one
direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the
mist from information he had received the evening before from the
sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by
the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all
indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted
the center of the russian army and that that center was already
sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not
today was a great day for him the anniversary of his coronation before
dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good
spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy
mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat
motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold
face wore that special look of confident self complacent happiness that
one sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind
him not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the
pratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist
when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were
aglow with dazzling light as if he had only awaited this to begin the
action he drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with
it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals
accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a
few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly
toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by
russian troops moving down the valley to their left
at eight oclock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth
column miloradovichs the one that was to take the place of
przebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone down into
the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them
the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead that
column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted
prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the
commander in chiefs suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement
and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
a long awaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not
know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of
our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in
our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now be
carried out was forgotten now entering into weyrothers plan prince
andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
might call for his rapidity of perception and decision
to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces
could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would
concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thought
he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard in
hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me
he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
seeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with which
in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a
hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a
milk white sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing
above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb
of the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist
some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably
was for something could be descried on the right the guards were
entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
then a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar masses
of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front and
behind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemed
worn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt
without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in
do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village
he said angrily to a general who had ridden up dont you understand
your excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrow
village streets when we are marching against the enemy
i intended to re form them beyond the village your excellency
youll make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy very
the enemy is still far away your excellency according to the
the dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly who told you that
my dear fellow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the old man is
an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
galloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperors name had the fourth
kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon
prince andrew who was beside him seeing him kutuzovs malevolent and
caustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being done
was not his adjutants fault and still not answering the austrian
go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed the
village tell it to stop and await my orders
hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him
and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what are
they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still not
prince andrew galloped off to execute the order
overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped the
third division and convinced himself that there really were no
sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of the
regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to throw
out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away
there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
hidden by dense mist having given orders in the commander in chiefs
name to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutuzov
still in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes the
troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets
all right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to a
general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all
plenty of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst of a
just then at a distance behind kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments
saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
line of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they were
greeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front
of which kutuzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to one
side and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen galloped
what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of them
rode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform with
white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who
was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperors
followed by their suites kutuzov affecting the manners of an old
soldier at the front gave the command attention and rode up to the
emperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner were suddenly
transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without
reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck
this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished
after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of
olmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad but there
was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his
fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying
expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent
at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two
miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at
the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartoryski
novosiltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richly
dressed gay young men on splendid well groomed fresh only slightly
heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the
emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very
erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
some question most likely he is asking at what oclock they started
thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he
could not repress as he recalled his reception at brunn in the
emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard and
line regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms leading the
tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths
as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a
stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of
success reached kutuzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent of
why arent you beginning michael ilarionovich said the emperor
alexander hurriedly to kutuzov glancing courteously at the same time at
i am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov bending forward
the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not
waiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew noted that
kutuzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting
not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty
the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his
rather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him as
you know michael ilarionovich we are not on the empress field where
a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said the
tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting him if
not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperor
francis continued to look about him and did not listen
that is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a resounding
voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and
again something in his face twitched that is just why i do not begin
sire because we are not on parade and not on the empress field said
in the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he
certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say
the tsar looked intently and observantly into kutuzovs eye waiting to
hear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov with respectfully
bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about a
however if you command it your majesty said kutuzov lifting his
head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but
he touched his horse and having called miloradovich the commander of
the column gave him the order to advance
the troops again began to move and two battalions of the novgorod and
one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor
as this apsheron battalion marched by the red faced miloradovich
without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormous
tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined
god be with you general said the emperor
ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite sire 
he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the
gentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french
 indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do sire
miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
behind the emperor the apsheron men excited by the tsars presence
passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold brisk
lads shouted miloradovich in a loud self confident and cheery
voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of
battle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades in
suvorovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that he
forgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first village
glad to do our best shouted the soldiers
the emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had
carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the
field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of
the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that was
being said thought and felt that day by its rider
the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
remark to him pointing to the gallant apsherons
kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an
inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were
the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on the
left the firing became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and was
speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind
looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass
look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the
distance but down the hill before him its the french
the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying
to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces
suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile
and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is
with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more
than five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a dense french
here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought
prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzov
the apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that
very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite
close at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from prince
andrew shouted brothers alls lost and at this as if at a command
confused and ever increasing crowds were running back to where five
minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it
have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be
carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to lose touch
with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlike
himself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once he
would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the same place
and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from
his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him
you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his
the wound is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing the
handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers
stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that
it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right
a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it
the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why
are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired
in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode having
by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutuzov
with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of
artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd of
fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov saw on the slope
of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and
frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry
neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
approached kutuzov of kutuzovs suite only four remained they were all
stop those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander
pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish
him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
kutuzovs suite like a flock of little birds
the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firing at
him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg
several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag
let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the
muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without
oh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked around
bolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of
the feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to the
disordered battalion and at the enemy whats that
but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of
shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to
forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs
here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing
with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him several
hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy
standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion
and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah and
overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that
was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he was
immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and
dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our
artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned
their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry
soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but
he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of
him at the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a red haired
gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a
french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the
distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who
evidently did not realize what they were doing
what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them why
doesnt the red haired gunner run away as he is unarmed why doesnt the
frenchman stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembers
and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the
struggling men and the fate of the red haired gunner who had
triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him
was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it
seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of it
was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
whats this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he and
fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle of
the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the red haired gunner had
been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved
but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the sky the
lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds
gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at all
as i ran thought prince andrew not as we ran shouting and fighting
not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry
faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide
across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky
before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all is vanity
all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but
that but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace
on our right flank commanded by bagration at nine oclock the battle
had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs demand to
commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself
prince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of the
commander in chief bagration knew that as the distance between the two
flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed
which he very likely would be and found the commander in chief which
would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before
bagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite
and the boyish face rostov breathless with excitement and hope was the
first to catch his eye he sent him
and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in chief
your excellency said rostov with his hand to his cap
you can give the message to his majesty said dolgorukov hurriedly
on being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a few
hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with
elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that
state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy
all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a
general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was
orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a
message to kutuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning
was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy
and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and
galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of bagrations
troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing
motionless then he came to the region occupied by uvarovs cavalry and
here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having
passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and
musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louder
in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots
at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading and
mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets
visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going
on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make
out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort
were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why
whither and who they were it was impossible to make out these sights
and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on the
go on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and
again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and
farther into the region where the army was already in action
how it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought
after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
so much the better i shall see it close he thought
he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came
galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks
were returning from the attack rostov got out of their way
involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on
that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many
hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole
width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and
across his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the
same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the
horses were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and
the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and
even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guards
advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them
the horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horses
rostov could already see their faces and heard the command charge
shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed
rostov fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the french
galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still was
the last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily
on seeing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably collide this
guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his bedouin over
rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
and horses had it not occurred to rostov to flourish his whip before
the eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands
high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman drove
his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and
extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards
passed rostov before he heard them shout hurrah and looking back saw
that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with
red epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for
immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
at that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared in
the smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that
amazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear later that of
all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich
youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their
thousand ruble horses only eighteen were left after the charge
why should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall see
the emperor immediately thought rostov and galloped on
when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and
around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much
because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the
soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a
i say weve been in the front line our regiment attacked said boris
with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under
have you he said well how did it go
we drove them back said boris with animation growing talkative can
you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken up
their position and seeing troops before them thought they were
austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
unexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing boris to the end
there he is said boris thinking rostov had said his highness and
pointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders and frowning
brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and horse
guards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrian
but thats the grand duke and i want the commander in chief or the
emperor said rostov and was about to spur his horse
count count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager as
boris count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed his
bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at the
front i held my sword in my left hand count all our family the von
he said something more but rostov did not wait to hear it and rode
having passed the guards and traversed an empty space rostov to avoid
again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse
guards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the place
where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly he
heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops
where he could never have expected the enemy to be
what can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army
impossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it may he
reflected there is no riding round it now i must look for the
commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more and
more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds
what does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is firing
rostov kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian soldiers
the devil knows theyve killed everybody its all up now he was
told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives who
understood what was happening as little as he did
several wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screams
and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died down
rostov learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firing
my god what does it all mean thought he and here where at any
moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only a handful
of scoundrels it will soon be over it cant be that it cant be only
the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostovs head though he
saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where he
had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could not did
rostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near the
village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he
urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but
the farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on
which he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all
sorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded and
some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries
where is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept asking everyone he
could stop but got no answer from anyone
at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer
eh brother theyve all bolted long ago said the soldier laughing
having left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostov stopped the
horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
question him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in a
carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
it cant be said rostov it must have been someone else
i saw him myself replied the man with a self confident smile of
derision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times ive seen
him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in the
carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horses fly
gracious me they did rattle past its time i knew the imperial horses
and ilya ivanych i dont think ilya drives anyone except the tsar
rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a wounded
who is it you want he asked the commander in chief he was killed
by a cannon ball struck in the breast before our regiment
not kutuzov but whats his name well never mind there are not
many left alive go that way to that village all the commanders are
there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and he
rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
going the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible to
doubt it now rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in which
he saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to say
to the tsar or to kutuzov even if they were alive and unwounded
take this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a
soldier shouted to him theyd kill you there
oh what are you talking about said another where is he to go that
rostov considered and then went in the direction where they said he
its all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to save
myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest number
of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had not yet
occupied that region and the russians the uninjured and slightly
wounded had left it long ago all about the field like heaps of manure
on well kept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each
couple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes and one
could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feigned or
so it seemed to rostov he put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all
these suffering men and he felt afraid afraid not for his life but
for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of
the french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots the
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in rostovs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for
himself he remembered his mothers last letter what would she feel
thought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed
in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from the
field of battle who though still in some confusion were less
disordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
sounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was
lost no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperor or
kutuzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was
correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had
spread by the fact that the emperors carriage had really galloped from
the field of battle with the pale and terrified ober hofmarschal count
tolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the
emperors suite one officer told rostov that he had seen someone from
headquarters behind the village to the left and thither rostov rode
not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience when he had
ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian troops he
saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horseback
facing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to
rostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which rostov fancied he
had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spurs
and giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled
from the bank under the horses hind hoofs turning the horse sharply
he again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with
the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same the
rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily riveted
his attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by
that gesture rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored
but it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought
rostov at that moment alexander turned his head and rostov saw the
beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperor
was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the
mildness of his features was all the greater rostov was happy in the
assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false he
was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even ought to go
straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him to
but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the
thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a
chance of delay and flight when the longed for moment comes and he is
alone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he had longed
for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach
the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
what it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of his
being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant or
painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him
now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of
him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that
he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speeches
were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to
be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was
dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and
while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved
besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right
flank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost no
certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on his
reflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
look or bad opinion from him rostov decided and sorrowfully and with
a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar
who still remained in the same attitude of indecision
while rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away
captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the
emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him
to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling
unwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him
rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long
and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping
covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls hand
and i might have been in his place thought rostov and hardly
restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter
despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding
his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it
was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not
made use of it what have i done thought he and he turned round
and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but there
was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages were
passing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutuzovs staff were
not far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostov followed
them in front of him walked kutuzovs groom leading horses in
horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old bandy
legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat
oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed in
silence and then the same joke was repeated
before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points more
than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french
przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns
after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
the remains of langerons and dokhturovs mingled forces were crowding
around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd
after five oclock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade
delivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerous
batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at our
in the rearguard dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up
a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops it
was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the
old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the
floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for
so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
driven their two horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
with flour whitening their carts on that narrow dam amid the wagons and
the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels men
disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one another
dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move on
a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way
every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a
shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and
dolokhov now an officer wounded in the arm and on foot with the
regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company
represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by the
crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in
on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone
behind them another fell in front and splashed dolokhov with blood the
crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few
move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here another
two minutes and it is certain death thought each one
dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of
the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery
turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked under
him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it bears
the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it
would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even
under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank
hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the
entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
dolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of
get onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear go on
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the
general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were
one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond
the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped
into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist
the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but
from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go
