how well bred it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just
it was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once
picked up a confession which had been written out in advance in order
that she might not forget it by a sinner of seven years
father i accuse myself of having been avaricious
father i accuse myself of having been an adulteress
father i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen
it was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six
years of age improvised the following tale which was listened to by
there were three little cocks who owned a country where there were
a great many flowers they plucked the flowers and put them in their
pockets after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their
playthings there was a wolf in that country there was a great deal of
forest and the wolf was in the forest and he ate the little cocks
it was punchinello who bestowed it on the cat
it was not good for her it hurt her
it was there that a little abandoned child a foundling whom the convent
was bringing up out of charity uttered this sweet and heart breaking
saying she heard the others talking of their mothers and she murmured
as for me my mother was not there when i was born
there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the
corridors with her bunch of keys and whose name was sister agatha the
big big girls those over ten years of age called her agathocles
the refectory a large apartment of an oblong square form which
received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the
garden was dark and damp and as the children say full of beasts all
the places round about furnished their contingent of insects
each of its four corners had received in the language of the pupils
a special and expressive name there was spider corner caterpillar
cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed it was not
so cold there as elsewhere from the refectory the names had passed to
the boarding school and there served as in the old college mazarin
to distinguish four nations every pupil belonged to one of these four
nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at
meals one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral
visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the
he inquired of another pupil a charming brunette with rosy cheeks who
every house of this sort has its own peculiarities at the beginning of
this century ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where
young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august at
ecouen in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament
a distinction was made between virgins and florists there were also the
dais and the censors the first who held the cords of the dais and
the others who carried incense before the holy sacrament the flowers
belonged by right to the florists four virgins walked in advance on
the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question
put in the dormitory who is a virgin
madame campan used to quote this saying of a little one of seven
years to a big girl of sixteen who took the head of the procession
while she the little one remained at the rear you are a virgin but
above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white
paternoster and which possessed the property of bearing people straight
to paradise was inscribed in large black letters
little white paternoster which god made which god said which god
placed in paradise in the evening when i went to bed i found three
angels sitting on my bed one at the foot two at the head the good
virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation
the good god is my father the good virgin is my mother the three
apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters the shirt in
which god was born envelopes my body saint margarets cross is written
on my breast madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping
for god when she met m saint john monsieur saint john whence come
you i come from ave salus you have not seen the good god where
is he he is on the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands
nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head whoever shall say
this thrice at eventide thrice in the morning shall win paradise at
in 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under
a triple coating of daubing paint at the present time it is finally
disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and
a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this
refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened on the
garden two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed
two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory
the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors
constitute the only variety in convents the meals were plain and
the food of the children themselves severe a single dish of meat and
vegetables combined or salt fish such was their luxury this meagre
fare which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an
exception the children ate in silence under the eye of the mother
whose turn it was who if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against
the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time this silence
was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little
pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix the
reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn at regular distances
on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the
pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks and into which
they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish this was
punished these bowls were called ronds deau the child who broke the
silence made a cross with her tongue where on the ground she licked
the pavement the dust that end of all joys was charged with the
chastisement of those poor little rose leaves which had been guilty of
there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as
a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read it is the rule of
saint benoit an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate nemo
the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set
to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by
the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume
from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate
amount of pleasure the most interesting thing they found were some
unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys
they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby
fruit trees in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of
the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they
sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or
an inhabited pear on the sly i will now cede the privilege of speech
to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty
years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most
elegant women in paris i quote literally one hides ones pear or
ones apple as best one may when one goes up stairs to put the veil on
the bed before supper one stuffs them under ones pillow and at night
one eats them in bed and when one cannot do that one eats them in the
closet that was one of their greatest luxuries
once it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the
convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was
connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask
for a days leave of absence an enormity in so austere a community the
wager was accepted but not one of those who bet believed that she would
do it when the moment came as the archbishop was passing in front of
the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her
companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a days
leave of absence mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the
prettiest little rosy face in the world m de quelen smiled and said
what my dear child a days leave of absence three days if you like
i grant you three days the prioress could do nothing the archbishop
had spoken horror of the convent but joy of the pupil the effect may
this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the
life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance
did not make their way in to prove this we will confine ourselves to
recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact
which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by
any thread whatever with the story which we are relating we mention the
fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the
about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was
not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as
madame albertine nothing was known about her save that she was mad
and that in the world she passed for dead beneath this history it
was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great
this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably
pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes could she see there
was some doubt about this she glided rather than walked she never
spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed her nostrils were
livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh to touch her
hand was like touching snow she possessed a strange spectral grace
wherever she entered people felt cold one day a sister on seeing her
pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman perhaps
a hundred tales were told of madame albertine this arose from the
eternal curiosity of the pupils in the chapel there was a gallery
called loeil de boeuf it was in this gallery which had only a
circular bay an oeil de boeuf that madame albertine listened to the
offices she always occupied it alone because from this gallery being
on the level of the first story the preacher or the officiating priest
could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns one day the pulpit was
occupied by a young priest of high rank m le duc de rohan peer of
france officer of the red musketeers in 1815 when he was prince de
leon and who died afterward in 1830 as cardinal and archbishop of
besancon it was the first time that m de rohan had preached at the
petit picpus convent madame albertine usually preserved perfect
calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services that
day as soon as she caught sight of m de rohan she half rose and
said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel ah auguste
the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preacher raised
his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility a
breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant
across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad
those two words however had set every one in the convent who had the
privilege of speech to chattering how many things were contained in
that ah auguste what revelations m de rohans name really was
auguste it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very
highest society since she knew m de rohan and that her own rank there
was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord
and that there existed between them some connection of relationship
perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet
two very severe duchesses mesdames de choiseul and de serent often
visited the community whither they penetrated no doubt in virtue of
the privilege magnates mulieres and caused great consternation in the
boarding school when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young
moreover m de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of
attention to the school girls at that epoch he had just been made
while waiting for the episcopate vicar general of the archbishop of
paris it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the
offices in the chapel of the nuns of the petit picpus not one of the
young recluses could see him because of the serge curtain but he had
a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to
distinguish he had been a mousquetaire and then he was said to be
very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in
a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent
moire and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the
world he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years
not a sound from without made its way into the convent but there was
one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither this was an
event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall
it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood this flute always
played the same air an air which is very far away nowadays my
zetulbe come reign oer my soul and it was heard two or three
times a day the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal
mothers were upset by it brains were busy punishments descended in
showers this lasted for several months the girls were all more or
less in love with the unknown musician each one dreamed that she was
zetulbe the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue
droit mur and they would have given anything compromised everything
attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only
for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously
and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time there
were some who made their escape by a back door and ascended to the
third story on the rue droit mur side in order to attempt to catch a
glimpse through the gaps impossible one even went so far as to thrust
her arm through the grating and to wave her white handkerchief two
were still bolder they found means to climb on a roof and risked their
lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man he was an
old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in
his attic in order to pass the time
in this enclosure of the petit picpus there were three perfectly
distinct buildings the great convent inhabited by the nuns the
boarding school where the scholars were lodged and lastly what was
called the little convent it was a building with a garden in which
lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders the relics of cloisters
destroyed in the revolution a reunion of all the black gray and white
medleys of all communities and all possible varieties what might be
called if such a coupling of words is permissible a sort of harlequin
when the empire was established all these poor old dispersed and exiled
women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the
wings of the bernardines benedictines the government paid them a small
pension the ladies of the petit picpus received them cordially it was
a singular pell mell each followed her own rule sometimes the pupils
of the boarding school were allowed as a great recreation to pay them
a visit the result is that all those young memories have
retained among other souvenirs that of mother sainte bazile mother
one of these refugees found herself almost at home she was a nun of
sainte aure the only one of her order who had survived the ancient
convent of the ladies of sainte aure occupied at the beginning of the
eighteenth century this very house of the petit picpus which belonged
later to the benedictines of martin verga this holy woman too poor to
wear the magnificent habit of her order which was a white robe with
a scarlet scapulary had piously put it on a little manikin which she
exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at
her death in 1824 only one nun of this order remained to day there
in addition to these worthy mothers some old society women had obtained
permission of the prioress like madame albertine to retire into the
little convent among the number were madame beaufort dhautpoul and
marquise dufresne another was never known in the convent except by
the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose the pupils
about 1820 or 1821 madame de genlis who was at that time editing a
little periodical publication called lintrepide asked to be allowed
to enter the convent of the petit picpus as lady resident the duc
dorleans recommended her uproar in the hive the vocal mothers were
all in a flutter madame de genlis had made romances but she declared
that she was the first to detest them and then she had reached her
fierce stage of devotion with the aid of god and of the prince she
entered she departed at the end of six or eight months alleging as a
reason that there was no shade in the garden the nuns were delighted
although very old she still played the harp and did it very well
when she went away she left her mark in her cell madame de genlis was
superstitious and a latinist these two words furnish a tolerably good
profile of her a few years ago there were still to be seen pasted in
the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her
silverware and her jewels these five lines in latin written with
her own hand in red ink on yellow paper and which in her opinion
hos versus dicas ne tu furto tua perdas
these verses in sixth century latin raise the question whether the
two thieves of calvary were named as is commonly believed dismas and
gestas or dismas and gesmas this orthography might have confounded the
pretensions put forward in the last century by the vicomte de gestas of
a descent from the wicked thief however the useful virtue attached to
these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospitallers
the church of the house constructed in such a manner as to separate the
great convent from the boarding school like a veritable intrenchment
was of course common to the boarding school the great convent and
the little convent the public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto
entrance on the street but all was so arranged that none of the
inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world
suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand and
folded in such a manner as to form not as in ordinary churches a
prolongation behind the altar but a sort of hall or obscure cellar to
the right of the officiating priest suppose this hall to be shut off by
a curtain seven feet in height of which we have already spoken in the
shadow of that curtain pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir
on the left the school girls on the right the lay sisters and the
novices at the bottom and you will have some idea of the nuns of the
petit picpus assisting at divine service that cavern which was called
the choir communicated with the cloister by a lobby the church was
lighted from the garden when the nuns were present at services where
their rule enjoined silence the public was warned of their presence
only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling
during the six years which separate 1819 from 1825 the prioress of the
petit picpus was mademoiselle de blemeur whose name in religion
was mother innocente she came of the family of marguerite de blemeur
author of lives of the saints of the order of saint benoit she had
been re elected she was a woman about sixty years of age short thick
singing like a cracked pot says the letter which we have already
quoted an excellent woman moreover and the only merry one in the
whole convent and for that reason adored she was learned erudite
wise competent curiously proficient in history crammed with latin
stuffed with greek full of hebrew and more of a benedictine monk than
the sub prioress was an old spanish nun mother cineres who was almost
the most esteemed among the vocal mothers were mother sainte honorine
the treasurer mother sainte gertrude the chief mistress of the
novices mother saint ange the assistant mistress mother annonciation
the sacristan mother saint augustin the nurse the only one in the
convent who was malicious then mother sainte mechtilde mademoiselle
gauvain very young and with a beautiful voice mother des anges
mademoiselle drouet who had been in the convent of the filles dieu
and in the convent du tresor between gisors and magny mother
saint joseph mademoiselle de cogolludo mother sainte adelaide
cifuentes who could not resist austerities mother compassion
mademoiselle de la miltiere received at the age of sixty in defiance
of the rule and very wealthy mother providence mademoiselle de
laudiniere mother presentation mademoiselle de siguenza who was
prioress in 1847 and finally mother sainte celigne sister of the
sculptor ceracchi who went mad mother sainte chantal mademoiselle de
there was also among the prettiest of them a charming girl of three
and twenty who was from the isle de bourbon a descendant of the
chevalier roze whose name had been mademoiselle roze and who was
mother sainte mechtilde intrusted with the singing and the choir was
fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter she usually took a
complete scale of them that is to say seven from ten to sixteen years
of age inclusive of assorted voices and sizes whom she made sing
standing drawn up in a line side by side according to age from the
smallest to the largest this presented to the eye something in the
nature of a reed pipe of young girls a sort of living pan pipe made of
those of the lay sisters whom the scholars loved most were sister
euphrasie sister sainte marguerite sister sainte marthe who was in
her dotage and sister sainte michel whose long nose made them laugh
all these women were gentle with the children the nuns were severe only
towards themselves no fire was lighted except in the school and the
food was choice compared to that in the convent moreover they lavished
a thousand cares on their scholars only when a child passed near a nun
this rule of silence had had this effect that throughout the whole
convent speech had been withdrawn from human creatures and bestowed
on inanimate objects now it was the church bell which spoke now it was
the gardeners bell a very sonorous bell placed beside the portress
and which was audible throughout the house indicated by its varied
peals which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph all the actions of
material life which were to be performed and summoned to the parlor in
case of need such or such an inhabitant of the house each person
and each thing had its own peal the prioress had one and one the
sub prioress one and two six five announced lessons so that the pupils
never said to go to lessons but to go to six five four four was
madame de genliss signal it was very often heard cest le diable
a quatre its the very deuce said the uncharitable tennine strokes
announced a great event it was the opening of the door of seclusion
a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its
with the exception of the archbishop and the gardener no man entered
the convent as we have already said the schoolgirls saw two others
one the chaplain the abbe banes old and ugly whom they were
permitted to contemplate in the choir through a grating the other the
drawing master m ansiaux whom the letter of which we have perused a
few lines calls m anciot and describes as a frightful old hunchback
it will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen
after having sketched its moral face it will not prove unprofitable
to point out in a few words its material configuration the reader
the convent of the petit picpus sainte antoine filled almost the whole
of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the rue
polonceau the rue droit mur the rue petit picpus and the unused lane
called rue aumarais on old plans these four streets surrounded this
trapezium like a moat the convent was composed of several buildings
and a garden the principal building taken in its entirety was a
juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which viewed from a birds eye
view outlined with considerable exactness a gibbet laid flat on the
ground the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment
of the rue droit mur comprised between the rue petit picpus and the rue
polonceau the lesser arm was a lofty gray severe grated facade which
faced the rue petit picpus the carriage entrance no 62 marked its
extremity towards the centre of this facade was a low arched door
whitened with dust and ashes where the spiders wove their webs
and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays and on rare
occasions when the coffin of a nun left the convent this was the
public entrance of the church the elbow of the gibbet was a square
hall which was used as the servants hall and which the nuns called the
buttery in the main arm were the cells of the mothers the sisters and
the novices in the lesser arm lay the kitchens the refectory backed
up by the cloisters and the church between the door no 62 and the
corner of the closed lane aumarais was the school which was not
visible from without the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden
which was much lower than the level of the rue polonceau which caused
the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside the
garden which was slightly arched had in its centre on the summit of
a hillock a fine pointed and conical fir tree whence ran as from
the peaked boss of a shield four grand alleys and ranged by twos
in between the branchings of these eight small ones so that if the
enclosure had been circular the geometrical plan of the alleys would
have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel as the alleys all ended
in the very irregular walls of the garden they were of unequal length
they were bordered with currant bushes at the bottom an alley of tall
poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent which was at the angle of
the rue droit mur to the house of the little convent which was at the
angle of the aumarais lane in front of the little convent was what was
called the little garden to this whole let the reader add a courtyard
all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings prison
walls the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the
rue polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood and he will
be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the
bernardines of the petit picpus was forty years ago this holy house
had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis ground of the
fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the tennis ground
all these streets moreover were more ancient than paris these names
droit mur and aumarais are very ancient the streets which bear them
are very much more ancient still aumarais lane was called maugout lane
the rue droit mur was called the rue des eglantiers for god opened
since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the
petit picpus was in former times and since we have ventured to open
a window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit us one other
little digression utterly foreign to this book but characteristic and
useful since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures
in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey
of fontevrault she had even been in society before the revolution she
talked a great deal of m de miromesnil keeper of the seals under louis
xvi and of a presidentess duplat with whom she had been very intimate
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every
pretext she told wonders of the abbey of fontevrault that it was like
a city and that there were streets in the monastery
she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils every year
she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she
said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur
saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur
saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur
saint procopius etc etc and thus i give it to you father and the
school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under
their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers
on another occasion the centenarian was telling stories she said
that in her youth the bernardine monks were every whit as good as the
mousquetaires it was a century which spoke through her but it was the
eighteenth century she told about the custom of the four wines which
existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne when a great
personage a marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed
a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue
him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they
had poured four different sorts of wine on the first goblet this
inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the
third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine these four legends express
the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication
which enlivens the second that which irritates the third that which
in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which
she thought a great deal the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this
she would not show this object to anyone she shut herself up which her
rule allowed her to do and hid herself every time that she desired to
contemplate it if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the
cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands as
soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond
of talking the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most
tenacious by her obstinacy thus it furnished a subject of comment for
all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent what could that
treasure of the centenarian be which was so precious and so secret
some holy book no doubt some unique chaplet some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures when the poor old woman died
they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and
opened it they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth like some
consecrated paten it was a faenza platter representing little loves
flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes
the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures one of the
charming little loves is already fairly spitted he is resisting
fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the
dancer is laughing with a satanical air moral love conquered by the
colic this platter which is very curious and which had possibly
the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea was still in existence
in september 1845 it was for sale by a bric a brac merchant in the
this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because
however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to
convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the
same severity in other convents at the convent of the rue du temple
in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black
shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a
salon with a polished wood floor whose windows were draped in white
muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames a portrait
of a benedictine nun with unveiled face painted bouquets and even the
it is in that garden of the temple convent that stood that famous
chestnut tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in
france and which bore the reputation among the good people of the
eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the
as we have said this convent of the temple was occupied by benedictines
of the perpetual adoration benedictines quite different from those who
depended on citeaux this order of the perpetual adoration is not very
ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years in 1649 the
holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart in two
churches in paris at saint sulpice and at saint jean en greve a rare
and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar m the
prior and vicar general of saint germain des pres ordered a solemn
procession of all his clergy in which the popes nuncio officiated
but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women madame courtin
marquise de boucs and the comtesse de chateauvieux this outrage
committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but
temporary would not depart from these holy souls and it seemed to
them that it could only be extenuated by a perpetual adoration in some
female monastery both of them one in 1652 the other in 1653 made
donations of notable sums to mother catherine de bar called of the holy
sacrament a benedictine nun for the purpose of founding to this pious
end a monastery of the order of saint benoit the first permission for
this foundation was given to mother catherine de bar by m de metz abbe
of saint germain on condition that no woman could be received unless
she contributed three hundred livres income which amounts to six
thousand livres to the principal after the abbe of saint germain the
king accorded letters patent and all the rest abbatial charter and
royal letters was confirmed in 1654 by the chamber of accounts and the
such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the
benedictines of the perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris
their first convent was a new building in the rue cassette out of the
contributions of mesdames de boucs and de chateauvieux
this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with
the benedictine nuns of citeaux it mounted back to the abbe of
saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred
heart go back to the general of the jesuits and the sisters of charity
it was also totally different from the bernardines of the petit picpus
whose interior we have just shown in 1657 pope alexander vii had
authorized by a special brief the bernardines of the rue petit picpus
to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine nuns of the
holy sacrament but the two orders remained distinct none the less
at the beginning of the restoration the convent of the petit picpus
was in its decay this forms a part of the general death of the order
which after the eighteenth century has been disappearing like all
the religious orders contemplation is like prayer one of humanitys
needs but like everything which the revolution touched it will be
transformed and from being hostile to social progress it will become
the house of the petit picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated in 1840
the little convent had disappeared the school had disappeared there
were no longer any old women nor young girls the first were dead the
the rule of the perpetual adoration is so rigid in its nature that it
alarms vocations recoil before it the order receives no recruits in
1845 it still obtained lay sisters here and there but of professed
nuns none at all forty years ago the nuns numbered nearly a hundred
fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty eight of them how
many are there to day in 1847 the prioress was young a sign that
the circle of choice was restricted she was not forty years old in
proportion as the number diminishes the fatigue increases the service
of each becomes more painful the moment could then be seen drawing near
when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the
heavy rule of saint benoit the burden is implacable and remains the
same for the few as for the many it weighs down it crushes thus they
die at the period when the author of this book still lived in paris
two died one was twenty five years old the other twenty three this
latter can say like julia alpinula hic jaceo vixi annos viginti et
tres it is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the
we have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without
entering it and without introducing the minds which accompany us and
which are listening to our tale to the profit of some perchance of
the melancholy history of jean valjean we have penetrated into this
community full of those old practices which seem so novel to day it
is the closed garden hortus conclusus we have spoken of this singular
place in detail but with respect in so far at least as detail and
respect are compatible we do not understand all but we insult nothing
we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre who
wound up by anointing the executioner and from the sneer of voltaire
who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross
an illogical act on voltaires part we may remark by the way for
voltaire would have defended jesus as he defended calas and even
for those who deny superhuman incarnations what does the crucifix
in this nineteenth century the religious idea is undergoing a crisis
people are unlearning certain things and they do well provided that
while unlearning them they learn this there is no vacuum in the human
heart certain demolitions take place and it is well that they do but
on condition that they are followed by reconstructions
in the meantime let us study things which are no more it is necessary
to know them if only for the purpose of avoiding them the counterfeits
of the past assume false names and gladly call themselves the future
this spectre this past is given to falsifying its own passport let
us inform ourselves of the trap let us be on our guard the past has a
visage superstition and a mask hypocrisy let us denounce the visage
as for convents they present a complex problem a question of
civilization which condemns them a question of liberty which protects
chapter i the convent as an abstract idea
this book is a drama whose leading personage is the infinite
such being the case and a convent having happened to be on our road it
has been our duty to enter it why because the convent which is common
to the orient as well as to the occident to antiquity as well as to
modern times to paganism to buddhism to mahometanism as well as to
christianity is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the
this is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain
ideas nevertheless while absolutely maintaining our reserves our
restrictions and even our indignations we must say that every time we
encounter man in the infinite either well or ill understood we feel
ourselves overpowered with respect there is in the synagogue in the
mosque in the pagoda in the wigwam a hideous side which we execrate
and a sublime side which we adore what a contemplation for the mind
and what endless food for thought is the reverberation of god upon the
chapter ii the convent as an historical fact
from the point of view of history of reason and of truth monasticism
is condemned monasteries when they abound in a nation are clogs in
its circulation cumbrous establishments centres of idleness where
centres of labor should exist monastic communities are to the great
social community what the mistletoe is to the oak what the wart is
to the human body their prosperity and their fatness mean the
impoverishment of the country the monastic regime good at the
beginning of civilization useful in the reduction of the brutal by the
spiritual is bad when peoples have reached their manhood moreover
when it becomes relaxed and when it enters into its period of disorder
it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its
period of purity because it still continues to set the example
claustration has had its day cloisters useful in the early education
of modern civilization have embarrassed its growth and are injurious
to its development so far as institution and formation with relation
to man are concerned monasteries which were good in the tenth century
questionable in the fifteenth are detestable in the nineteenth the
leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful
nations italy and spain the one the light the other the splendor of
europe for centuries and at the present day these two illustrious
peoples are but just beginning to convalesce thanks to the healthy and
the convent the ancient female convent in particular such as it still
presents itself on the threshold of this century in italy in austria
in spain is one of the most sombre concretions of the middle ages the
cloister that cloister is the point of intersection of horrors the
catholic cloister properly speaking is wholly filled with the black
the spanish convent is the most funereal of all there rise in
obscurity beneath vaults filled with gloom beneath domes vague with
shadow massive altars of babel as high as cathedrals there immense
white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark there are extended all
nude on the ebony great christs of ivory more than bleeding bloody
hideous and magnificent with their elbows displaying the bones their
knee pans showing their integuments their wounds showing their flesh
crowned with silver thorns nailed with nails of gold with blood drops
of rubies on their brows and diamond tears in their eyes the diamonds
and rubies seem wet and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep
their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron tipped scourges
their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles their knees excoriated with
prayer women who think themselves wives spectres who think themselves
seraphim do these women think no have they any will no do they
love no do they live no their nerves have turned to bone their
bones have turned to stone their veil is of woven night their breath
under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of
death the abbess a spectre sanctifies them and terrifies them
the immaculate one is there and very fierce such are the ancient
monasteries of spain lairs of terrible devotion caverns of virgins
catholic spain is more roman than rome herself the spanish convent was
above all others the catholic convent there was a flavor of the orient
about it the archbishop the kislar aga of heaven locked up and kept
watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for god the nun was the
odalisque the priest was the eunuch the fervent were chosen in dreams
and possessed christ at night the beautiful nude young man descended
from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one lofty walls
guarded the mystic sultana who had the crucified for her sultan from
all living distraction a glance on the outer world was infidelity the
in pace replaced the leather sack that which was cast into the sea in
the east was thrown into the ground in the west in both quarters women
wrung their hands the waves for the first the grave for the last here
to day the upholders of the past unable to deny these things have
adopted the expedient of smiling at them there has come into fashion
a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history of
invalidating the commentaries of philosophy of eliding all embarrassing
facts and all gloomy questions a matter for declamations say the
clever declamations repeat the foolish jean jacques a declaimer
diderot a declaimer voltaire on calas labarre and sirven declaimers
i know not who has recently discovered that tacitus was a declaimer
that nero was a victim and that pity is decidedly due to that poor
facts however are awkward things to disconcert and they are
obstinate the author of this book has seen with his own eyes eight
leagues distant from brussels there are relics of the middle ages
there which are attainable for everybody at the abbey of villers the
hole of the oubliettes in the middle of the field which was formerly
the courtyard of the cloister and on the banks of the thil four stone
dungeons half under ground half under the water they were in pace
each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door a vault and a
grated opening which on the outside is two feet above the level of the
river and on the inside six feet above the level of the ground four
feet of river flow past along the outside wall the ground is always
soaked the occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed in
one of these dungeons there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to
the wall in another there can be seen a square box made of four slabs
of granite too short for a person to lie down in too low for him to
stand upright in a human being was put inside with a coverlid of stone
on top this exists it can be seen it can be touched these in pace
these dungeons these iron hinges these necklets that lofty peep hole
on a level with the rivers current that box of stone closed with a lid
of granite like a tomb with this difference that the dead man here
was a living being that soil which is but mud that vault hole those
chapter iii on what conditions one can respect the past
monasticism such as it existed in spain and such as it still exists in
thibet is a sort of phthisis for civilization it stops life short it
simply depopulates claustration castration it has been the scourge
of europe add to this the violence so often done to the conscience the
forced vocations feudalism bolstered up by the cloister the right of
the first born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism the
ferocities of which we have just spoken the in pace the closed mouths
the walled up brains so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon
of eternal vows the taking of the habit the interment of living souls
add individual tortures to national degradations and whoever you
may be you will shudder before the frock and the veil those two
winding sheets of human devising nevertheless at certain points and in
certain places in spite of philosophy in spite of progress the spirit
of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century and
a singular ascetic recrudescence is at this moment astonishing
the civilized world the obstinacy of antiquated institutions in
perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume
which should claim our hair the pretensions of the spoiled fish which
should persist in being eaten the persecution of the childs garment
which should insist on clothing the man the tenderness of corpses which
ingrates says the garment i protected you in inclement weather why
will you have nothing to do with me i have just come from the deep
sea says the fish i have been a rose says the perfume i have
loved you says the corpse i have civilized you says the convent
to this there is but one reply in former days
to dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things and of the
government of men by embalming to restore dogmas in a bad condition
to regild shrines to patch up cloisters to rebless reliquaries to
refurnish superstitions to revictual fanaticisms to put new handles
on holy water brushes and militarism to reconstitute monasticism and
militarism to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication
of parasites to force the past on the present this seems strange
still there are theorists who hold such theories these theorists
who are in other respects people of intelligence have a very simple
process they apply to the past a glazing which they call social
order divine right morality family the respect of elders antique
authority sacred tradition legitimacy religion and they go about
shouting look take this honest people this logic was known to the
ancients the soothsayers practise it they rubbed a black heifer over
with chalk and said she is white bos cretatus
as for us we respect the past here and there and we spare it above
all provided that it consents to be dead if it insists on being alive
we attack it and we try to kill it
superstitions bigotries affected devotion prejudices those forms all
forms as they are are tenacious of life they have teeth and nails in
their smoke and they must be clasped close body to body and war must
be made on them and that without truce for it is one of the fatalities
of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms it is
difficult to seize darkness by the throat and to hurl it to the earth
a convent in france in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century is
a college of owls facing the light a cloister caught in the very act
of asceticism in the very heart of the city of 89 and of 1830 and
of 1848 rome blossoming out in paris is an anachronism in ordinary
times in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish
one has only to make it spell out the date but we are not in ordinary
let us fight but let us make a distinction the peculiar property of
truth is never to commit excesses what need has it of exaggeration
there is that which it is necessary to destroy and there is that which
it is simply necessary to elucidate and examine what a force is kindly
and serious examination let us not apply a flame where only a light is
so given the nineteenth century we are opposed as a general
proposition and among all peoples in asia as well as in europe
in india as well as in turkey to ascetic claustration whoever says
cloister says marsh their putrescence is evident their stagnation is
unhealthy their fermentation infects people with fever and etiolates
them their multiplication becomes a plague of egypt we cannot think
without affright of those lands where fakirs bonzes santons greek
monks marabouts talapoins and dervishes multiply even like swarms of
this said the religious question remains this question has certain
mysterious almost formidable sides may we be permitted to look at it
chapter iv the convent from the point of view of principles
men unite themselves and dwell in communities by virtue of what right
they shut themselves up at home by virtue of what right by virtue of
the right which every man has to open or shut his door
they do not come forth by virtue of what right by virtue of the right
to go and come which implies the right to remain at home
they speak in low tones they drop their eyes they toil they renounce
the world towns sensualities pleasures vanities pride interests
they are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen not one of them
possesses in his own right anything whatever on entering there each
