cosette she had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came
across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman while eponine
disguised herself like a man it was she who had conveyed to jean
valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning leave your house
jean valjean had in fact returned home and had said to cosette
we set out this evening and we go to the rue de lhomme arme with
toussaint next week we shall be in london cosette utterly
overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of
lines to marius but how was she to get the letter to the post she
never went out alone and toussaint surprised at such a commission
would certainly show the letter to m fauchelevent in this dilemma
cosette had caught sight through the fence of eponine in mans clothes
who now prowled incessantly around the garden cosette had called to
this young workman and had handed him five francs and the letter
saying carry this letter immediately to its address eponine had put
the letter in her pocket the next day on the 5th of june she went
to courfeyracs quarters to inquire for marius not for the purpose of
delivering the letter but a thing which every jealous and loving soul
will comprehend to see there she had waited for marius or at least
for courfeyrac still for the purpose of seeing when courfeyrac had
told her we are going to the barricades an idea flashed through her
mind to fling herself into that death as she would have done into any
other and to thrust marius into it also she had followed courfeyrac
had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of
construction and quite certain since marius had received no warning
and since she had intercepted the letter that he would go at dusk to
his trysting place for every evening she had betaken herself to the rue
plumet had there awaited marius and had sent him in the name of his
friends the appeal which would she thought lead him to the barricade
she reckoned on marius despair when he should fail to find cosette she
was not mistaken she had returned to the rue de la chanvrerie herself
what she did there the reader has just seen she died with the tragic
joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death
and who say no one shall have him
marius covered cosettes letter with kisses so she loved him for one
moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now then
he said to himself she is going away her father is taking her to
england and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage nothing
is changed in our fates dreamers like marius are subject to supreme
attacks of dejection and desperate resolves are the result the fatigue
of living is insupportable death is sooner over with then he reflected
that he had still two duties to fulfil to inform cosette of his
death and send her a final farewell and to save from the impending
catastrophe which was in preparation that poor child eponines brother
he had a pocket book about him the same one which had contained
the note book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for
cosette he tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil
our marriage was impossible i asked my grandfather he refused i have
no fortune neither hast thou i hastened to thee thou wert no longer
there thou knowest the promise that i gave thee i shall keep it i
die i love thee when thou readest this my soul will be near thee and
having nothing wherewith to seal this letter he contented himself with
folding the paper in four and added the address
to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent at m fauchelevents rue de
having folded the letter he stood in thought for a moment drew out
his pocket book again opened it and wrote with the same pencil these
my name is marius pontmercy carry my body to my grandfather m
gillenormand rue des filles du calvaire no 6 in the marais
he put his pocketbook back in his pocket then he called gavroche
the gamin at the sound of marius voice ran up to him with his merry
anything said gavroche good god if it had not been for you i
take it leave the barricade instantly gavroche began to scratch his
ear uneasily and to morrow morning you will deliver it at its address
to mademoiselle cosette at m fauchelevents rue de lhomme arme no
well but in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken and i shall
the barricade will not be attacked until daybreak according to all
appearances and will not be taken before to morrow noon
the fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade
had in fact been prolonged it was one of those intermissions which
frequently occur in nocturnal combats which are always followed by an
well said gavroche what if i were to go and carry your letter
it will be too late the barricade will probably be blockaded all
the streets will be guarded and you will not be able to get out go at
gavroche could think of no reply to this and stood there in indecision
all at once he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements
and he started off at a run through mondetour lane
an idea had occurred to gavroche which had brought him to a decision
but he had not mentioned it for fear that marius might offer some
it is barely midnight the rue de lhomme arme is not far off i will
go and deliver the letter at once and i shall get back in time
what are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections
of the soul man is a depth still greater than the people jean valjean
at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval every sort of
gulf had opened again within him he also was trembling like paris
on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution a few hours
had sufficed to bring this about his destiny and his conscience had
suddenly been covered with gloom of him also as well as of paris it
might have been said two principles are face to face the white angel
and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the
abyss which of the two will hurl the other over who will carry the
on the evening preceding this same 5th of june jean valjean
accompanied by cosette and toussaint had installed himself in the rue de
cosette had not quitted the rue plumet without making an effort at
resistance for the first time since they had lived side by side
cosettes will and the will of jean valjean had proved to be distinct
and had been in opposition at least if they had not clashed there had
been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other the abrupt
advice leave your house hurled at jean valjean by a stranger had
alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory he thought that
he had been traced and followed cosette had been obliged to give way
both had arrived in the rue de lhomme arme without opening their lips
and without uttering a word each being absorbed in his own personal
preoccupation jean valjean so uneasy that he did not notice cosettes
sadness cosette so sad that she did not notice jean valjeans
jean valjean had taken toussaint with him a thing which he had never
done in his previous absences he perceived the possibility of not
returning to the rue plumet and he could neither leave toussaint behind
nor confide his secret to her besides he felt that she was devoted and
trustworthy treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity
now toussaint as though she had been destined to be jean valjeans
servant was not curious she stammered in her peasant dialect of
barneville i am made so i do my work the rest is no affair of mine
in this departure from the rue plumet which had been almost a flight
jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise
baptized by cosette the inseparable full trunks would have required
porters and porters are witnesses a fiacre had been summoned to the
door on the rue de babylone and they had taken their departure
it was with difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to pack up
a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles cosette had taken
jean valjean with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of
this departure had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only
at dusk which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius
they had arrived in the rue de lhomme arme after night had fully
the lodgings in the rue de lhomme arme were situated on a back
court on the second floor and were composed of two sleeping rooms a
dining room and a kitchen adjoining the dining room with a garret
where there was a folding bed and which fell to toussaints share the
dining room was an antechamber as well and separated the two bedrooms
the apartment was provided with all necessary utensils
people re acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it human nature
is so constituted hardly had jean valjean reached the rue de lhomme
arme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated there
are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind
an obscure street peaceable inhabitants jean valjean experienced an
indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris
which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse
beam placed on two posts which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the
clamorous city dimly lighted at mid day and is so to speak incapable
of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old which hold
their peace like ancients as they are there was a touch of stagnant
oblivion in that street jean valjean drew his breath once more there
his first care was to place the inseparable beside him
he slept well night brings wisdom we may add night soothes on the
following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay he thought the
dining room charming though it was hideous furnished with an old round
table a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror a dilapidated
arm chair and several plain chairs which were encumbered with
toussaints packages in one of these packages jean valjeans uniform of
a national guard was visible through a rent
as for cosette she had had toussaint take some broth to her room and
about five oclock toussaint who was going and coming and busying
herself with the tiny establishment set on the table a cold chicken
which cosette out of deference to her father consented to glance at
that done cosette under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache
had bade jean valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber
jean valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite and
with his elbows on the table having gradually recovered his serenity
had regained possession of his sense of security
while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice
noticed in a confused way toussaints stammering words as she said
to him monsieur there is something going on they are fighting in
paris but absorbed in a throng of inward calculations he had paid no
heed to it to tell the truth he had not heard her he rose and began
to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door
with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts not
that he was troubled by this headache a little nervous crisis a young
girls fit of sulks the cloud of a moment there would be nothing left
of it in a day or two but he meditated on the future and as was his
habit he thought of it with pleasure after all he saw no obstacle to
their happy life resuming its course at certain hours everything seems
impossible at others everything appears easy jean valjean was in the
midst of one of these good hours they generally succeed the bad
ones as day follows night by virtue of that law of succession and
of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature and which
superficial minds call antithesis in this peaceful street where he had
taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him
for some time past this very fact that he had seen many shadows made
him begin to perceive a little azure to have quitted the rue
plumet without complications or incidents was one good step already
accomplished perhaps it would be wise to go abroad if only for a few
months and to set out for london well they would go what difference
did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he
had cosette beside him cosette was his nation cosette sufficed for
his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for cosettes
happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever
and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind he was in a
state of collapse from all his past sufferings and he was fully entered
on optimism cosette was by his side she seemed to be his an optical
illusion which every one has experienced he arranged in his own mind
with all sorts of felicitous devices his departure for england with
cosette and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased
as he paced to and fro with long strides his glance suddenly
in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard he saw
my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we
shall be this evening in the rue de lhomme arme no 7 in a week we
cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting book on the sideboard in
front of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had
forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left
it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to
dry the four lines which she had penned and which she had given in
charge of the young workman in the rue plumet the writing had been
the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical image so
that the writing reversed on the blotter was righted in the mirror and
presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes
the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening
jean valjean stepped up to the mirror he read the four lines again but
he did not believe them they produced on him the effect of appearing in
a flash of lightning it was a hallucination it was impossible it was
little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at
cosettes blotting book and the consciousness of the reality returned
to him he caught up the blotter and said it comes from there
he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the
reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl and he saw no
sense in it then he said to himself but this signifies nothing there
is nothing written here and he drew a long breath with inexpressible
relief who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants
the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all
he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight
almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the
dupe all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he
beheld the vision there were the four lines outlined with inexorable
clearness this time it was no mirage the recurrence of a vision is a
reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in the mirror he
jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old
arm chair beside the buffet with drooping head and glassy eyes in
utter bewilderment he told himself that it was plain that the light of
the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that
to some one then he heard his soul which had become terrible once
more give vent to a dull roar in the gloom try then the effect of
taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage
strange and sad to say at that very moment marius had not yet received
cosettes letter chance had treacherously carried it to jean valjean
before delivering it to marius up to that day jean valjean had not
been vanquished by trial he had been subjected to fearful proofs no
violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed
with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey
and had raged against him he had accepted every extremity when it had
been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man
had yielded up his liberty risked his head lost everything suffered
everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a
point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a
martyr his conscience inured to every assault of destiny might have
appeared to be forever impregnable well any one who had beheld his
spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at
that moment it was because of all the tortures which he had undergone
in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him
this was the most terrible never had such pincers seized him hitherto
he felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities he felt
the plucking at the strange chord alas the supreme trial let us say
rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being
poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than as
a father but we have already remarked above that into this paternity
the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love he
loved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he
loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to
love or a wife as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest that
sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the
rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious
celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct
less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real
attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness
for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and
let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already
indicated no marriage was possible between them not even that of
souls and yet it is certain that their destinies were wedded with the
exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood
jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of
that which may be loved the passions and loves which succeed each other
had not produced in him those successive green growths tender green or
dark green which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter
and in men who pass fifty in short and we have insisted on it more
than once all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum
total was a lofty virtue ended in rendering jean valjean a father to
cosette a strange father forged from the grandfather the son the
brother and the husband that existed in jean valjean a father in whom
there was included even a mother a father who loved cosette and adored
her and who held that child as his light his home his family his
thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come that she was escaping
from him that she was slipping from his hands that she was gliding
from him like a cloud like water when he had before his eyes this
crushing proof another is the goal of her heart another is the wish
of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anything but her
father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he
said to himself she is going away from me the grief which he felt
surpassed the bounds of possibility to have done all that he had done
for the purpose of ending like this and the very idea of being nothing
then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from
head to foot he felt even in the very roots of his hair the immense
reawakening of egotism and the i in this mans abyss howled
there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil a
despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting
aside and breaking certain profound elements which in some cases are
the very man himself grief when it attains this shape is a headlong
flight of all the forces of the conscience these are fatal crises few
among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty when
the limit of endurance is overstepped the most imperturbable virtue is
disconcerted jean valjean took the blotter again and convinced himself
afresh he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes
over those four unobjectionable lines and there arose within him such
a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was
he examined this revelation athwart the exaggerations of revery with
an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when a
mans calmness reaches the coldness of the statue
he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his
having a suspicion of the fact he recalled his fears of the preceding
summer so foolishly dissipated he recognized the precipice it was
still the same only jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at
the unprecedented and heart rending thing about it was that he had
fallen without perceiving it all the light of his life had departed
while he still fancied that he beheld the sun
his instinct did not hesitate he put together certain circumstances
certain dates certain blushes and certain pallors on cosettes part
and he said to himself it is he
the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses
its aim he struck marius with his first conjecture he did not know the
name but he found the man instantly he distinctly perceived in the
background of the implacable conjuration of his memories the unknown
prowler of the luxembourg that wretched seeker of love adventures that
idler of romance that idiot that coward for it is cowardly to come
and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves
after he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at
the bottom of this situation and that everything proceeded from that
quarter he jean valjean the regenerated man the man who had so
labored over his soul the man who had made so many efforts to resolve
all life all misery and all unhappiness into love looked into his own
great griefs contain something of dejection they discourage one with
existence the man into whom they enter feels something within him
withdraw from him in his youth their visits are lugubrious later on
they are sinister alas if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is
hot when the hair is black when the head is erect on the body like
the flame on the torch when the roll of destiny still retains its full
thickness when the heart full of desirable love still possesses beats
which can be returned to it when one has time for redress when all
women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before
one when the force of life is complete what is it in old age when
the years hasten on growing ever paler to that twilight hour when one
begins to behold the stars of the tomb
while he was meditating toussaint entered jean valjean rose and asked
in what quarter is it do you know
toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him
jean valjean began again did you not tell me that just now that there
ah yes sir replied toussaint it is in the direction of
there is a mechanical movement which comes to us unconsciously from
the most profound depths of our thought it was no doubt under
the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly
conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the
bareheaded he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house he
chapter ii the street urchin an enemy of light
how long did he remain thus what was the ebb and flow of this tragic
meditation did he straighten up did he remain bowed had he been
bent to breaking could he still rise and regain his footing in his
conscience upon something solid he probably would not have been able to
the street was deserted a few uneasy bourgeois who were rapidly
returning home hardly saw him each one for himself in times of peril
the lamp lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated
precisely opposite the door of no 7 and then went away jean valjean
would not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined
him in that shadow he sat there on the post of his door motionless as
a form of ice there is congealment in despair the alarm bells and
a vague and stormy uproar were audible in the midst of all these
convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of saint paul
struck eleven gravely and without haste for the tocsin is man the
hour is god the passage of the hour produced no effect on jean valjean
jean valjean did not stir still at about that moment a brusque report
burst forth in the direction of the halles a second yet more violent
followed it was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la
chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by marius at this double
discharge whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean
valjean started he rose turning towards the quarter whence the noise
proceeded then he fell back upon the post again folded his arms and
his head slowly sank on his bosom again
all at once he raised his eyes some one was walking in the street he
heard steps near him he looked and by the light of the lanterns in
the direction of the street which ran into the rue aux archives he
gavroche had just arrived in the rue lhomme arme
gavroche was staring into the air apparently in search of something he
saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him
gavroche after staring into the air stared below he raised himself on
tiptoe and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor they were
all shut bolted and padlocked after having authenticated the fronts
of five or six barricaded houses in this manner the urchin shrugged his
shoulders and took himself to task in these terms
then he began to stare into the air again
jean valjean who an instant previously in his then state of mind
would not have spoken to or even answered any one felt irresistibly
what is the matter with you my little fellow he said
the matter with me is that i am hungry replied gavroche frankly and
jean valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five franc piece
but gavroche who was of the wagtail species and who skipped
vivaciously from one gesture to another had just picked up a stone he
see here said he you still have your lanterns here you are
disobeying the regulations my friend this is disorderly smash that
and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with
such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the
opposite house cried there is ninety three come again
the lantern oscillated violently and went out the street had suddenly
thats right old street ejaculated gavroche put on your
what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end
of the street its the archives isnt it i must crumble up those big
stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them
poor creature he said in a low tone and speaking to himself he is
and he laid the hundred sou piece in his hand
gavroche raised his face astonished at the size of this sou he stared
at it in the darkness and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him
he knew five franc pieces by hearsay their reputation was agreeable to
him he was delighted to see one close to he said
he gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy then turning to jean
valjean he held out the coin to him and said majestically to him
bourgeois i prefer to smash lanterns take back your ferocious beast
you cant bribe me that has got five claws but it doesnt scratch me
well returned jean valjean keep the money for your mother
gavroche was touched moreover he had just noticed that the man who was
addressing him had no hat and this inspired him with confidence
truly said he so it wasnt to keep me from breaking the lanterns
and he put the five franc piece into one of his pockets
can you tell me where no 7 is
here the child paused he feared that he had said too much he thrust
his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with
an idea flashed through jean valjeans mind anguish does have these
are you the person who is bringing a letter that i am expecting
you said gavroche you are not a woman
the letter is for mademoiselle cosette is it not
cosette muttered gavroche yes i believe that is the queer name
well resumed jean valjean i am the person to whom you are to
in that case you must know that i was sent from the barricade
gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a
respect for despatches said he it comes from the provisional
gavroche held the paper elevated above his head
dont go and fancy its a love letter it is for a woman but its for
the people we men fight and we respect the fair sex we are not as
they are in fine society where there are lions who send chickens55 to
after all continued gavroche you have the air of an honest man
and he handed the paper to jean valjean
and make haste monsieur whats your name for mamselle cosette is
gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark
is it to saint merry that the answer is to be sent
there you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called
brioches blunders this letter comes from the barricade of the rue de
la chanvrerie and im going back there good evening citizen
that said gavroche took himself off or to describe it more exactly
fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like
that of an escaped bird he plunged back into the gloom as though he
made a hole in it with the rigid rapidity of a projectile the alley of
lhomme arme became silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that
strange child who had about him something of the shadow and of the
dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses and
was lost there like smoke in the dark and one might have thought that
he had dissipated and vanished had there not taken place a few minutes
after his disappearance a startling shiver of glass and had not the
magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more
abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois it was gavroche upon his way
chapter iii while cosette and toussaint are asleep
jean valjean went into the house with marius letter
he groped his way up the stairs as pleased with the darkness as an owl
who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see
whether he could hear any noise made sure that to all appearances
cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches
into the bottle of the fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark so
greatly did his hand tremble what he had just done smacked of theft at
last the candle was lighted he leaned his elbows on the table unfolded
in violent emotions one does not read one flings to the earth so to
speak the paper which one holds one clutches it like a victim one
crushes it one digs into it the nails of ones wrath or of ones joy
one hastens to the end one leaps to the beginning attention is at
fever heat it takes up in the gross as it were the essential points
it seizes on one point and the rest disappears in marius note to
i die when thou readest this my soul will be near thee
in the presence of these two lines he was horribly dazzled he remained
for a moment crushed as it were by the change of emotion which
was taking place within him he stared at marius note with a sort of
intoxicated amazement he had before his eyes that splendor the death
he uttered a frightful cry of inward joy so it was all over the
catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope the being who
obstructed his destiny was disappearing that man had taken himself off
of his own accord freely willingly this man was going to his death
and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through
no fault of his perhaps even he is already dead here his fever
entered into calculations no he is not dead yet the letter had
evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning
after the two discharges that were heard between eleven oclock and
midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be
attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from
the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is
caught in the gearing jean valjean felt himself delivered so he was
about to find himself alone with cosette once more the rivalry would
cease the future was beginning again he had but to keep this note in
his pocket cosette would never know what had become of that man all
that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course
this man cannot escape if he is not already dead it is certain that he
having said all this to himself he became gloomy
then he went down stairs and woke up the porter
about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of
a national guard and with his arms the porter had easily found in the
neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment he had a loaded
gun and a cartridge box filled with cartridges
he strode off in the direction of the markets
in the meantime gavroche had had an adventure
gavroche after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the rue du
chaume entered the rue des vielles haudriettes and not seeing even a
cat there he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the
song of which he was capable his march far from being retarded by his
singing was accelerated by it he began to sow along the sleeping or
gavroche as he sang was lavish of his pantomime gesture is the strong
point of the refrain his face an inexhaustible repertory of masks
produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a
cloth torn in a high gale unfortunately as he was alone and as it was
night this was neither seen nor even visible such wastes of riches do
his feline eye had just descried in the recess of a carriage door
what is called in painting an ensemble that is to say a person and
a thing the thing was a hand cart the person was a man from auvergene
the shafts of the cart rested on the pavement and the auvergnats head
was supported against the front of the cart his body was coiled up on
this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground
gavroche with his experience of the things of this world recognized
a drunken man he was some corner errand man who had drunk too much and
there now thought gavroche thats what the summer nights are good
for well take the cart for the republic and leave the auvergnat for
his mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light
how bully that cart would look on our barricade
gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind and at the auvergnat
from the front that is to say by the feet and at the expiration of
another minute the imperturbable auvergnat was reposing flat on the
gavroche habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters had
everything about him he fumbled in one of his pockets and pulled from
it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter
that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring
auvergnats velvet vest seized the cart shafts in both hands and set
off in the direction of the halles pushing the cart before him at a
hard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar
this was perilous there was a post at the royal printing establishment
gavroche did not think of this this post was occupied by the national
guards of the suburbs the squad began to wake up and heads were raised
from camp beds two street lanterns broken in succession that ditty
sung at the top of the lungs this was a great deal for those cowardly
streets which desire to go to sleep at sunset and which put the
extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour for the last hour
that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement
the uproar of a fly in a bottle the sergeant of the banlieue lent an
ear he waited he was a prudent man
the mad rattle of the cart filled to overflowing the possible measure
of waiting and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance
theres a whole band of them there said he let us proceed gently
it was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that
and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread
all at once gavroche pushing his cart in front of him and at the very
moment when he was about to turn into the rue des vielles haudriettes
found himself face to face with a uniform a shako a plume and a gun
hullo said he its him good day public order
gavroches amazement was always brief and speedily thawed
where are you going you rascal shouted the sergeant
citizen retorted gavroche i havent called you bourgeois yet why
monsieur retorted gavroche perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday
i ask you where are you going you villain
you speak prettily really no one would suppose you as old as you are
you ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece that would
where are you going where are you going where are you going bandit
what villainous words you must wipe your mouth better the first time
will you tell me where you are going you wretch
general said gavroche im on my way to look for a doctor for my wife
the master stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the
very means that have ruined them gavroche took in the whole situation
at a glance it was the cart which had told against him it was the
at the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent
on gavroche the cart converted into a projectile and launched with all
the latters might rolled down upon him furiously and the sergeant
struck full in the stomach tumbled over backwards into the gutter while
the men of the post had rushed out pell mell at the sergeants shout
the shot brought on a general random discharge after which they
this blind mans buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and
in the meanwhile gavroche who had retraced his steps at full speed
halted five or six streets distant and seated himself panting on the
stone post which forms the corner of the enfants rouges
after panting for a few minutes he turned in the direction where the
fusillade was raging lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and
thrust it forward three times as he slapped the back of his head with
his right hand an imperious gesture in which parisian street urchindom
has condensed french irony and which is evidently efficacious since it
this gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection
yes said he im splitting with laughter im twisting with
delight i abound in joy but im losing my way i shall have to take a
roundabout way if i only reach the barricade in season
thereupon he set out again on a run
ah by the way where was i said he
and he resumed his ditty as he plunged rapidly through the streets and
this is what died away in the gloom
