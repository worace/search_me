to break down doors one of them had made himself a dagger of a
stocking weavers hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the
stump another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed
for three days a carpenter named lombier met a comrade who asked him
whither are you going eh well i have no weapons what then
im going to my timber yard to get my compasses what for i dont
know said lombier a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted
some passing artisans come here you he treated them to ten sous
worth of wine and said have you work no go to filspierre
between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil and you will
find work at filspierres they found cartridges and arms certain
well known leaders were going the rounds that is to say running from
one house to another to collect their men at barthelemys near the
barriere du trone at capels near the petit chapeau the drinkers
accosted each other with a grave air they were heard to say have you
your pistol under my blouse and you under my shirt in the
rue traversiere in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of
the maison brulee in front of tool maker berniers groups whispered
together among them was observed a certain mavot who never remained
more than a week in one shop as the masters always discharged him
because they were obliged to dispute with him every day mavot was
killed on the following day at the barricade of the rue menilmontant
pretot who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavot
and to the question what is your object he replied insurrection
workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de bercy waited for a
certain lemarin the revolutionary agent for the faubourg saint marceau
on the 5th of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general
lamarques funeral procession traversed paris with official military
pomp somewhat augmented through precaution two battalions with draped
drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords
at their sides escorted the coffin the hearse was drawn by young men
the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel
branches then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the
sectionaries of the friends of the people the law school the medical
school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german
and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of
banner children waving green boughs stone cutters and carpenters who
were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their
paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly
all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order
and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous rout again a column
squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair of pistols in
full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated
before him on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the
trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men
women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety an armed throng
was passing and a terrified throng looked on
the government on its side was taking observations it observed with
its hand on its sword four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in
the place louis xv in their saddles with their trumpets at their head
cartridge boxes filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march
in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guard
echelonned from street to street at the halle aux vins a squadron of
dragoons at the greve half of the 12th light infantry the other
half being at the bastille the 6th dragoons at the celestins and the
courtyard of the louvre full of artillery the remainder of the troops
were confined to their barracks without reckoning the regiments of the
environs of paris power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing
multitude twenty four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand
divers reports were in circulation in the cortege legitimist tricks
were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reichstadt whom god had marked
out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating
him for the empire one personage whose name has remained unknown
announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over
would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people that
which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those
present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection here and there also in
that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were
visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said let
us plunder there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of
marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water a phenomenon to
the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the
deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille it rained
from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng many
incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at
the duc de fitz james who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his
head the gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire
a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the porte saint martin
an officer of the 12th light infantry saying aloud i am a republican
the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain
at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique long live the
republic marked the passage of the funeral train at the bastille
long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the
faubourg saint antoine effected a junction with the procession and a
certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng
one man was heard to say to another do you see that fellow with a
red beard hes the one who will give the word when we are to fire it
appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quenisset
the hearse passed the bastille traversed the small bridge and reached
the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz there it halted the crowd
surveyed at that moment with a birdseye view would have presented the
aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread
out over the quai bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on
the boulevard as far as the porte saint martin a circle was traced
around the hearse the vast rout held their peace lafayette spoke and
bade lamarque farewell this was a touching and august instant all
all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance
in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with a pike
surmounted with a red liberty cap lafayette turned aside his head
this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it from
the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamors
which resemble billows stirred the multitude two prodigious shouts went
up lamarque to the pantheon lafayette to the town hall some young
men amid the declamations of the throng harnessed themselves and
began to drag lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and
lafayette in a hackney coach along the quai morland
in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed
that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a centenarian
afterwards who had also been in the war of 1776 and who had fought at
trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette
in the meantime the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set
in motion and came to bar the bridge on the right bank the dragoons
emerged from the celestins and deployed along the quai morland the men
who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner
of the quay and shouted the dragoons the dragoons advanced at a
walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in
their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air
they halted two hundred paces from the little bridge the carriage in
which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it
to pass and then closed behind it at that moment the dragoons and the
crowd touched the women fled in terror what took place during that
fatal minute no one can say it is the dark moment when two clouds come
together some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was
heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a dagger
was given by a child to a dragoon the fact is that three shots were
suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron
the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her
window the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed
they are beginning too soon and all at once a squadron of dragoons
which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to debouch
at a gallop with bared swords through the rue bassompierre and the
then all is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade
breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and
pass the small arm of the seine now filled in the timber yards of the
isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants
stakes are torn up pistol shots fired a barricade begun the young men
who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run
and the municipal guard the carabineers rush up the dragoons ply their
swords the crowd disperses in all directions a rumor of war flies to
all four quarters of paris men shout to arms they run tumble down
flee resist wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire
nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot
everything bursts forth everywhere at once was it foreseen yes was it
prepared no whence comes it from the pavements whence falls it from
the clouds here insurrection assumes the character of a plot there
of an improvisation the first comer seizes a current of the throng
and leads it whither he wills a beginning full of terror in which is
mingled a sort of formidable gayety first come clamors the shops are
closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated
shots people flee blows from gun stocks beat against portes cocheres
servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying
a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place
at twenty different spots in paris at once
in the rue sainte croix de la bretonnerie twenty young men bearded and
with long hair entered a dram shop and emerged a moment later carrying
a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape and having at their
head three men armed one with a sword one with a gun and the third
in the rue des nonaindieres a very well dressed bourgeois who had a
prominent belly a sonorous voice a bald head a lofty brow a black
beard and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat offered
in the rue saint pierre montmartre men with bare arms carried about a
black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription
republic or death in the rue des jeuneurs rue du cadran rue
montorgueil rue mandar groups appeared waving flags on which could be
distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number one of
these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of
they pillaged a factory of small arms on the boulevard saint martin and
three armorers shops the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the
rue michel le comte the other in the rue du temple in a few minutes
the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred
and thirty guns nearly all double barrelled sixty four swords and
eighty three pistols in order to provide more arms one man took the
opposite the quai de la greve young men armed with muskets installed
themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing one
of them had a flint lock they rang entered and set about making
cartridges one of these women relates i did not know what cartridges
were it was my husband who told me
one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vielles
the body of a mason who had been killed by a gun shot lay in the rue de
and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the
boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting
men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and
shouted to arms broke street lanterns unharnessed carriages
unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees
rummaged cellars rolled out hogsheads heaped up paving stones rough
they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this they entered the
dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords and guns
of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the
arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for
the guns and swords and said send for them to morrow at the mayors
office they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in
the streets on their way to the townhall they tore the epaulets from
officers in the rue du cimitiere saint nicholas an officer of the
national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils
took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to
in the quartier saint jacques the students swarmed out of their
hotels and ascended the rue saint hyacinthe to the cafe du progress
or descended to the cafe des sept billards in the rue des mathurins
there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone
corner posts distributed arms they plundered the timber yard in the
rue transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades on a single
point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue sainte avoye
and the rue simon le franc where they destroyed the barricade with
their own hands at a single point the insurgents yielded they
abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on
a detachment of the national guard and fled through the rue de la
corderie the detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag a
package of cartridges and three hundred pistol balls the national
guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the
all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place
simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult
like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder in less than
an hour twenty seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter
of the halles alone in the centre was that famous house no 50 which
was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which
flanked on the one hand by a barricade at saint merry and on the other
by a barricade of the rue maubuee commanded three streets the rue
des arcis the rue saint martin and the rue aubry le boucher which
it faced the barricades at right angles fell back the one of the
rue montorgueil on the grande truanderie the other of the rue
geoffroy langevin on the rue sainte avoye without reckoning innumerable
barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at
mont sainte genevieve one in the rue menilmontant where was visible
a porte cochere torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of
the hotel dieu made with an ecossais which had been unharnessed and
overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police
at the barricade of the rue des menetriers a well dressed man
distributed money to the workmen at the barricade of the rue grenetat
a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be
the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of
silver here said he this is to pay expenses wine et caetera
a light haired young man without a cravat went from barricade to
barricade carrying pass words another with a naked sword a blue
police cap on his head placed sentinels in the interior beyond the
barricades the wine shops and porters lodges were converted into
guard houses otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific
military tactics the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles
and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in
particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest the
society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to
direct the insurrection in the quartier sainte avoye a man killed in
the rue du ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of paris
that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a
sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air the insurrection
had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized
nearly all the posts of the garrison in less than three hours like a
train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied
on the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the
whole of the marais the popincourt arms manufactory la galiote the
chateau deau and all the streets near the halles on the left bank
the barracks of the veterans sainte pelagie the place maubert the
powder magazine of the deux moulins and all the barriers at five
oclock in the evening they were masters of the bastille of the
lingerie of the blancs manteaux their scouts had reached the place
des victoires and menaced the bank the petits peres barracks and the
post office a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters
the conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points and as a
result of the disarming domiciliary visits and armorers shops hastily
invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of
about six oclock in the evening the passage du saumon became the field
of battle the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other
they fired from one gate to the other an observer a dreamer the
author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano
found himself in the passage between the two fires all that he had to
protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which
separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly
meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in
haste the legions emerged from the mayoralities the regiments from
their barracks opposite the passage de lancre a drummer received a
blow from a dagger another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty
young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword another was
killed in the rue grenier saint lazare in the rue michelle comte three
officers fell dead one after the other many of the municipal guards on
being wounded in the rue des lombards retreated
in front of the cour batave a detachment of national guards found a red
flag bearing the following inscription republican revolution no 127
the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable
there was the hearth there evidently was the question all the rest
was nothing but skirmishes the proof that all would be decided there
lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet
in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the
fearful uncertainty of the crisis they recalled the popular ovation
which had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the line in july 1830
two intrepid men tried in great wars the marshal lobau and general
bugeaud were in command bugeaud under lobau enormous patrols
composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the
national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf
of office went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion the insurgents
on their side placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces and
audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades each side was
watching the other the government with an army in its hand hesitated
the night was almost upon them and the saint merry tocsin began to make
itself heard the minister of war at that time marshal soult who had
seen austerlitz regarded this with a gloomy air
these old sailors accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having as
resource and guide only tactics that compass of battles are utterly
disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public
the national guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder a
battalion of the 12th light came at a run from saint denis the 14th of
the line arrived from courbevoie the batteries of the military school
had taken up their position on the carrousel cannons were descending
solitude was formed around the tuileries louis philippe was perfectly
during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more
than one insurrection nothing is generally more singularly calm than
the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of
the rebellious quarters paris very speedily accustoms herself to
anything it is only a riot and paris has so many affairs on hand
that she does not put herself out for so small a matter these colossal
cities alone can offer such spectacles these immense enclosures alone
can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable
tranquillity ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the
shop keeper hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he
there appears to be a squabble in the rue saint martin
later on when the heart rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and
firing by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says
a moment later the riot approaches and gains in force he shuts up his
shop precipitately hastily dons his uniform that is to say he places
his merchandise in safety and risks his own person
men fire in a square in a passage in a blind alley they take and
re take the barricade blood flows the grape shot riddles the fronts
of the houses the balls kill people in their beds corpses encumber the
streets a few streets away the shock of billiard balls can be heard in
the theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh
and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with
war hackney carriages go their way passers by are going to a dinner
somewhere in town sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is
in 1831 a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass
at the time of the insurrection of 1839 in the rue saint martin a
little infirm old man pushing a hand cart surmounted by a tricolored
rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and
came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering
his glasses of cocoa impartially now to the government now to
nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings
in paris which cannot be found in any other capital to this end two
things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety the city of
on this occasion however in the resort to arms of june 25th 1832 the
great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself it
closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the
most distant and most disinterested quarters the courageous took to
arms the poltroons hid the busy and heedless passer by disappeared
many streets were empty at four oclock in the morning
alarming details were hawked about fatal news was disseminated that
they were masters of the bank that there were six hundred of them
in the cloister of saint merry alone entrenched and embattled in the
church that the line was not to be depended on that armand carrel
had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said get a
regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them
nevertheless i am with you i will follow you wherever there is room
for a chair that one must be on ones guard that at night there would
be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris
there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with
the government was recognizable that a battery had been established
in the rue aubry le boucher that lobau and bugeaud were putting their
heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four
columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the
first coming from the bastille the second from the porte saint martin
the third from the greve the fourth from the halles that perhaps
also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars
that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was
people busied themselves over marshal soults hesitations why did not
he attack at once it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed the
old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom
evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with
an air of irritation passers by were searched suspicious persons were
arrested by nine oclock more than eight hundred persons had been
arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the
at the conciergerie in particular the long vault which is called the
rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap
of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly
all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy
shower elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled
anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual
people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were
uneasy nothing was to be heard but this ah my god he has not come
home there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be
people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the
tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were
said it is cavalry or those are the caissons galloping to the
trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable
they waited for the first cannon shot men sprang up at the corners of
the streets and disappeared shouting go home and people made haste
to bolt their doors they said how will all this end from moment to
moment in proportion as the darkness descended paris seemed to take on
a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt
book eleventh the atom fraternizes with the hurricane
chapter i some explanations with regard to the origin of gavroches
poetry the influence of an academician on this poetry
at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the
populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement
in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the
hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed
so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb
the rout was shaken their ranks were broken all ran fled made their
escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight
the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling
overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred
streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose
at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the rue
menilmontant holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which
he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old
holster pistol in the show window of a bric a brac merchants shop
mother whats your name im going to borrow your machine
two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing
through the rue amelot and the rue basse encountered the lad
it was little gavroche on his way to the wars
on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger
who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march
and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion we
know not who does know himself perhaps however gavroche was well
up in all the popular tunes in circulation and he mingled with them his
own chirpings an observing urchin and a rogue he made a potpourri of
the voices of nature and the voices of paris he combined the repertory
of the birds with the repertory of the workshops he was acquainted with
thieves a tribe contiguous to his own he had it appears been
for three months apprenticed to a printer he had one day executed a
commission for m baour lormian one of the forty gavroche was a gamin
moreover gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered
the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously
rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of
providence his brothers in the evening his father in the morning
that is what his night had been like on quitting the rue des ballets
at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically
extracted from it the two brats had shared with them some sort of
breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding
them to that good mother the street who had brought him up almost
entirely on leaving them he had appointed to meet them at the same
spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a
farewell i break a cane otherwise expressed i cut my stick or as
they say at the court i file off if you dont find papa and mamma
young uns come back here this evening ill scramble you up some
supper and ill give you a shakedown the two children picked up by
some policeman and placed in the refuge or stolen by some mountebank
or having simply strayed off in that immense chinese puzzle of a paris
did not return the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of
these lost traces gavroche did not see them again ten or twelve weeks
had elapsed since that night more than once he had scratched the back
of his head and said where the devil are my two children
in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du
pont aux choux he noticed that there was but one shop open in that
street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a pastry cooks
shop this presented a providential occasion to eat another
apple turnover before entering the unknown gavroche halted fumbled in
his fob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even a sou
it is hard to miss the last cake
two minutes later he was in the rue saint louis while traversing the
rue du parc royal he felt called upon to make good the loss of the
apple turnover which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the
immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight
a little further on on catching sight of a group of comfortable looking
persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders
and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as
how fat those moneyed men are theyre drunk they just wallow in good
dinners ask em what they do with their money they dont know they
eat it thats what they do as much as their bellies will hold
the brandishing of a triggerless pistol grasped in ones hand in the
open street is so much of a public function that gavroche felt his
fervor increasing with every moment amid the scraps of the marseillaise
all goes well i suffer a great deal in my left paw im all broken
up with rheumatism but im satisfied citizens all that the bourgeois
have to do is to bear themselves well ill sneeze them out subversive
couplets what are the police spies dogs and id just like to have
one of them at the end of my pistol im just from the boulevard my
friends its getting hot there its getting into a little boil its
simmering its time to skim the pot forward march men let an impure
blood inundate the furrows i give my days to my country i shall never
see my concubine more nini finished yes nini but never mind long
live joy lets fight crebleu ive had enough of despotism
at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having
fallen gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement and picked up the
man then he assisted in raising the horse after which he picked up his
pistol and resumed his way in the rue de thorigny all was peace and
silence this apathy peculiar to the marais presented a contrast with
the vast surrounding uproar four gossips were chatting in a doorway
scotland has trios of witches paris has quartettes of old gossiping
hags and the thou shalt be king could be quite as mournfully hurled
at bonaparte in the carrefour baudoyer as at macbeth on the heath of
the gossips of the rue de thorigny busied themselves only with their own
concerns three of them were portresses and the fourth was a rag picker
all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age
the rag picker was humble in this open air society it is the
rag picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes this is caused
by the corner for refuse which is fat or lean according to the will of
the portresses and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap there
this rag picker was a grateful creature and she smiled with what a
smile on the three portresses things of this nature were said
ah by the way is your cat still cross
good gracious cats are naturally the enemies of dogs you know its
but the fleas from a cat dont go after people
thats not the trouble dogs are dangerous i remember one year
when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the
newspapers that was at the time when there were at the tuileries great
sheep that drew the little carriage of the king of rome do you remember
i knew louis xviii i prefer louis xviii
meat is awfully dear isnt it mother patagon
ah dont mention it the butchers shop is a horror a horrible
horror one cant afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays
ladies business is dull the refuse heaps are miserable no one throws
there are poorer people than you la vargouleme
ah thats true replied the rag picker with deference i have a
a pause succeeded and the rag picker yielding to that necessity for
boasting which lies at the bottom of man added
in the morning on my return home i pick over my basket i sort my
things this makes heaps in my room i put the rags in a basket the
cores and stalks in a bucket the linen in my cupboard the woollen
stuff in my commode the old papers in the corner of the window
the things that are good to eat in my bowl the bits of glass in my
fireplace the old shoes behind my door and the bones under my bed
gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening
old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics
he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple howl
whats that hes got in his paddle a pistol
well id like to know what sort of a beggars brat this is
that sort of animal is never easy unless hes overturning the
gavroche disdainfully contented himself by way of reprisal with
elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide
the one who answered to the name of patagon clapped her hands together
theres going to be evil doings thats certain the errand boy next
door has a little pointed beard i have seen him pass every day with a
young person in a pink bonnet on his arm to day i saw him pass and
he had a gun on his arm mame bacheux says that last week there was a
revolution at at at wheres the calf at pontoise and then there
you see him that horrid scamp with his pistol it seems that the
celestins are full of pistols what do you suppose the government can
do with good for nothings who dont know how to do anything but contrive
ways of upsetting the world when we had just begun to get a little
quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened good lord to that
poor queen whom i saw pass in the tumbril and all this is going to
make tobacco dearer its infamous and i shall certainly go to see him
youve got the sniffles old lady said gavroche blow your
and he passed on when he was in the rue pavee the rag picker occurred
to his mind and he indulged in this soliloquy
youre in the wrong to insult the revolutionists mother
dust heap corner this pistol is in your interests its so that you may
have more good things to eat in your basket
all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the portress patagon
who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the
oh come now said gavroche i dont care a brass farthing for that
shortly afterwards he passed the hotel lamoignon there he uttered this
and he was seized with a fit of melancholy he gazed at his pistol with
an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it
im going off said he but you wont go off
one dog may distract the attention from another dog45 a very gaunt
poodle came along at the moment gavroche felt compassion for him
my poor doggy said he you must have gone and swallowed a cask for
then he directed his course towards lorme saint gervais
chapter iii just indignation of a hair dresser
the worthy hair dresser who had chased from his shop the two little
fellows to whom gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the
elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old
soldier of the legion who had served under the empire they were
talking the hair dresser had naturally spoken to the veteran of the
riot then of general lamarque and from lamarque they had passed to
the emperor thence sprang up a conversation between barber and
soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with
arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the
how did the emperor ride sir said the barber
badly he did not know how to fall so he never fell
did he have fine horses he must have had fine horses
on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast it was a
racing mare perfectly white her ears were very wide apart her saddle
deep a fine head marked with a black star a very long neck strongly
articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful
crupper a little more than fifteen hands in height
the hair dresser felt that after this observation a short silence
would be fitting so he conformed himself to it and then went on
the emperor was never wounded but once was he sir
the old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who
in the heel at ratisbon i never saw him so well dressed as on that
day he was as neat as a new sou
and you mr veteran you must have been often wounded
i said the soldier ah not to amount to anything at marengo i
received two sabre blows on the back of my neck a bullet in the right
arm at austerlitz another in the left hip at jena at friedland
a thrust from a bayonet there at the moskowa seven or eight
lance thrusts no matter where at lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed
one of my fingers ah and then at waterloo a ball from a biscaien in
how fine that is exclaimed the hair dresser in pindaric accents to
die on the field of battle on my word of honor rather than die in bed
of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs cataplasms
syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a cannon ball in my
he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop the
ah good god he exclaimed its one of them
and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor it was a
the hair dresser ran to the broken window and beheld gavroche fleeing
at the full speed towards the marche saint jean as he passed the
hair dressers shop gavroche who had the two brats still in his mind
had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had
you see shrieked the hair dresser who from white had turned blue
that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it what
chapter iv the child is amazed at the old man
in the meantime in the marche saint jean where the post had already
been disarmed gavroche had just effected a junction with a band led
by enjolras courfeyrac combeferre and feuilly they were armed after
a fashion bahorel and jean prouvaire had found them and swelled the
group enjolras had a double barrelled hunting gun combeferre the gun
of a national guard bearing the number of his legion and in his belt
two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen jean prouvaire
an old cavalry musket bahorel a rifle courfeyrac was brandishing an
unsheathed sword cane feuilly with a naked sword in his hand marched
they reached the quai morland cravatless hatless breathless soaked
by the rain with lightning in their eyes gavroche accosted them
behind feuilly marched or rather bounded bahorel who was like a fish
in water in a riot he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulged in
the sort of words which break everything his waistcoat astounded a
the reds the reds retorted bahorel a queer kind of fear
bourgeois for my part i dont tremble before a poppy the little red
hat inspires me with no alarm take my advice bourgeois lets leave
he caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the
most peaceable sheet of paper in the world a permission to eat eggs a
lenten admonition addressed by the archbishop of paris to his flock
and he tore the charge from the nail this conquered gavroche from that
bahorel observed enjolras you are wrong you should have let that
charge alone he is not the person with whom we have to deal you are
wasting your wrath to no purpose take care of your supply one does not
fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun
each one in his own fashion enjolras retorted bahorel this
bishops prose shocks me i want to eat eggs without being permitted
your style is the hot and cold i am amusing myself besides im not
wasting myself im getting a start and if i tore down that charge
this word hercle struck gavroche he sought all occasions for
learning and that tearer down of posters possessed his esteem he
it means cursed name of a dog in latin
here bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard
who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the a b c he
a fine man thats true said gavroche who now understood latin
a tumultuous retinue accompanied them students artists young men
affiliated to the cougourde of aix artisans longshoremen armed with
clubs and bayonets some like combeferre with pistols thrust into
an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band
he had no arms and he made great haste so that he might not be left
enjolras and his friends had been on the boulevard bourdon near the
public storehouses at the moment when the dragoons had made their
charge enjolras courfeyrac and combeferre were among those who had
taken to the rue bassompierre shouting to the barricades in the rue
lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along what had attracted
their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig zag as though
he were intoxicated moreover he had his hat in his hand although it
had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the
very time courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf he knew him through
having many times accompanied marius as far as his door as he was
acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old
beadle book collector and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst
of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charges almost in
the midst of a fusillade hatless in the rain and strolling about among
the bullets he had accosted him and the following dialogue had been
exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian
thrusts with the sword and firing m mabeuf
that is good where are the rest of you going
we are going to fling the government to the earth
and he had set out to follow them from that moment forth he had not
uttered a word his step had suddenly become firm artisans had offered
