curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would
like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she
wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most
friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the
town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very
glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached
her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much
engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was
not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall
elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister
though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i
still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to
happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i
receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not
calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was
in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity
though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out
as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know
this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily
account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now
because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said
herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i
cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought
and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very
soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield
again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better
not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and
maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours etc
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on
every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible
advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over
he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune
permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in this case than
in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the
circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that
i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure
and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and
wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial
towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find
out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my
watchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love
with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the
ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there
was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have
been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly
and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement
of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her
and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he
told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on
his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the
first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner
of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of
what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their
opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there
was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that
whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a
good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but
she had known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardiners
door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth
looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls
whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and
kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and
shopping and the evening at one of the theatres
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first object was her
sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to
her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however
to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs
between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end
and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me
because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death
no why should he if it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally
but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it
her not objecting does not justify him it only shows her being
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer
we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my dear
dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you
give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what
are young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport
we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other
travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we
will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen
lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation let our
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in
search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the
road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge
everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte
appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing
at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw
instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage
his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they
were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its
aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but
though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion
when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her
eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but
in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to
the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had
happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way
through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the
fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which
the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the
prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased
probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands
help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be
forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by
charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will
be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed
to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i
should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added
very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news
and telling again what had already been written and when it closed
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened
the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with
oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for
there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more
and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in
quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not
lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them
the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little
creature who would have thought that she could be so thin and small
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she
looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was
stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and
the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it
would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and
so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion
for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different
doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of
her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas
who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every
moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm
elizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a
rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they
followed the servants through an ante chamber to the room where lady
catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship
with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge
of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked
features which might once have been handsome her air was not
conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by
silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone
as marked her self importance and brought mr wickham immediately to
elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the
daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her
being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her
features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very
little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had
likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her
ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted
alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir
william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and
gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing
she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to
be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted she inquired into charlottes domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse
with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew
the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel
pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of
them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they
had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been
her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then
your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your
sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our
instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it
some day do your sisters play and sing
why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss
webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do
that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home
without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to
read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had
known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite
delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs
calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady
catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your
all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the
younger ones out before the elder ones are married your younger sisters
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be
much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind
upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person pray what is your age
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables
were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or
having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the
other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes
of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her
for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many
sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose
the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr
collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soon
as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for
charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her
commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy
mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise
sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but
when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own book room
which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a
more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton
which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened
almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and
had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she
accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one
card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach this
however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was
a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be
important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him
were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently
destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane
in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great
intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of
his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen
them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam
who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and
address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual
reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but
his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual
my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the
subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they
received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by
such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little
of lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the
parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherines drawing room her ladyship received
them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact
almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy
much more than to any other person in the room
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying
at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself
as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not
what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking
of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt
i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health
had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady
catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write
to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she
will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told
her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs
jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that part
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he
drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then
talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away
from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers
countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear
me i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to
colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part
of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to
say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel
fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know
was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced
only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain
knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel
fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to
him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot
catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same
force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault because i will not take the
trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as
capable as any other womans of superior execution
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your
time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know
what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and
could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion
of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have
been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have
been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village
when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a
visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to
be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her
half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions
when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely
necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
