forgotten all that had happened to her she no longer complained of her
position did not say a word about the past and no longer feared to
make happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but when
princess mary mentioned him a long extinguished light once more kindled
in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile
the change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess mary
but when she understood its meaning it grieved her can she have loved
my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thought
when she reflected on the change but when she was with natasha she was
not vexed with her and did not reproach her the reawakened power of
life that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible and
unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had
no right to reproach her even in her heart
natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that
she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but bright
when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with
he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated
and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for
i wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me
understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at her
seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her agitation
these words pained her for a moment she remembered her brother and his
but whats to be done she cant help it thought the princess
and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre
had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha was
to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand
but noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she guessed
the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry
mary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being bad
whatever you tell me i will do tell me
then why are you crying i am happy for your sake said princess mary
who because of those tears quite forgave natashas joy
it wont be just yet someday think what fun it will be when i am his
natasha i have asked you not to speak of that let us talk about you
but why go to petersburg natasha suddenly asked and hastily replied
to her own question but no no he must yes mary he must
seven years had passed the storm tossed sea of european history had
subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the
mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of
their motion are unknown to us continued to operate
though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement
of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groups
of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of
kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation
the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as
previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not
borne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemed
to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies who
formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars
campaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by political
the historians call this activity of the historical figures the
in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the
reaction all the well known people of that period from alexander and
napoleon to madame de stael photius schelling fichte chateaubriand
and the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction
according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia
also and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who according
to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
of his reign being the savior of russia
there is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist to
learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander for
things he did wrong at this period of his reign
he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he did
well and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of
his reign and during 1812 but acted badly by giving a constitution to
poland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheev
favoring golitsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius he
also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for
do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the
liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle with
napoleon the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813
flow from the same sources the circumstances of his birth education
and life that made his personality what it was and from which the
actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of
poland and the reaction of 1820 and later also flowed
in what does the substance of those reproaches lie
it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i
standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to those
strongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and self deception
inseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felt
a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a
fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal
habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truth that
this character though not lacking in virtue the historians do not
accuse him of that had not the same conception of the welfare of
humanity fifty years ago as a present day professor who from his youth
upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and
but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in
his view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume that
the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some
time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity
this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching
the movement of history we see that every year and with each new
writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what
once seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what is
more we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a
constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in
the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or
harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful
if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not
agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether the
preservation of my fathers house in moscow or the glory of the russian
arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or the
freedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power in
europe or a certain kind of european culture called progress appear
to me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things the
action of every historic character has other more general purposes
but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
which to try historic characters and events let us say that alexander
could have done everything differently let us say that with guidance
from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the
program his present accusers would have given him of nationality
freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground let
us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated
and that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of the
activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in
the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was
good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would
have been no life there would have been nothing
if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of
if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france the
balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the
revolution general progress or anything else then it is impossible to
explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
century had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have been
accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion if
the aim was the aggrandizement of france that might have been attained
without the revolution and without the empire if the aim was the
dissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished that
much better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilization
it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives
why did it happen in this and not in some other way
because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized
the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and
therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage of
understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i
think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about
chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary
human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of
to a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction
of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram
who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a
special enclosure where there are oats that this very ram swelling
but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need only
admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken
and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to
the ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose
they are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to the
ram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptions
only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
intelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
ken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic
characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the words
we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european
convulsions and that we know only the facts that is the murders first
in france then in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spain
and in russia and that the movements from the west to the east and from
the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events and
not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to be
anything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to have
recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
these people what they were but it will be clear that all those small
by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shall
clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
any single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it is
impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and
the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the
beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west
the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east
for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to
moscow it was necessary 1 that they should form themselves into a
military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike
military group of the east 2 that they should abandon all established
traditions and customs and 3 that during their military movement they
should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them
the deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committed
and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large
group was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and step
by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and
traditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the
coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done
a man without convictions without habits without traditions without a
name and not even a frenchman emerges by what seem the strangest
chances from among all the seething french parties and without joining
any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position
the ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of his
opponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and self
confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army the
brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy his
opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and self
confidence secure him military fame innumerable so called chances
accompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he falls with the
rulers of france turns to his advantage his attempts to avoid his
predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the russian
service and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing during
the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and
each time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to various diplomatic
considerations the russian armies just those which might have destroyed
his prestige do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there
on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process
of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out
and destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous position
presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to
africa again so called chance accompanies him impregnable malta
surrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned with
success the enemys fleet which subsequently did not let a single boat
pass allows his entire army to elude it in africa a whole series of
outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and the
men who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselves
that this is admirable this is glory it resembles caesar and alexander
this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in
considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
crime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
significance that ideal destined to guide this man and his associates
had scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds the
plague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
imputed to him as a fault his childishly rash uncalled for and
ignoble departure from africa leaving his comrades in distress is set
down to his credit and again the enemys fleet twice lets him slip
past when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully
he reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which a
year earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit and
his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can
only serve to exalt him and though he himself has no plan he is quite
he had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched at
he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and
egypt his insane self adulation his boldness in crime and frankness in
lying he alone could justify what had to be done
he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from his
will and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all his
mistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to
flee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and
says senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proud
and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are
even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have
said to destroy him and retain their power
chance millions of chances give him power and all men as if by
agreement co operate to confirm that power chance forms the characters
of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character
of paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives a
plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
power chance puts the duc denghien in his hands and unexpectedly
causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in
any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance
contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him he
never carries out that intention but unexpectedly falls upon mack and
the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give
him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only the
french but all europe except england which does not take part in the
events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of
his crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himself
and his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and
as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the
western forces push toward the east several times in 1805 1806 1807
and 1809 gaining strength and growing in 1811 the group of people that
had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central
europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during
the ten year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can
oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory
and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their
insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek
the great mans mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that
this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed the pope the
guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the
aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself
for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who
prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud
he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
represented as a great deed the most suitable fete the germans can
devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he
great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his
brothers in law everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so
the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow that
city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but
suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so
consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from
the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire
and the frosts and instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable
the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now
a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east
attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of
1805 1807 and 1809 precede the great westward movement there is the
same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion
of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation
midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached
paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army
are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his
actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance
occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his
craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand but by some
strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man
who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand
is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason
is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and
the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels the
waves of the great movement abate and on the calm surface eddies are
formed in which float the diplomatists who imagine that they have
but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatists
think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of
natural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns the
position seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be rising
does not come from the quarter they expect it rises again from the same
point as before paris the last backwash of the movement from the west
occurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
the man who had devastated france returns to france alone without any
conspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but by
strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
cursed the day before and will curse again a month later
this man is still needed to justify the final collective act
the last role is played the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
powder and paint he will not be wanted any more
and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in
solitude on his island justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
when the justification is no longer needed and displaying to the whole
world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor
see what you believed in this is he do you now see that it was not he
but dazed by the force of the movement it was long before people
still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
alexander i the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
what was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head of
what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european
affairs but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests a moral
superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co operated with him a
mild and attractive personality and a personal grievance against
napoleon and all this was found in alexander i all this had been
prepared by innumerable so called chances in his life his education
his early liberalism the advisers who surrounded him and by
during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed but
as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he
appeared in his place at the given moment and uniting the nations of
the goal is reached after the final war of 1815 alexander possesses all
alexander i the pacifier of europe the man who from his early years
had striven only for his peoples welfare the originator of the liberal
innovations in his fatherland now that he seemed to possess the utmost
power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
welfare of his peoples at the time when napoleon in exile was drawing
up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
had he retained power alexander i having fulfilled his mission and
feeling the hand of god upon him suddenly recognizes the insignificance
of that supposed power turns away from it and gives it into the hands
of contemptible men whom he despises saying only
not unto us not unto us but unto thy name i too am a man like the
rest of you let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god
as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself and
yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
comprehend so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man
a bee settling on a flower has stung a child and the child is afraid of
bees and declares that bees exist to sting people a poet admires the
bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
fragrance of flowers a beekeeper seeing the bee collect pollen from
flowers and carry it to the hive says that it exists to gather honey
another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says
that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a
queen and that it exists to perpetuate its race a botanist notices
that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil
fertilizes the latter and sees in this the purpose of the bees
existence another observing the migration of plants notices that the
bee helps in this work and may say that in this lies the purpose of the
bee but the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first
the second or any of the processes the human mind can discern the
higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes the
more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond our
all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
other manifestations of life and so it is with the purpose of historic
natashas wedding to bezukhov which took place in 1813 was the last
happy event in the family of the old rostovs count ilya rostov died
that same year and as always happens after the fathers death the
the events of the previous year the burning of moscow and the flight
from it the death of prince andrew natashas despair petyas death
and the old countess grief fell blow after blow on the old counts
head he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these
events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and
inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed now frightened
and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising
the arrangements for natashas marriage occupied him for a while he
ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful but
his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it
evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him
when pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to
complain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to his
bed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite
the doctors encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an
armchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him his
medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last day
sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having
dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was
conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died and
next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs all these
acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so
often laughed at him now said with a common feeling of self reproach
and emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may have
been he was a most worthy man you dont meet such men nowadays and
which of us has not weaknesses of his own
it was just when the counts affairs had become so involved that it was
impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he
nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his
fathers death reached him he at once resigned his commission and
without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
moscow the state of the counts affairs became quite obvious a month
after his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts
the existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted to
friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but
he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fathers memory which he
held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts
the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but
powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the counts
careless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as
always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get
paid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them
as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was
allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity the
old man the cause of their losses if they were losses now
remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the
debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them
not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold by
auction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaid
nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother in
law bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value
received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the
creditors threatened he re entered the government service
he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at
the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on
life and so despite his reluctance to remain in moscow among people who
had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil service
he accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of
which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya to a small
natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no
clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from his
brother in law nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him
his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sonya
but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the
countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she
had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was
for her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep to
send for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself or
wine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or
sonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her
whims and secret ill will and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty
from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to
sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her
patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from her
he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and
because there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that people
are valued for but little that could have made him love her he felt
that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her at
her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting something
aside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not save
anything but to comply with his mothers demands he even incurred some
small debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of
marrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his female
relations was repugnant to him the other way out his mothers death
never entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing and
deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an
uncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to avoid his old
acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of
assistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at home
did nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and down
the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to
cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure
at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reports
current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how the
son has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying
i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself
feeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendly
relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the
family she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering her
relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a
great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
nicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only be
reached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she
had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiff
proud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about her
health led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutes
when the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her again
and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom
to her remarks about his mothers health he made no reply whats that
to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to say
why does she come prowling here what does she want i cant bear these
ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in sonyas presence
evidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriage
oh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sonya hardly able to
conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her
nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any
more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a
she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expressed
a wish to see her often but yet always became ill humored when she
nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess
she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you
must go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and i
think it must be dull for you only seeing us
but i dont in the least want to mamma
you used to want to and now you dont really i dont understand you
my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyone
why you said yourself you dont want even to see her she is a very
admirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly you
have got some notion or other in your head you hide everything from
if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask
you to return a call one would think mere politeness required it
well i have asked you and now i wont interfere any more since you
well then ill go if you wish it
it doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sake
nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a
patience trying to divert his mothers attention to another topic
the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the
after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by
nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in
not wishing to be the first to call
i expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to her
aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old
lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many
but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin
to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she had
firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole
matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when
she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was her
relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not express his feeling
for her she knew that but it concealed something and until she could
discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at
one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
nephews lessons she was informed that rostov had called with a firm
resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sent
for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room
her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to
fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintain
they spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of the
latest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
elapsed after which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say good by
with mademoiselle bouriennes help the princess had maintained the
conversation very well but at the very last moment just when he rose
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mind
was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
happiness in life that in a fit of absent mindedness she sat still her
luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risen
nicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice her
abstraction made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again
looked at the princess she still sat motionless with a look of
suffering on her gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for her and was
vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
expressed he wished to help her and say something pleasant but could
oh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up are you going
already count well then good by oh but the cushion for the
wait a moment ill fetch it said mademoiselle bourienne and she
they both sat silent with an occasional glance at one another
yes princess said nicholas at last with a sad smile it doesnt
seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo but how much water has
flowed since then in what distress we all seemed to be then yet i
would give much to bring back that time but theres no bringing it
princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as
he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
his words which would explain his feeling for her
yes yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past count
as i understand your present life i think you will always recall it
with satisfaction because the self sacrifice that fills it now
i cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly on the
contrary i continually reproach myself but this is not at all an
his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but the
princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved and it
i thought you would allow me to tell you this she said i had come
so near to you and to all your family that i thought you would not
consider my sympathy misplaced but i was mistaken and suddenly her
voice trembled i dont know why she continued recovering herself
there are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the why
thank you princess he added softly sometimes it is hard
so thats why thats why a voice whispered in princess marys soul
no it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only that
handsome exterior that i loved in him i divined his noble resolute
self sacrificing spirit too she said to herself yes he is poor now
and i am rich yes thats the only reason yes were it not for
that and remembering his former tenderness and looking now at his
kind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness
but why count why she almost cried unconsciously moving closer to
him why tell me you must tell me
i dont understand your why count she continued but its hard for
me i confess it for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
friendship and that hurts me there were tears in her eyes and in her
voice i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
for me to bear excuse me good by and suddenly she began to cry
princess for gods sake he exclaimed trying to stop her
she turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one
anothers eyes and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly
in the winter of 1813 nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald
hills with his wife his mother and sonya
within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
selling any of his wifes property and having received a small
inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well
in another three years by 1820 he had so managed his affairs that he
was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating
to buy back otradnoe that being his pet dream
having started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to it
that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas was
a plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the english ones
then coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
management disliked factories the raising of expensive products and
the buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of any
particular part of the work on his estate he always had before his
minds eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it the
chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen
in the air nor manures nor special plows but that most important
agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effective
the peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and began to
understand its different branches it was the serf who especially
attracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool
but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched
the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered good
and bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in
reality learning from them their methods their manner of speech and
their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the
peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language to
grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did he
begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them the
duties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliant
guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the
estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder and
delegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before
analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit and
credit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle the
peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the
peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing
the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike
on the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelled
he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and
corn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and
harvested so early and so well or got so good a return as did
he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the drones
as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity when
a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one
had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he
never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that his
every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions
he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to
make things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined
to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he
should or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite in
often speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he would
say what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that he
yet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his whole
soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one
way and manner of farming which produced good results
countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and regretted
that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and
vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she
could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when
after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the
fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing
or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke
with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well
to do peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn all
night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked
before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he
stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache
and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry
and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away
a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the
barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and
gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well
one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover
still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to
anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought
him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to
be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately
refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and
sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he
was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least
it never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good thats
all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to ones neighbor
what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must
put our affairs in order while i am alive thats all and to do that
order and strictness are essential thats all about it said he
clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for
if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he
can do no good either for himself or for me
and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to
allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtues
