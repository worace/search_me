i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me we do it and we know it with
our eyes come on says the chief of that company pointing to the
village bring him fast to his tomb and they bring him faster i
follow his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy and he is lame because he is lame and
consequently slow they drive him with their guns like this
he imitated the action of a mans being impelled forward by the
as they descend the hill like madmen running a race he falls they
laugh and pick him up again his face is bleeding and covered with dust
but he cannot touch it thereupon they laugh again they bring him into
the village all the village runs to look they take him past the mill
and up to the prison all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night and swallow him like this
he opened his mouth as wide as he could and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again defarge said go on jacques
all the village pursued the mender of roads on tiptoe and in a low
voice withdraws all the village whispers by the fountain all the
village sleeps all the village dreams of that unhappy one within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag and never to come out of it
except to perish in the morning with my tools upon my shoulder eating
my morsel of black bread as i go i make a circuit by the prison on
my way to my work there i see him high up behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage bloody and dusty as last night looking through he has no
hand free to wave to me i dare not call to him he regards me like a
defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another the looks of all
of them were dark repressed and revengeful as they listened to the
countrymans story the manner of all of them while it was secret was
authoritative too they had the air of a rough tribunal jacques one
and two sitting on the old pallet bed each with his chin resting on
his hand and his eyes intent on the road mender jacques three equally
intent on one knee behind them with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose defarge
standing between them and the narrator whom he had stationed in the
light of the window by turns looking from him to them and from them to
he remains up there in his iron cage some days the village looks
at him by stealth for it is afraid but it always looks up from a
distance at the prison on the crag and in the evening when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain all
faces are turned towards the prison formerly they were turned towards
the posting house now they are turned towards the prison they
whisper at the fountain that although condemned to death he will not be
executed they say that petitions have been presented in paris showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child they say
that a petition has been presented to the king himself what do i know
listen then jacques number one of that name sternly interposed
know that a petition was presented to the king and queen all here
yourself excepted saw the king take it in his carriage in the street
sitting beside the queen it is defarge whom you see here who at the
hazard of his life darted out before the horses with the petition in
and once again listen jacques said the kneeling number three
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves with a
strikingly greedy air as if he hungered for something that was neither
food nor drink the guard horse and foot surrounded the petitioner
again on the other hand they whisper at the fountain resumed the
countryman that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot and that he will very certainly be executed they even whisper
that because he has slain monseigneur and because monseigneur was the
father of his tenants serfs what you will he will be executed as a
parricide one old man says at the fountain that his right hand armed
with the knife will be burnt off before his face that into wounds
which will be made in his arms his breast and his legs there will be
poured boiling oil melted lead hot resin wax and sulphur finally
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses that old man
says all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late king louis fifteen but how do i know if he lies
listen once again then jacques said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air the name of that prisoner was damiens and it was
all done in open day in the open streets of this city of paris and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion who were full of eager
attention to the last to the last jacques prolonged until nightfall
when he had lost two legs and an arm and still breathed and it was
thirty five said the mender of roads who looked sixty
it was done when you were more than ten years old you might have seen
enough said defarge with grim impatience long live the devil go
well some whisper this some whisper that they speak of nothing else
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune at length on sunday
night when all the village is asleep come soldiers winding down from
the prison and their guns ring on the stones of the little street
workmen dig workmen hammer soldiers laugh and sing in the morning by
the fountain there is raised a gallows forty feet high poisoning the
the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky
all work is stopped all assemble there nobody leads the cows out
the cows are there with the rest at midday the roll of drums soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night and he is in the midst
of many soldiers he is bound as before and in his mouth there is
a gag tied so with a tight string making him look almost as if he
laughed he suggested it by creasing his face with his two thumbs
from the corners of his mouth to his ears on the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife blade upwards with its point in the air he is hanged
there forty feet high and is left hanging poisoning the water
they looked at one another as he used his blue cap to wipe his face
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
it is frightful messieurs how can the women and the children draw
water who can gossip of an evening under that shadow under it have
i said when i left the village monday evening as the sun was going to
bed and looked back from the hill the shadow struck across the church
across the mill across the prison seemed to strike across the earth
messieurs to where the sky rests upon it
the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him
thats all messieurs i left at sunset as i had been warned to do
and i walked on that night and half next day until i met as i was
warned i should this comrade with him i came on now riding and now
walking through the rest of yesterday and through last night and here
after a gloomy silence the first jacques said good you have acted
and recounted faithfully will you wait for us a little outside the
very willingly said the mender of roads whom defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned
the three had risen and their heads were together when he came back to
how say you jacques demanded number one to be registered
to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge
the chateau and all the race inquired the first
the chateau and all the race returned defarge extermination
the hungry man repeated in a rapturous croak magnificent and began
are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register without doubt it is
safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it but shall we always
be able to decipher it or i ought to say will she
jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would not lose
a word of it not a syllable of it knitted in her own stitches and her
own symbols it will always be as plain to her as the sun confide in
madame defarge it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives
to erase himself from existence than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge
there was a murmur of confidence and approval and then the man who
hungered asked is this rustic to be sent back soon i hope so he is
very simple is he not a little dangerous
he knows nothing said defarge at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height i charge myself
with him let him remain with me i will take care of him and set him
on his road he wishes to see the fine world the king the queen and
what exclaimed the hungry man staring is it a good sign that he
jacques said defarge judiciously show a cat milk if you wish her
to thirst for it judiciously show a dog his natural prey if you wish
nothing more was said and the mender of roads being found already
dozing on the topmost stair was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet bed and take some rest he needed no persuasion and was soon
worse quarters than defarges wine shop could easily have been found
in paris for a provincial slave of that degree saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted his life was very
new and agreeable but madame sat all day at her counter so expressly
unconscious of him and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her for he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out
therefore when sunday came the mender of roads was not enchanted
though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to versailles it was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there in a public conveyance it was
additionally disconcerting yet to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the king and queen
you work hard madame said a man near her
yes answered madame defarge i have a good deal to do
the man moved a little further away as soon as he could and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap feeling it mightily close
and oppressive if he needed a king and queen to restore him he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand for soon the large faced king
and the fair faced queen came in their golden coach attended by the
shining bulls eye of their court a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes the mender of roads bathed himself so much to his temporary
intoxication that he cried long live the king long live the queen
long live everybody and everything as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous jacques in his time then there were gardens courtyards
terraces fountains green banks more king and queen more bulls eye
more lords and ladies more long live they all until he absolutely wept
with sentiment during the whole of this scene which lasted some three
hours he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company
and throughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
bravo said defarge clapping him on the back when it was over like a
the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations but no
you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever then they are the more
hey cried the mender of roads reflectively thats true
these fools know nothing while they despise your breath and would
stop it for ever and ever in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs they only know what your breath
tells them let it deceive them then a little longer it cannot
madame defarge looked superciliously at the client and nodded in
as to you said she you would shout and shed tears for anything if
it made a show and a noise say would you not
truly madame i think so for the moment
if you were shown a great heap of dolls and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage you would
pick out the richest and gayest say would you not
yes and if you were shown a flock of birds unable to fly and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers would you not
you have seen both dolls and birds to day said madame defarge with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent
madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to
the whispering trees such ample leisure had the stone faces now
for listening to the trees and to the fountain that the few village
scarecrows who in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered a rumour just lived in the
village had a faint and bare existence there as its people had that
when the knife struck home the faces changed from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain also that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain they changed again and bore a cruel
look of being avenged which they would henceforth bear for ever in the
stone face over the great window of the bed chamber where the murder
was done two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose which
everybody recognised and which nobody had seen of old and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute before they all
started away among the moss and leaves like the more fortunate hares
chateau and hut stone face and dangling figure the red stain on the
stone floor and the pure water in the village well thousands of acres
of land a whole province of france all france itself lay under the
night sky concentrated into a faint hair breadth line so does a whole
world with all its greatnesses and littlenesses lie in a twinkling
star and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition so sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours every thought and act every
vice and virtue of every responsible creature on it
the defarges husband and wife came lumbering under the starlight
in their public vehicle to that gate of paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended there was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry monsieur defarge alighted knowing one or two
of the soldiery there and one of the police the latter he was intimate
when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings
and they having finally alighted near the saints boundaries were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
say then my friend what did jacques of the police tell thee
very little to night but all he knows there is another spy
commissioned for our quarter there may be many more for all that he
eh well said madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air it is necessary to register him how do they call that
barsad said defarge making it french by pronunciation but he had
been so careful to get it accurately that he then spelt it with perfect
john barsad repeated madame after murmuring it once to herself
age about forty years height about five feet nine black hair
complexion dark generally rather handsome visage eyes dark face
thin long and sallow nose aquiline but not straight having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek expression therefore
eh my faith it is a portrait said madame laughing he shall be
they turned into the wine shop which was closed for it was midnight
and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence examined the
stock went through the entries in the book made other entries of
her own checked the serving man in every possible way and finally
dismissed him to bed then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief in a chain of separate knots for safe keeping through the
night all this while defarge with his pipe in his mouth walked
up and down complacently admiring but never interfering in which
condition indeed as to the business and his domestic affairs he
the night was hot and the shop close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood was ill smelling monsieur defarges olfactory sense was
by no means delicate but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed he
whiffed the compound of scents away as he put down his smoked out pipe
you are fatigued said madame raising her glance as she knotted the
i am a little tired her husband acknowledged
you are a little depressed too said madame whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts but they had had a ray or two for
but my dear repeated madame nodding firmly but my dear you are
well then said defarge as if a thought were wrung out of his
it is a long time repeated his wife and when is it not a long time
vengeance and retribution require a long time it is the rule
it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning said
how long demanded madame composedly does it take to make and store
defarge raised his head thoughtfully as if there were something in that
it does not take a long time said madame for an earthquake to
swallow a town eh well tell me how long it takes to prepare the
but when it is ready it takes place and grinds to pieces everything
before it in the meantime it is always preparing though it is not
seen or heard that is your consolation keep it
she tied a knot with flashing eyes as if it throttled a foe
i tell thee said madame extending her right hand for emphasis
that although it is a long time on the road it is on the road and
coming i tell thee it never retreats and never stops i tell thee it
is always advancing look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know consider the faces of all the world that we know consider
the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour can such things last bah i mock
my brave wife returned defarge standing before her with his head
a little bent and his hands clasped at his back like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist i do not question all this but
it has lasted a long time and it is possible you know well my wife
it is possible that it may not come during our lives
eh well how then demanded madame tying another knot as if there
well said defarge with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug
we shall have helped it returned madame with her extended hand in
strong action nothing that we do is done in vain i believe with all
my soul that we shall see the triumph but even if not even if i knew
certainly not show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant and still i
then madame with her teeth set tied a very terrible knot indeed
hold cried defarge reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice i too my dear will stop at nothing
yes but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity to sustain you sustain yourself without that
when the time comes let loose a tiger and a devil but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained not shown yet always ready
madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner and observing that it was time to go to bed
next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine shop knitting away assiduously a rose lay beside her and if she
now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air there were a few customers drinking or not
drinking standing or seated sprinkled about the day was very hot
and heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame fell
dead at the bottom their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading who looked at them in the coolest manner as if they
themselves were elephants or something as far removed until they met
the same fate curious to consider how heedless flies are perhaps they
thought as much at court that sunny summer day
a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she
felt to be a new one she laid down her knitting and began to pin her
rose in her head dress before she looked at the figure
it was curious the moment madame defarge took up the rose the
customers ceased talking and began gradually to drop out of the
she said it aloud but added to herself as she resumed her knitting
hah good day age about forty height about five feet nine black
hair generally rather handsome visage complexion dark eyes dark
thin long and sallow face aquiline nose but not straight having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac and a
it was the first time it had ever been so complimented and madame
defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better she said
however that the cognac was flattered and took up her knitting the
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and took the opportunity
you think so said madame looking at him with a smile
decidedly may one ask what it is for
pastime said madame still looking at him with a smile while her
that depends i may find a use for it one day if i do well said
madame drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
it was remarkable but the taste of saint antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head dress of madame defarge two
men had entered separately and had been about to order drink when
catching sight of that novelty they faltered made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there and went away
nor of those who had been there when this visitor entered was there
one left they had all dropped off the spy had kept his eyes open
but had been able to detect no sign they had lounged away in a
poverty stricken purposeless accidental manner quite natural and
john thought madame checking off her work as her fingers knitted
and her eyes looked at the stranger stay long enough and i shall knit
business is very bad the people are so poor
ah the unfortunate miserable people so oppressed too as you say
as you say madame retorted correcting him and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good
pardon me certainly it was i who said so but you naturally think so
i think returned madame in a high voice i and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine shop open without thinking all we
think here is how to live that is the subject we think of and
it gives us from morning to night enough to think about without
embarrassing our heads concerning others i think for others no no
the spy who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face but
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbow on madame
defarges little counter and occasionally sipping his cognac
a bad business this madame of gaspards execution ah the poor
my faith returned madame coolly and lightly if people use knives
for such purposes they have to pay for it he knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was he has paid the price
i believe said the spy dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face i believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood touching the poor
as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door the spy saluted
him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smile good day
jacques defarge stopped short and stared at him
good day jacques the spy repeated with not quite so much
confidence or quite so easy a smile under the stare
you deceive yourself monsieur returned the keeper of the wine shop
you mistake me for another that is not my name i am ernest defarge
it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited too good
i was saying to madame with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered that they tell me there is and no wonder much sympathy
and anger in saint antoine touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard
no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head i know nothing
having said it he passed behind the little counter and stood with his
hand on the back of his wifes chair looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed and whom either of them would
the spy well used to his business did not change his unconscious
attitude but drained his little glass of cognac took a sip of fresh
water and asked for another glass of cognac madame defarge poured it
out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a little song over
you seem to know this quarter well that is to say better than i do
not at all but i hope to know it better i am so profoundly interested
the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls to me
pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
yes indeed when doctor manette was released you his old domestic
had the charge of him i know he was delivered to you you see i am
such is the fact certainly said defarge he had had it conveyed
to him in an accidental touch of his wifes elbow as she knitted and
warbled that he would do best to answer but always with brevity
it was to you said the spy that his daughter came and it was
from your care that his daughter took him accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur how is he called in a little wig lorry of the bank of
very interesting remembrances said the spy i have known doctor
you dont hear much about them now said the spy
in effect madame struck in looking up from her work and her little
song we never hear about them we received the news of their safe
arrival and perhaps another letter or perhaps two but since then
they have gradually taken their road in life we ours and we have held
perfectly so madame replied the spy she is going to be married
going echoed madame she was pretty enough to have been married long
ago you english are cold it seems to me
i perceive your tongue is returned madame and what the tongue is i
he did not take the identification as a compliment but he made the best
of it and turned it off with a laugh after sipping his cognac to the
yes miss manette is going to be married but not to an englishman to
one who like herself is french by birth and speaking of gaspard ah
poor gaspard it was cruel cruel it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis for whom gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet in other words the present
marquis but he lives unknown in england he is no marquis there he is
mr charles darnay daulnais is the name of his mothers family
madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband do what he would behind the little counter
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe he was
troubled and his hand was not trustworthy the spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it or to record it in his mind
having made at least this one hit whatever it might prove to be
worth and no customers coming in to help him to any other mr barsad
paid for what he had drunk and took his leave taking occasion to say
in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again for some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them lest he should
can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair what he has
as he has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a little it
is probably false but it may be true
 and if it does come while we live to see it triumph i hope for her
sake destiny will keep her husband out of france
her husbands destiny said madame defarge with her usual composure
will take him where he is to go and will lead him to the end that is
to end him that is all i know
but it is very strange now at least is it not very strange said
defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it
that after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herself her
husbands name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment by
the side of that infernal dogs who has just left us
stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered
madame i have them both here of a certainty and they are both here
she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head
either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone or saint antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance howbeit the saint took courage to lounge in very
shortly afterwards and the wine shop recovered its habitual aspect
in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turned
himself inside out and sat on door steps and window ledges and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts for a breath of air madame
defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group a missionary there were many like
her such as the world will do well never to breed again all the women
knitted they knitted worthless things but the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus if the bony fingers had been still
the stomachs would have been more famine pinched
but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts and as madame
defarge moved on from group to group all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with and left
her husband smoked at his door looking after her with admiration a
great woman said he a strong woman a grand woman a frightfully
darkness closed around and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard as
the women sat knitting knitting darkness encompassed them another
darkness was closing in as surely when the church bells then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france should be melted into
thundering cannon when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty
freedom and life so much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting knitting that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt where they were to sit knitting knitting
never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
soho than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat
under the plane tree together never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great london than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree and shone upon their faces through its leaves
lucie was to be married to morrow she had reserved this last evening
for her father and they sat alone under the plane tree
they had said little though they had been there a long time when it
was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work nor had she read to him she had employed herself in
both ways at his side under the tree many and many a time but this
time was not quite like any other and nothing could make it so
and i am very happy to night dear father i am deeply happy in the
love that heaven has so blessed my love for charles and charless love
for me but if my life were not to be still consecrated to you or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us even by
the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappy and
self reproachful now than i can tell you even as it is 
even as it was she could not command her voice
in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face
upon his breast in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of
the sun itself is as the light called human life is at its coming and
dearest dear can you tell me this last time that you feel quite
quite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine will
ever interpose between us i know it well but do you know it in your
her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed quite sure my darling more than that he
added as he tenderly kissed her my future is far brighter lucie
seen through your marriage than it could have been nay than it ever
believe it love indeed it is so consider how natural and how plain
it is my dear that it should be so you devoted and young cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be
she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his and repeated
 wasted my child should not be wasted struck aside from the
natural order of things for my sake your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this but only ask yourself
how could my happiness be perfect while yours was incomplete
if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quite happy
he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
my child you did see him and it is charles if it had not been
charles it would have been another or if it had been no other i
should have been the cause and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you
it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering it gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears and she remembered it long
see said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards the moon
i have looked at her from my prison window when i could not bear her
light i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beaten my head against
my prison walls i have looked at her in a state so dull and lethargic
that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i
could draw across her at the full and the number of perpendicular lines
with which i could intersect them he added in his inward and pondering
manner as he looked at the moon it was twenty either way i remember
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in
the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time
deepened as he dwelt upon it but there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference he only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over
i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom i had been rent whether it was alive whether it had
been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father there was a time in my
imprisonment when my desire for vengeance was unbearable whether it
was a son who would never know his fathers story who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own
will and act whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman
she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand
i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful of
me rather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me i have
cast up the years of her age year after year i have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate i have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living and in the next generation my place was a
my father even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child
you lucie it is out of the consolation and restoration you have
brought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and
the moon on this last night what did i say just now
she knew nothing of you she cared nothing for you
so but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could i have imagined her as coming to me in my cell and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress i have seen her
image in the moonlight often as i now see you except that i never held
her in my arms it stood between the little grated window and the door
but you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of
the figure was not the the image the fancy
no that was another thing it stood before my disturbed sense of
sight but it never moved the phantom that my mind pursued was another
and more real child of her outward appearance i know no more than
that she was like her mother the other had that likeness too as you
have but was not the same can you follow me lucie hardly i think
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition
in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlight
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father my picture
was in her room and i was in her prayers her life was active
cheerful useful but my poor history pervaded it all
i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my love
and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvais and
they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me when they passed
a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning walls and looked
up at its bars and spoke in whispers she could never deliver me i
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things
but then blessed with the relief of tears i fell upon my knees and
i am that child i hope my father o my dear my dear will you bless
lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have to night
for loving you better than words can tell and thanking god for my great
happiness my thoughts when they were wildest never rose near the
happiness that i have known with you and that we have before us
he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him by and bye they went into the
there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr lorry there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence they had been able to extend it
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothing more
doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper they were only
three at table and miss pross made the third he regretted that charles
was not there was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away and drank to him affectionately
so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and they separated
but in the stillness of the third hour of the morning lucie came
downstairs again and stole into his room not free from unshaped fears
all things however were in their places all was quiet and he lay
asleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet she put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips to his

into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had worn but he
