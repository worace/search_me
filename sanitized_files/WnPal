among them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent to
tushins battery but had never reached it interrupting one another
they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed
reprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders and silently
fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without
knowing why rode behind on his artillery nag though the orders were to
abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after troops and
begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer who
just before the battle had rushed out of tushins wattle shed was laid
with a bullet in his stomach on matvevnas carriage at the foot of
the hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with the other came
up to tushin and asked for a seat
captain for gods sake ive hurt my arm he said timidly for gods
it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
been refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice
tell them to give me a seat for gods sake
give him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit on lad he
said addressing his favorite soldier and where is the wounded
he has been set down he died replied someone
help him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak
the cadet was rostov with one hand he supported the other he was pale
and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on matvevna
the gun from which they had removed the dead officer the cloak they
spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm
what are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gun on
then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushin
it was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman
wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the
it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the
right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in
the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers
who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the
village again but tushins guns could not move and the artillerymen
tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their
fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out
weve given it em hot mate they wont make another push now said
you couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothing
could be seen pitch dark brother isnt there something to drink
the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in
the complete darkness tushins guns moved forward surrounded by the
in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the
wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night
after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a
white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing what
did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eager
questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closer
together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently
those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of
fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushin
having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing
station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the
soldiers had kindled on the road rostov too dragged himself to the
fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole
body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by an
excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory
position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire
which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble round shouldered
figure of tushin who was sitting cross legged like a turk beside him
tushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
commiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with his whole heart wished
from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who
were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of
voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the
crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble
it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the
gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm
rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held
his hands to the blaze and turned away his face
you dont mind your honor he asked tushin ive lost my company
your honor i dont know where such bad luck
with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
the bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved a
trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to
the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to
you picked it up i dare say youre very smart one of them
then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water
must one die like a dog said he
tushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran
up begging a little fire for the infantry
a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow
countrymen thanks for the fire well return it with interest said
he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick
next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed
who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he
and they disappeared into the darkness with their load
still aching tushin asked rostov in a whisper
your honor youre wanted by the general he is in the hut here said
tushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked
not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for
him prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commanding
officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with the
half closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the
general who had served blamelessly for twenty two years flushed by a
glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet
ring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew
pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes
in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and
the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking his
head in perplexity perhaps because the banner really interested him
perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a
dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was a
french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers
were flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking the
individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
losses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was
informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the
french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was
disorganized i stopped in the road and thought ill let them come on
and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion and thats
the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it
might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that
by the way your excellency i should inform you he continued
remembering dolokhovs conversation with kutuzov and his last interview
with the gentleman ranker that private dolokhov who was reduced to
the ranks took a french officer prisoner in my presence and
i saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in
zherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all that
day but had heard about them from an infantry officer they broke up
several of those present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one of his
usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory
of our arms and of the days work they assumed a serious expression
though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any
foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel
gentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry
cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the
center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone prince
bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that all
the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action
i think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty
one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i cant
understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only just
left it is true that it was hot there he added modestly
someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the
oh but you were there said prince bagration addressing prince
of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer
i had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly and
all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the
generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and
stumbled over it several of those present laughed
how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so much
at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkov laughed
only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt
and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he
had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter
confused him still more he stood before bagration with his lower jaw
trembling and was hardly able to mutter i dont know your
you might have taken some from the covering troops
tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was
perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into
trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has
the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishing
to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to
intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and his
your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
voice you were pleased to send me to captain tushins battery i went
there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns
prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkonski
and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he
continued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that battery
and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company and without
awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table
prince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust
in bolkonskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it
bent his head and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went out
thank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushin
prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt
sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped
who are they why are they here what do they want and when will all
this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows before him
the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible
drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the
impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
with the physical pain it was they these soldiers wounded and
unwounded it was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting
the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to
rid himself of them he closed his eyes
for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things
appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand sonyas
thin little shoulders natashas eyes and laughter denisov with his
voice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and
bogdanich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh
voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly
incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one
direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an
instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth it would not ache it
would be well if only they did not pull it but it was impossible to
he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were
fluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had not
come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body
nobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me or pity
me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed and
eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt out
over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added
what a lot of men have been crippled today frightful
rostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes
fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm
bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his
healthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why did
next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of
prince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans
still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he was
merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life were
constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the
circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one
or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves
some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he
did not for instance say to himself this man now has influence i
must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must entice
him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need
but when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told
him that this man could be useful and without any premeditation prince
vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter him
become intimate with him and finally make his request
he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as
gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of
councilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
petersburg and staying at his house with apparent absent mindedness
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing
prince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had he
thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and
shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward
those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people
pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felt
himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to
sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of
which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his
estate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even
wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and
grieved had he chosen not to see them these different people
businessmen relations and acquaintances alike were all disposed to
treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they
were all evidently firmly convinced of pierres noble qualities he was
always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness or with
your excellent heart you are yourself so honorable count or were
he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe in
his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so
as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really
was very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly been
spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and
affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair
plastered down like a dolls had come into pierres room after the
funeral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was
very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she
had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after
the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house
she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain
from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could
so change pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness without
knowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward
pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him
do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a
great deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing him a
prince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
this bone a bill for thirty thousand rubles to the poor princess that
it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the
inlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
grew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to him
especially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made
him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him
it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it
would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could
not but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had no
time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he was
always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and
general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if
he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he
did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of
him but still that happy result always remained in the future
more than anyone else prince vasili took possession of pierres affairs
and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count
bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of a man
oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for
pitys sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of
his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice
of fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent in
moscow after the death of count bezukhov he would call pierre or go to
him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness
and assurance as if he were adding every time you know i am
overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble
myself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose is
well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince vasili
one day closing his eyes and fingering pierres elbow speaking as if
he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could
not now be altered we start tomorrow and im giving you a place in my
carriage i am very glad all our important business here is now
settled and i ought to have been off long ago here is something i have
received from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have been
entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber
the diplomatic career now lies open before you
notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career
wished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him in the
special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting his
speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
mais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience
and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet of
being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up
tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to
petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible
recollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my boy and my valet
can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added you
know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so i have
received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you wont
require it well go into the accounts later
by what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant several
thousand rubles quitrent received from pierres peasants which the
in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather the
rank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for him and
acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous
that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle
and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never
of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg
the guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to the
ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew
was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with a
friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was
taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasilis
house in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful
like the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change of
attitude toward him that had taken place in society
formerly in anna pavlovnas presence pierre had always felt that what
he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks
which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish
as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolytes stupidest
remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said was
charmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see that she
wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty
in the beginning of the winter of 1805 6 pierre received one of anna
pavlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you
will find the beautiful helene here whom it is always delightful to
when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some
link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
helene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were
being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an
anna pavlovnas at home was like the former one only the novelty she
offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh
from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexanders
visit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged
themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice
against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with
a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young mans recent loss
by the death of count bezukhov everyone constantly considered it a duty
to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the
father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the august
melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the
empress marya fedorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovna
arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual
skill the large group in which were prince vasili and the generals
had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea table
pierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovna who was in the
excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of
new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in
action seeing pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying
wait a bit i have something in view for you this evening she
glanced at helene and smiled at her my dear helene be charitable to
my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for ten minutes
and that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will not
the beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions
isnt she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately
beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young a
girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from her
heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of men
would occupy a most brilliant position in society dont you think so i
only wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre go
pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to helenes perfection of
manner if he ever thought of helene it was just of her beauty and her
remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society
the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed
desirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined rather to show
her fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring what
she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pavlovna again
touched pierres sleeve saying i hope you wont say that it is dull
in my house again and she glanced at helene
helene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt
coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see
helene then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the
same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation helene
turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to
everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning
for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of
a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierres father count
bezukhov and showed them her own box princess helene asked to see the
portrait of the aunts husband on the box lid
that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a
celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the
snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table
he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox
passing it across helenes back helene stooped forward to make room
and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties
wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and
back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was so
close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the
living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need
only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was conscious
of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her
corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete
whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her
garments and having once seen this he could not help being aware of it
just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through
so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am helene seemed to
say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may
belong to anyone to you too said her glance and at that moment
pierre felt that helene not only could but must be his wife and that
he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not
even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why
that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen
pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see
her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every
day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more
than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him
she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any
barrier except the barrier of his own will
well i will leave you in your little corner came anna pavlovnas
voice i see you are all right there
and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone
knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself
a little later when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna said
to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house
this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and
pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house
thats a good thing but dont move from prince vasilis it is good to
have a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince vasili i
know something about that dont i and you are still so young you need
advice dont be angry with me for exercising an old womans privilege
she paused as women always do expecting something after they have
mentioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing she
continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at
helene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he
when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that
the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned
he had said absent mindedly yes shes good looking he had
understood that this woman might belong to him
but shes stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought there
is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me i
have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she
with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sent
away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her father its
bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection
was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that
another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her
worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she
would love him become quite different and how all he had thought and
heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of
prince vasili but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray
dress but no why did this thought never occur to me before and
again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be
something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this
marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks
of those who had seen them together he recalled anna pavlovnas words
and looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands of
such hints from prince vasili and others and was seized by terror lest
he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was
evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was
expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her
in november 1805 prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in
four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole
where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas
bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs
prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had
latterly spent whole days at home that is in prince vasilis house
where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in
helenes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to
this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasili
to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who
was under such obligations to him but never mind that was not
behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well god be
with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it must
be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be lelyas name day i
will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what he
ought to do then it will be my affair yes my affair i am her father
six weeks after anna pavlovnas at home and after the sleepless night
when he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and that he
ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had not
left prince vasilis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was
every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for
him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break
away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would
have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able to
free himself but that prince vasili who had rarely before given
receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party
at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general
pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation prince vasili in the
rare moments when he was at home would take pierres hand in passing
and draw it downwards or absent mindedly hold out his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be
in to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for your
sake and so on and though prince vasili when he stayed in as he
said for pierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him
pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one
and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind
what she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she
is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself
she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little
but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid
she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad
woman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her
company and she had always answered him either by a brief but
appropriate remark showing that it did not interest her or by a silent
look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her
superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in
she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
alone in which there was something more significant than in the general
smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror
seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during
that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need
resolution can it be that i have none
he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter
he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by
a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pavlovnas
an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will
on helenes name day a small party of just their own people as his
wife said met for supper at prince vasilis all these friends and
relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl
would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper
princess kuragina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome
was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the more
important guests an old general and his wife and anna pavlovna
scherer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests and
there too sat the members of the family and pierre and helene side by
side prince vasili was not having any supper he went round the table
in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests
to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to
pierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened
the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal
gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mens
epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table the
clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum of
several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was
heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which
she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of
some mary viktorovna or other at the center of the table prince vasili
attracted everybodys attention with a facetious smile on his face he
was telling the ladies about last wednesdays meeting of the imperial
council at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governor
general of petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript of
the emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich in which the
emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the
peoples loyalty that the declaration from petersburg gave him
particular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such a
nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it this rescript began with
the words sergey kuzmich from all sides reports reach me etc
well and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked one of
exactly not a hairs breadth farther answered prince vasili
laughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sides sergey
kuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther he began the
rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered sergey he sobbed
kuz mi ch tears and from all sides was smothered in sobs and he
could get no farther and again his handkerchief and again sergey
kuzmich from all sides and tears till at last somebody else was
kuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeated
dont be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table holding
up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent man our
everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where the
honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
influence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and helene
sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a
suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing
to do with sergey kuzmich a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings
but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they
enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoided
looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed
of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the
story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a
pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed to
pierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmich
and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and while he
laughed the expression on his face clearly said yes its getting
on it will all be settled today anna pavlovna threatened him on
behalf of our dear vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for an
instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read a congratulation on his
future son in law and on his daughters happiness the old princess
sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and
glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say yes
theres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now
that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly
provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am saying
thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers
into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feeling
dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter
jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was
evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked
at the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red broad and
happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light of
the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone
pierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased and
embarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation
he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and then
detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened how
quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself alone
but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are all
expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i
cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will
certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders
or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it
awkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky man
and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed
of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so he consoled
himself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did it
begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then there was
nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards with
her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it begin
when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side as her
betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her
movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him that it was
not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why they
all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he would
expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortune
suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second
time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was
i am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeated prince
vasili a third time how absent minded you are my dear fellow
prince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
him and helene well what of it if you all know it thought pierre
what of it its the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike
when did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince
vasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute
how can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre
yes from olmutz he answered with a sigh
after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the
drawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave of
helene some as if unwilling to distract her from an important
occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away
refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful
silence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with pierres happiness the old general
grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the old fool
he thought that princess helene will be beautiful still when shes
i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old
princess kissing her soundly if i hadnt this headache id have
the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her
while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time
alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting he
had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her
but had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable
but he could not make up his mind to take the final step he felt
ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here beside
helene this happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered to
him this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in
but as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was
satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner that
this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had
some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in the
large drawing room prince vasili came up to pierre with languid
footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasili gave
him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so
strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of
severity changed and he drew pierres hand downwards made him sit
well lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and
addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince
vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents
sergey kuzmich from all sides  he said unbuttoning the top button of
pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then and prince
vasili saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something and
went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted
the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched
pierre he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcerted and her
look seemed to say well it is your own fault
the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he
again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmich
asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly
helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it
when prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess his wife
was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre
of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear
marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady
prince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on
a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to be
dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself
aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about
the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and
indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and
still the same she said to her husband
prince vasili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking
himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past
the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went
joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre
thank god said prince vasili my wife has told me everything he
put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter my dear
boy lelya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved your
father and she will make you a good wife god bless you
he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his
the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using her
handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful
helenes hand several times after a while they were left alone again
all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it
is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because its
definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held the
hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it
something special is always said in such cases he thought but could
not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face she
oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles
pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have
from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and
inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but
with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his
lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered
it is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierre
je vous aime  he said remembering what has to be said at such
moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself
six weeks later he was married and settled in count bezukhovs large
newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people said
