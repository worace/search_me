between us and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble
steps to move towards the house but as fate would have it and it might
have been very unfortunate if heaven had not otherwise ordered it just
as we were moving on in the manner and position i have described with
her arm round my neck her father as he returned after having sent away
the turks saw how we were walking and we perceived that he saw us but
zoraida ready and quickwitted took care not to remove her arm from my
neck but on the contrary drew closer to me and laid her head on my
breast bending her knees a little and showing all the signs and tokens
of fainting while i at the same time made it seem as though i were
supporting her against my will her father came running up to where we
were and seeing his daughter in this state asked what was the matter
with her she however giving no answer he said no doubt she has
fainted in alarm at the entrance of those dogs and taking her from mine
he drew her to his own breast while she sighing her eyes still wet with
tears said again ameji cristiano ameji go christian go to
this her father replied there is no need daughter for the christian
to go for he has done thee no harm and the turks have now gone feel no
alarm there is nothing to hurt thee for as i say the turks at my
request have gone back the way they came
it was they who terrified her as thou hast said senor said i to her
father but since she tells me to go i have no wish to displease her
peace be with thee and with thy leave i will come back to this garden
for herbs if need be for my master says there are nowhere better herbs
come back for any thou hast need of replied hadji morato for my
daughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any
christian she only meant that the turks should go not thou or that it
was time for thee to look for thy herbs
with this i at once took my leave of both and she looking as though her
heart were breaking retired with her father while pretending to look
for herbs i made the round of the garden at my ease and studied
carefully all the approaches and outlets and the fastenings of the house
and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task easy
having done so i went and gave an account of all that had taken place to
the renegade and my comrades and looked forward with impatience to the
hour when all fear at an end i should find myself in possession of the
prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely zoraida the
time passed at length and the appointed day we so longed for arrived
and all following out the arrangement and plan which after careful
consideration and many a long discussion we had decided upon we
succeeded as fully as we could have wished for on the friday following
the day upon which i spoke to zoraida in the garden the renegade
anchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot where she was
the christians who were to row were ready and in hiding in different
places round about all waiting for me anxious and elated and eager to
attack the vessel they had before their eyes for they did not know the
renegades plan but expected that they were to gain their liberty by
force of arms and by killing the moors who were on board the vessel as
soon then as i and my comrades made our appearance all those that were
in hiding seeing us came and joined us it was now the time when the city
gates are shut and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside
when we were collected together we debated whether it would be better
first to go for zoraida or to make prisoners of the moorish rowers who
rowed in the vessel but while we were still uncertain our renegade came
up asking us what kept us as it was now the time and all the moors were
off their guard and most of them asleep we told him why we hesitated
but he said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel which
could be done with the greatest ease and without any danger and then we
could go for zoraida we all approved of what he said and so without
further delay guided by him we made for the vessel and he leaping on
board first drew his cutlass and said in morisco let no one stir from
this if he does not want it to cost him his life by this almost all the
christians were on board and the moors who were fainthearted hearing
their captain speak in this way were cowed and without any one of them
taking to his arms and indeed they had few or hardly any they submitted
without saying a word to be bound by the christians who quickly secured
them threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would
be all put to the sword this having been accomplished and half of our
party being left to keep guard over them the rest of us again taking
the renegade as our guide hastened towards hadji moratos garden and as
good luck would have it on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it
had not been locked and so quite quietly and in silence we reached the
house without being perceived by anybody the lovely zoraida was watching
for us at a window and as soon as she perceived that there were people
there she asked in a low voice if we were nizarani as much as to say
or ask if we were christians i answered that we were and begged her to
come down as soon as she recognised me she did not delay an instant but
without answering a word came down immediately opened the door and
presented herself before us all so beautiful and so richly attired that
i cannot attempt to describe her the moment i saw her i took her hand
and kissed it and the renegade and my two comrades did the same and the
rest who knew nothing of the circumstances did as they saw us do for
it only seemed as if we were returning thanks to her and recognising her
as the giver of our liberty the renegade asked her in the morisco
language if her father was in the house she replied that he was and that
then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us said the
renegade and everything of value in this fair mansion
nay said she my father must not on any account be touched and there
is nothing in the house except what i shall take and that will be quite
enough to enrich and satisfy all of you wait a little and you shall
see and so saying she went in telling us she would return immediately
and bidding us keep quiet making any noise
i asked the renegade what had passed between them and when he told me i
declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes
of zoraida who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns
that she could scarcely carry it unfortunately her father awoke while
this was going on and hearing a noise in the garden came to the window
and at once perceiving that all those who were there were christians
raising a prodigiously loud outcry he began to call out in arabic
christians christians thieves thieves by which cries we were all
thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment but the renegade seeing
the danger we were in and how important it was for him to effect his
purpose before we were heard mounted with the utmost quickness to where
hadji morato was and with him went some of our party i however did
not dare to leave zoraida who had fallen almost fainting in my arms to
be brief those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an
instant they came down carrying hadji morato with his hands bound and a
napkin tied over his mouth which prevented him from uttering a word
warning him at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his
life when his daughter caught sight of him she covered her eyes so as
not to see him and her father was horror stricken not knowing how
willingly she had placed herself in our hands but it was now most
essential for us to be on the move and carefully and quickly we regained
the vessel where those who had remained on board were waiting for us in
apprehension of some mishap having befallen us it was barely two hours
after night set in when we were all on board the vessel where the cords
were removed from the hands of zoraidas father and the napkin from his
mouth but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word or they
would take his life he when he saw his daughter there began to sigh
piteously and still more when he perceived that i held her closely
embraced and that she lay quiet without resisting or complaining or
showing any reluctance nevertheless he remained silent lest they should
carry into effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him
finding herself now on board and that we were about to give way with the
oars zoraida seeing her father there and the other moors bound bade
the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the moors and
setting her father at liberty for she would rather drown herself in the
sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away
captive before her eyes and on her account the renegade repeated this to
me and i replied that i was very willing to do so but he replied that
it was not advisable because if they were left there they would at once
raise the country and stir up the city and lead to the despatch of swift
cruisers in pursuit and our being taken by sea or land without any
possibility of escape and that all that could be done was to set them
free on the first christian ground we reached on this point we all
agreed and zoraida to whom it was explained together with the reasons
that prevented us from doing at once what she desired was satisfied
likewise and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our
stout rowers took his oar and commending ourselves to god with all our
hearts we began to shape our course for the island of majorca the
nearest christian land owing however to the tramontana rising a
little and the sea growing somewhat rough it was impossible for us to
keep a straight course for majorca and we were compelled to coast in the
direction of oran not without great uneasiness on our part lest we
should be observed from the town of shershel which lies on that coast
not more than sixty miles from algiers moreover we were afraid of
meeting on that course one of the galliots that usually come with goods
from tetuan although each of us for himself and all of us together felt
confident that if we were to meet a merchant galliot so that it were
not a cruiser not only should we not be lost but that we should take a
vessel in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage as we pursued
our course zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her
father and i felt that she was praying to lela marien to help us
we might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three
musket shots off the land which seemed to us deserted and without
anyone to see us for all that however by hard rowing we put out a
little to sea for it was now somewhat calmer and having gained about
two leagues the word was given to row by batches while we ate something
for the vessel was well provided but the rowers said it was not a time
to take any rest let food be served out to those who were not rowing
but they would not leave their oars on any account this was done but
now a stiff breeze began to blow which obliged us to leave off rowing
and make sail at once and steer for oran as it was impossible to make
any other course all this was done very promptly and under sail we ran
more than eight miles an hour without any fear except that of coming
across some vessel out on a roving expedition we gave the moorish rowers
some food and the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were
not held as captives as we should set them free on the first
the same was said to zoraidas father who replied anything else
christian i might hope for or think likely from your generosity and good
behaviour but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me
my liberty for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of
depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously especially as
you know who i am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it
and if you will only name that i here offer you all you require for
myself and for my unhappy daughter there or else for her alone for she
is the greatest and most precious part of my soul
as he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with
compassion and forced zoraida to look at him and when she saw him
weeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her
arms round him and pressing her face to his they both gave way to such
an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them
but when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about
her he said to her in his own language what means this my daughter
last night before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged
befell us i saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments and now
without having had time to attire thyself and without my bringing thee
any joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking
thyself i see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power
to give thee when fortune was most kind to us answer me this for it
causes me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune itself
the renegade interpreted to us what the moor said to his daughter she
however returned him no answer but when he observed in one corner of
the vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels which
he well knew he had left in algiers and had not brought to the garden he
was still more amazed and asked her how that trunk had come into our
hands and what there was in it to which the renegade without waiting
for zoraida to reply made answer do not trouble thyself by asking thy
daughter zoraida so many questions senor for the one answer i will give
thee will serve for all i would have thee know that she is a christian
and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer
from captivity she is here of her own free will as glad i imagine to
find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the
light from death to life and from suffering to glory
daughter is this true what he says cried the moor
that thou art in truth a christian said the old man and that thou
hast given thy father into the power of his enemies
to which zoraida made answer a christian i am but it is not i who have
placed thee in this position for it never was my wish to leave thee or
do thee harm but only to do good to myself
and what good hast thou done thyself daughter said he
ask thou that said she of lela marien for she can tell thee better
the moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he
flung himself headforemost into the sea where no doubt he would have
been drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a
little on the surface of the water zoraida cried aloud to us to save
him and we all hastened to help and seizing him by his robe we drew him
in half drowned and insensible at which zoraida was in such distress
that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were
already dead we turned him upon his face and he voided a great quantity
of water and at the end of two hours came to himself meanwhile the
wind having changed we were compelled to head for the land and ply our
oars to avoid being driven on shore but it was our good fortune to reach
a creek that lies on one side of a small promontory or cape called by
the moors that of the cava rumia which in our language means the
wicked christian woman for it is a tradition among them that la cava
through whom spain was lost lies buried at that spot cava in their
language meaning wicked woman and rumia christian moreover they
count it unlucky to anchor there when necessity compels them and they
never do so otherwise for us however it was not the resting place of
the wicked woman but a haven of safety for our relief so much had the
sea now got up we posted a look out on shore and never let the oars out
of our hands and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in imploring
god and our lady with all our hearts to help and protect us that we
might give a happy ending to a beginning so prosperous at the entreaty
of zoraida orders were given to set on shore her father and the other
moors who were still bound for she could not endure nor could her
tender heart bear to see her father in bonds and her fellow countrymen
prisoners before her eyes we promised her to do this at the moment of
departure for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at
our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by heaven for after
a while the wind changed in our favour and made the sea calm inviting
us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart seeing this we
unbound the moors and one by one put them on shore at which they were
filled with amazement but when we came to land zoraidas father who had
why is it think ye christians that this wicked woman is rejoiced at
your giving me my liberty think ye it is because of the affection she
bears me nay verily it is only because of the hindrance my presence
offers to the execution of her base designs and think not that it is her
belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change her
religion it is only because she knows that immodesty is more freely
practised in your country than in ours then turning to zoraida while i
and another of the christians held him fast by both arms lest he should
do some mad act he said to her infamous girl misguided maiden
whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these
dogs our natural enemies cursed be the hour when i begot thee cursed
the luxury and indulgence in which i reared thee
but seeing that he was not likely soon to cease i made haste to put him
on shore and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations
aloud calling on mohammed to pray to allah to destroy us to confound
us to make an end of us and when in consequence of having made sail
we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did how he
plucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground
but once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear
what he said come back dear daughter come back to shore i forgive
thee all let those men have the money for it is theirs now and come
back to comfort thy sorrowing father who will yield up his life on this
all this zoraida heard and heard with sorrow and tears and all she
could say in answer was allah grant that lela marien who has made me
become a christian give thee comfort in thy sorrow my father allah
knows that i could not do otherwise than i have done and that these
christians owe nothing to my will for even had i wished not to accompany
them but remain at home it would have been impossible for me so
eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose
which i feel to be as righteous as to thee dear father it seems
but neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this
and so while i consoled zoraida we turned our attention to our voyage
in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure
of finding ourselves off the coast of spain on the morrow by daybreak
but as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed without being
attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it
our fortune or perhaps the curses which the moor had hurled at his
daughter for whatever kind of father they may come from these are always
to be dreaded brought it about that when we were now in mid sea and
the night about three hours spent as we were running with all sail set
and oars lashed for the favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using
them we saw by the light of the moon which shone brilliantly a
square rigged vessel in full sail close to us luffing up and standing
across our course and so close that we had to strike sail to avoid
running foul of her while they too put the helm hard up to let us pass
they came to the side of the ship to ask who we were whither we were
bound and whence we came but as they asked this in french our renegade
said let no one answer for no doubt these are french corsairs who
acting on this warning no one answered a word but after we had gone a
little ahead and the vessel was now lying to leeward suddenly they
fired two guns and apparently both loaded with chain shot for with one
they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the
sea and the other discharged at the same moment sent a ball into our
vessel amidships staving her in completely but without doing any
further damage we however finding ourselves sinking began to shout for
help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning
to fill they then lay to and lowering a skiff or boat as many as a
dozen frenchmen well armed with match locks and their matches burning
got into it and came alongside and seeing how few we were and that our
vessel was going down they took us in telling us that this had come to
us through our incivility in not giving them an answer our renegade took
the trunk containing zoraidas wealth and dropped it into the sea without
anyone perceiving what he did in short we went on board with the
frenchmen who after having ascertained all they wanted to know about
us rifled us of everything we had as if they had been our bitterest
enemies and from zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her
feet but the distress they caused her did not distress me so much as the
fear i was in that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they
would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more
than all the desires however of those people do not go beyond money
but of that their covetousness is insatiable and on this occasion it was
carried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we
wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them it was the
advice of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail
for their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of spain giving
themselves out as bretons and if they brought us alive they would be
punished as soon as the robbery was discovered but the captain who was
the one who had plundered my beloved zoraida said he was satisfied with
the prize he had got and that he would not touch at any spanish port
but pass the straits of gibraltar by night or as best he could and make
for la rochelle from which he had sailed so they agreed by common
consent to give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required
for the short voyage that remained to us and this they did the next day
on coming in sight of the spanish coast with which and the joy we felt
all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they
had never been endured by us such is the delight of recovering lost
it may have been about mid day when they placed us in the boat giving us
two kegs of water and some biscuit and the captain moved by i know not
what compassion as the lovely zoraida was about to embark gave her some
forty gold crowns and would not permit his men to take from her those
same garments which she has on now we got into the boat returning them
thanks for their kindness to us and showing ourselves grateful rather
than indignant they stood out to sea steering for the straits we
without looking to any compass save the land we had before us set
ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that we
might easily we thought land before the night was far advanced but as
the moon did not show that night and the sky was clouded and as we knew
not whereabouts we were it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make
for the shore as several of us advised saying we ought to run ourselves
ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation for in this
way we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the
prowling vessels of the tetuan corsairs who leave barbary at nightfall
and are on the spanish coast by daybreak where they commonly take some
prize and then go home to sleep in their own houses but of the
conflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should
approach gradually and land where we could if the sea were calm enough
to permit us this was done and a little before midnight we drew near to
the foot of a huge and lofty mountain not so close to the sea but that
it left a narrow space on which to land conveniently we ran our boat up
on the sand and all sprang out and kissed the ground and with tears of
joyful satisfaction returned thanks to god our lord for all his
incomparable goodness to us on our voyage we took out of the boat the
provisions it contained and drew it up on the shore and then climbed a
long way up the mountain for even there we could not feel easy in our
hearts or persuade ourselves that it was christian soil that was now
the dawn came more slowly i think than we could have wished we
completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation or
any shepherds huts could be discovered but strain our eyes as we might
neither dwelling nor human being nor path nor road could we perceive
however we determined to push on farther as it could not but be that
ere long we must see some one who could tell us where we were but what
distressed me most was to see zoraida going on foot over that rough
ground for though i once carried her on my shoulders she was more
wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest and so she would never
again allow me to undergo the exertion and went on very patiently and
cheerfully while i led her by the hand we had gone rather less than a
quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears a
clear proof that there were flocks hard by and looking about carefully
to see if any were within view we observed a young shepherd tranquilly
and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork
tree we called to him and he raising his head sprang nimbly to his
feet for as we afterwards learned the first who presented themselves
to his sight were the renegade and zoraida and seeing them in moorish
dress he imagined that all the moors of barbary were upon him and
plunging with marvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him he
began to raise a prodigious outcry exclaiming the moors the moors
have landed to arms to arms we were all thrown into perplexity by
these cries not knowing what to do but reflecting that the shouts of
the shepherd would raise the country and that the mounted coast guard
would come at once to see what was the matter we agreed that the
renegade must strip off his turkish garments and put on a captives
jacket or coat which one of our party gave him at once though he himself
was reduced to his shirt and so commending ourselves to god we followed
the same road which we saw the shepherd take expecting every moment that
the coast guard would be down upon us nor did our expectation deceive
us for two hours had not passed when coming out of the brushwood into
the open ground we perceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching
us at a hand gallop as soon as we saw them we stood still waiting for
them but as they came close and instead of the moors they were in quest
of saw a set of poor christians they were taken aback and one of them
asked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having raised
the call to arms i said yes and as i was about to explain to him what
had occurred and whence we came and who we were one of the christians
of our party recognised the horseman who had put the question to us and
before i could say anything more he exclaimed
thanks be to god sirs for bringing us to such good quarters for if i
do not deceive myself the ground we stand on is that of velez malaga
unless indeed all my years of captivity have made me unable to
recollect that you senor who ask who we are are pedro de bustamante
the christian captive had hardly uttered these words when the horseman
threw himself off his horse and ran to embrace the young man crying
nephew of my soul and life i recognise thee now and long have i
mourned thee as dead i and my sister thy mother and all thy kin that
are still alive and whom god has been pleased to preserve that they may
enjoy the happiness of seeing thee we knew long since that thou wert in
algiers and from the appearance of thy garments and those of all this
company i conclude that ye have had a miraculous restoration to
it is true replied the young man and by and by we will tell you
as soon as the horsemen understood that we were christian captives they
dismounted from their horses and each offered his to carry us to the
city of velez malaga which was a league and a half distant some of them
went to bring the boat to the city we having told them where we had left
it others took us up behind them and zoraida was placed on the horse of
the young mans uncle the whole town came out to meet us for they had
by this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance
they were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive moors for
people on that coast are well used to see both one and the other but
they were astonished at the beauty of zoraida which was just then
heightened as well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding
herself on christian soil and relieved of all fear of being lost for
this had brought such a glow upon her face that unless my affection for
her were deceiving me i would venture to say that there was not a more
beautiful creature in the world at least that i had ever seen we went
straight to the church to return thanks to god for the mercies we had
received and when zoraida entered it she said there were faces there
like lela mariens we told her they were her images and as well as he
could the renegade explained to her what they meant that she might adore
them as if each of them were the very same lela marien that had spoken to
her and she having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct
understood at once all he said to her about them thence they took us
away and distributed us all in different houses in the town but as for
the renegade zoraida and myself the christian who came with us brought
us to the house of his parents who had a fair share of the gifts of
fortune and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son
we remained six days in velez at the end of which the renegade having
informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do set out for the
city of granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the church
through the medium of the holy inquisition the other released captives
took their departures each the way that seemed best to him and zoraida
and i were left alone with nothing more than the crowns which the
courtesy of the frenchman had bestowed upon zoraida out of which i
bought the beast on which she rides and i for the present attending her
as her father and squire and not as her husband we are now going to
ascertain if my father is living or if any of my brothers has had better
fortune than mine has been though as heaven has made me the companion
of zoraida i think no other lot could be assigned to me however happy
that i would rather have the patience with which she endures the
hardships that poverty brings with it and the eagerness she shows to
become a christian are such that they fill me with admiration and bind
me to serve her all my life though the happiness i feel in seeing myself
hers and her mine is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether i
shall find any corner to shelter her in my own country or whether time
and death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my
father and brothers that i shall hardly find anyone who knows me if
i have no more of my story to tell you gentlemen whether it be an
interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide all i can
say is i would gladly have told it to you more briefly although my fear
of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance
which treats of what further took place in the inn and of several other
with these words the captive held his peace and don fernando said to
him in truth captain the manner in which you have related this
remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and
strangeness of the matter the whole story is curious and uncommon and
abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and
astonishment and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to
it that we should be glad if it were to begin again even though
to morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale and while
he said this cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to
him in any way that lay in their power and in words and language so
kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their
good will in particular don fernando offered if he would go back with
him to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism of
zoraida and on his own part to provide him with the means of making his
appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was entitled
to for all this the captive returned thanks very courteously although
he would not accept any of their generous offers
by this time night closed in and as it did there came up to the inn a
coach attended by some men on horseback who demanded accommodation to
which the landlady replied that there was not a hands breadth of the
still for all that said one of those who had entered on horseback
room must be found for his lordship the judge here
at this name the landlady was taken aback and said senor the fact is
i have no beds but if his lordship the judge carries one with him as no
doubt he does let him come in and welcome for my husband and i will
give up our room to accommodate his worship
very good so be it said the squire but in the meantime a man had got
out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he
held for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he
was as his servant said a judge of appeal he led by the hand a young
girl in a travelling dress apparently about sixteen years of age and of
such a high bred air so beautiful and so graceful that all were filled
with admiration when she made her appearance and but for having seen
dorothea luscinda and zoraida who were there in the inn they would
have fancied that a beauty like that of this maidens would have been
hard to find don quixote was present at the entrance of the judge with
the young lady and as soon as he saw him he said your worship may with
confidence enter and take your ease in this castle for though the
accommodation be scanty and poor there are no quarters so cramped or
inconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters above all
if arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader as letters
represented by your worship have in this fair maiden to whom not only
ought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up but rocks
should rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves
down to give her a reception enter your worship i say into this
paradise for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven
your worship brings with you here you will find arms in their supreme
the judge was struck with amazement at the language of don quixote whom
he scrutinized very carefully no less astonished by his figure than by
his talk and before he could find words to answer him he had a fresh
surprise when he saw opposite to him luscinda dorothea and zoraida
who having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady
had come to see her and welcome her don fernando cardenio and the
curate however greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style
in short the judge made his entrance in a state of bewilderment as well
with what he saw as what he heard and the fair ladies of the inn gave
the fair damsel a cordial welcome on the whole he could perceive that
all who were there were people of quality but with the figure
countenance and bearing of don quixote he was at his wits end and all
civilities having been exchanged and the accommodation of the inn
inquired into it was settled as it had been before settled that all
the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned
and that the men should remain outside as if to guard them the judge
therefore was very well pleased to allow his daughter for such the
damsel was to go with the ladies which she did very willingly and with
part of the hosts narrow bed and half of what the judge had brought with
him they made a more comfortable arrangement for the night than they had
the captive whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the
judge telling him somehow that this was his brother asked one of the
servants who accompanied him what his name was and whether he knew from
what part of the country he came the servant replied that he was called
the licentiate juan perez de viedma and that he had heard it said he
came from a village in the mountains of leon from this statement and
what he himself had seen he felt convinced that this was his brother who
had adopted letters by his fathers advice and excited and rejoiced he
called don fernando and cardenio and the curate aside and told them how
the matter stood assuring them that the judge was his brother the
servant had further informed him that he was now going to the indies with
the appointment of judge of the supreme court of mexico and he had
learned likewise that the young lady was his daughter whose mother had
died in giving birth to her and that he was very rich in consequence of
the dowry left to him with the daughter he asked their advice as to what
means he should adopt to make himself known or to ascertain beforehand
whether when he had made himself known his brother seeing him so poor
would be ashamed of him or would receive him with a warm heart
leave it to me to find out that said the curate though there is no
reason for supposing senor captain that you will not be kindly
received because the worth and wisdom that your brothers bearing shows
him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty or
insensible or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents of
still said the captain i would not make myself known abruptly but
i have told you already said the curate that i will manage it in a
by this time supper was ready and they all took their seats at the
table except the captive and the ladies who supped by themselves in
their own room in the middle of supper the curate said
i had a comrade of your worships name senor judge in constantinople
where i was a captive for several years and that same comrade was one of
the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole spanish infantry but he
had as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage
and how was the captain called senor asked the judge
he was called ruy perez de viedma replied the curate and he was born
in a village in the mountains of leon and he mentioned a circumstance
connected with his father and his brothers which had it not been told me
by so truthful a man as he was i should have set down as one of those
fables the old women tell over the fire in winter for he said his father
had divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words of
advice to them sounder than any of catos but i can say this much that
the choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success
that by his gallant conduct and courage and without any help save his
own merit he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry and to see
himself on the high road and in position to be given the command of a
corps before long but fortune was against him for where he might have
expected her favour he lost it and with it his liberty on that glorious
day when so many recovered theirs at the battle of lepanto i lost mine
at the goletta and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves
comrades at constantinople thence he went to algiers where he met with
one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the
here the curate went on to relate briefly his brothers adventure with
zoraida to all which the judge gave such an attentive hearing that he
never before had been so much of a hearer the curate however only went
so far as to describe how the frenchmen plundered those who were in the
boat and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair moor
were left of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of
them or whether they had reached spain or been carried to france by the
the captain standing a little to one side was listening to all the
curate said and watching every movement of his brother who as soon as
he perceived the curate had made an end of his story gave a deep sigh
and said with his eyes full of tears oh senor if you only knew what
news you have given me and how it comes home to me making me show how i
feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my
worldly wisdom and self restraint that brave captain that you speak of
is my eldest brother who being of a bolder and loftier mind than my
other brother or myself chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms
which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us as your
comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you i
followed that of letters in which god and my own exertions have raised
me to the position in which you see me my second brother is in peru so
wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully
repaid the portion he took with him and has even furnished my fathers
hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity while i too
have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable
fashion and so to attain my present standing my father is still alive
though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son and he prays god
unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he has looked upon
those of his son but with regard to him what surprises me is that
having so much common sense as he had he should have neglected to give
any intelligence about himself either in his troubles and sufferings or
in his prosperity for if his father or any of us had known of his
condition he need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain
his ransom but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those
frenchmen may have restored him to liberty or murdered him to hide the
robbery all this will make me continue my journey not with the
satisfaction in which i began it but in the deepest melancholy and
sadness oh dear brother that i only knew where thou art now and i
would hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thy sufferings
though it were to cost me suffering myself oh that i could bring news to
our old father that thou art alive even wert thou the deepest dungeon of
barbary for his wealth and my brothers and mine would rescue thee
thence oh beautiful and generous zoraida that i could repay thy good
goodness to a brother that i could be present at the new birth of thy
soul and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness
all this and more the judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he
had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it showing
their sympathy with his sorrow the curate seeing then how well he had
succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captains wishes had no
desire to keep them unhappy any longer so he rose from the table and
going into the room where zoraida was he took her by the hand luscinda
dorothea and the judges daughter following her the captain was waiting
to see what the curate would do when the latter taking him with the
other hand advanced with both of them to where the judge and the other
gentlemen were and said let your tears cease to flow senor judge and
the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire for you
have before you your worthy brother and your good sister in law he whom
you see here is the captain viedma and this is the fair moor who has
been so good to him the frenchmen i told you of have reduced them to the
state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind
the captain ran to embrace his brother who placed both hands on his
breast so as to have a good look at him holding him a little way off but
as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so
closely shedding such tears of heartfelt joy that most of those present
could not but join in them the words the brothers exchanged the emotion
they showed can scarcely be imagined i fancy much less put down in
writing they told each other in a few words the events of their lives
they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength then the
judge embraced zoraida putting all he possessed at her disposal then he
made his daughter embrace her and the fair christian and the lovely moor
drew fresh tears from every eye and there was don quixote observing all
these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word and
attributing the whole to chimeras of knight errantry then they agreed
that the captain and zoraida should return with his brother to seville
and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found so as
to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of
zoraida for it was impossible for the judge to put off his journey as
he was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from
seville for new spain and to miss the passage would have been a great
inconvenience to him in short everybody was well pleased and glad at
the captives good fortune and as now almost two thirds of the night
were past they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it don
quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be
attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel covetous of the
great treasure of beauty the castle contained those who understood him
returned him thanks for this service and they gave the judge an account
of his extraordinary humour with which he was not a little amused
sancho panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to
rest and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable as he
stretched himself on the trappings of his ass which as will be told
the ladies then having retired to their chamber and the others having
disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could don quixote
sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had
promised it happened however that a little before the approach of dawn
a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it
forced them all to listen attentively but especially dorothea who had
been awake and by whose side dona clara de viedma for so the judges
daughter was called lay sleeping no one could imagine who it was that
sang so sweetly and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument at
one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard at
another in the stable and as they were all attention wondering
cardenio came to the door and said listen whoever is not asleep and
you will hear a muleteers voice that enchants as it chants
we are listening to it already senor said dorothea on which cardenio
went away and dorothea giving all her attention to it made out the
wherein is related the pleasant story of the muleteer together with
other strange things that came to pass in the inn
when most i need it these like clouds
when thou shalt hide thee from my sight
the singer had got so far when it struck dorothea that it was not fair to
let clara miss hearing such a sweet voice so shaking her from side to
forgive me child for waking thee but i do so that thou mayest have
the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard perhaps in
clara awoke quite drowsy and not understanding at the moment what
dorothea said asked her what it was she repeated what she had said and
clara became attentive at once but she had hardly heard two lines as
the singer continued when a strange trembling seized her as if she were
suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague and throwing her arms
ah dear lady of my soul and life why did you wake me the greatest
kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as
neither to see or hear that unhappy musician
what art thou talking about child said dorothea why they say this
nay he is the lord of many places replied clara and that one in my
heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him unless he
dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl for it seemed to
be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any
you speak in such a way that i cannot understand you senora clara
explain yourself more clearly and tell me what is this you are saying
about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you
but do not tell me anything now i do not want to lose the pleasure i get
from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports
for i perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air
let him in heavens name returned clara and not to hear him she
stopped both ears with her hands at which dorothea was again surprised
but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this
that onward to the goal of thy intent
if at each step thou findest death is near
no joy of triumph doth the faint heart know
that a bold front to fortune dares not show
do dearly sell his right must be contest
with that whereon his stamp he hath imprest
what costeth little that we rate but low
shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there
here the voice ceased and claras sobs began afresh all which excited
dorotheas curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet
and weeping so bitter so she again asked her what it was she was going
to say before on this clara afraid that luscinda might overhear her
winding her arms tightly round dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear
that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else and
this singer dear senora is the son of a gentleman of aragon lord of
two villages who lives opposite my fathers house at madrid and though
my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter and
lattice work in summer in some way i know not how this gentleman who
was pursuing his studies saw me whether in church or elsewhere i
cannot tell and in fact fell in love with me and gave me to know it
from the windows of his house with so many signs and tears that i was
forced to believe him and even to love him without knowing what it was
he wanted of me one of the signs he used to make me was to link one hand
in the other to show me he wished to marry me and though i should have
been glad if that could be being alone and motherless i knew not whom to
open my mind to and so i left it as it was showing him no favour
except when my father and his too were from home to raise the curtain
or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly at which he would
show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad meanwhile the
time for my fathers departure arrived which he became aware of but not
from me for i had never been able to tell him of it he fell sick of
grief i believe and so the day we were going away i could not see him to
take farewell of him were it only with the eyes but after we had been
two days on the road on entering the posada of a village a days journey
from this i saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer and so
well disguised that if i did not carry his image graven on my heart it
would have been impossible for me to recognise him but i knew him and i
was surprised and glad he watched me unsuspected by my father from
whom he always hides himself when he crosses my path on the road or in
the posadas where we halt and as i know what he is and reflect that
for love of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship i am
ready to die of sorrow and where he sets foot there i set my eyes i
know not with what object he has come or how he could have got away from
his father who loves him beyond measure having no other heir and
because he deserves it as you will perceive when you see him and
moreover i can tell you all that he sings is out of his own head for i
have heard them say he is a great scholar and poet and what is more
every time i see him or hear him sing i tremble all over and am
terrified lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our
loves i have never spoken a word to him in my life and for all that i
love him so that i could not live without him this dear senora is all
i have to tell you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so
much and from it alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer but
a lord of hearts and towns as i told you already
say no more dona clara said dorothea at this at the same time
kissing her a thousand times over say no more i tell you but wait
till day comes when i trust in god to arrange this affair of yours so
that it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves
ah senora said dona clara what end can be hoped for when his father
is of such lofty position and so wealthy that he would think i was not
fit to be even a servant to his son much less wife and as to marrying
without the knowledge of my father i would not do it for all the world
i would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and
leave me perhaps with not seeing him and the long distance we shall
have to travel the pain i suffer now may become easier though i daresay
the remedy i propose will do me very little good i dont know how the
devil this has come about or how this love i have for him got in i such
a young girl and he such a mere boy for i verily believe we are both of
an age and i am not sixteen yet for i will be sixteen michaelmas day
dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child dona clara
spoke let us go to sleep now senora said she for the little of the
night that i fancy is left to us god will soon send us daylight and we
will set all to rights or it will go hard with me
with this they fell asleep and deep silence reigned all through the inn
the only persons not asleep were the landladys daughter and her servant
maritornes who knowing the weak point of don quixotes humour and that
he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback
resolved the pair of them to play some trick upon him or at any rate
to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense as it so
happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards
except a hole in the wall of a straw loft through which they used to
throw out the straw at this hole the two demi damsels posted themselves
and observed don quixote on his horse leaning on his pike and from time
to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs that he seemed to
pluck up his soul by the roots with each of them and they could hear
him too saying in a soft tender loving tone oh my lady dulcinea del
toboso perfection of all beauty summit and crown of discretion
treasure house of grace depositary of virtue and finally ideal of all
that is good honourable and delectable in this world what is thy grace
doing now art thou perchance mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his
own free will hath exposed himself to so great perils and all to serve
thee give me tidings of her oh luminary of the three faces perhaps at
this moment envious of hers thou art regarding her either as she paces
to and fro some gallery of her sumptuous palaces or leans over some
balcony meditating how whilst preserving her purity and greatness she
may mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her
sake what glory should recompense my sufferings what repose my toil
and lastly what death my life and what reward my services and thou oh
sun that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise
betimes and come forth to see my lady when thou seest her i entreat of
thee to salute her on my behalf but have a care when thou shalt see her
and salute her that thou kiss not her face for i shall be more jealous
of thee than thou wert of that light footed ingrate that made thee sweat
and run so on the plains of thessaly or on the banks of the peneus for
i do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion
don quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landladys
daughter began to signal to him saying senor come over here please
at these signals and voice don quixote turned his head and saw by the
light of the moon which then was in its full splendour that some one
was calling to him from the hole in the wall which seemed to him to be a
window and what is more with a gilt grating as rich castles such as
he believed the inn to be ought to have and it immediately suggested
itself to his imagination that as on the former occasion the fair
damsel the daughter of the lady of the castle overcome by love for him
was once more endeavouring to win his affections and with this idea not
to show himself discourteous or ungrateful he turned rocinantes head
and approached the hole and as he perceived the two wenches he said
