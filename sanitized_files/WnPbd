affairs which called for some decisive action their town house and
estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to
go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their
natasha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed
lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every
day the thought that her best days which she would have employed in
loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone
tormented her incessantly his letters for the most part irritated her
it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he
was living a real life seeing new places and new people that interested
him the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt her
letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a
wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she
could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter
even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile and
glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which
she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the
there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was
impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer natashas
trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrew
was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending the
winter and natasha felt sure he had already arrived
so the countess remained in the country and the count taking sonya and
natasha with him went to moscow at the end of january
after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent
cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly
convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and
happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had
devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished
after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph
alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only
the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now
enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all
petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this
life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping
a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club
again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor
sets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary
to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she was right and
to avoid compromising her went away to moscow
in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as
driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square
with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of
the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried
nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old
moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself
at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and
moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre
like a long expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him
for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual
merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of
the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to
churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him and
had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and
taken him under their protection he would have given everything away
there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as
he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was
surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were
quarrels his kindly smile and well timed jests reconciled the
antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at
balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and
unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was
equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il
na pas de sexe  they said of him
pierre was one of those retired gentlemen in waiting of whom there were
hundreds good humoredly ending their days in moscow
how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first
arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to
seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally
predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his
position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time
longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then
himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a
strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the
possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful
human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection
had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs
but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an
unfaithful wife a retired gentleman in waiting fond of eating and
drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government
a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in
moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
idea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemen in waiting
sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily
with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single
in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him
that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
gentlemen in waiting he had formerly despised they were empty stupid
contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still
discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these
comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path
in life of their own and like me were brought by force of
circumstances society and race by that elemental force against which
man is powerless to the condition i am in said he to himself in
moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer
despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his
pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust
with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment what
for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in
perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew
on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that
there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from
them and took up a book or hurried off to the club or to apollon
nikolaevichs to exchange the gossip of the town
helene who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of
the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded by
people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage
to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great
but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants
to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through
the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over the
french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the
catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june
they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood that
they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do
not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they
intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an
authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning
of which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all profess
the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors
the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty
churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister
of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a
cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of
this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to
it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand
the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all
that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the
depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it
so it appears that it must be so but i what is to become of me
thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially
russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness
and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to
be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was
connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to
be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him
and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find
occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these
insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order
to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought
pictures engaged in building and above all read
he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while
his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and
began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to
gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women
from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more
and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors
warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank
a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several
glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a
readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some
aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the
influence of wine he said to himself it doesnt matter ill get it
unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time now ill think it
all out later on but the later on never came
in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as
insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and
if anyone came to see him he was glad
sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
entrenched under the enemys fire if they have nothing to do try hard
to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre
all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in
ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in
toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and
some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is
important its all the same only to save oneself from it as best one
can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it
at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughter
moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexanders
regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti french tendency prevailed
there and this together with his past and his intellect and his
originality at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of
particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow
the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of
senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent
events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which
he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this
the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his old
fashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt
stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms
of the present for them all that old fashioned house with its gigantic
mirrors pre revolution furniture powdered footmen and the stern
shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle
daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him
presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not
reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their
host there were also twenty two hours in the day during which the
private and intimate life of the house continued
latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary
there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with
the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she
had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go
out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go
anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out
himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she
had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom
she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to
her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow
was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young
men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth
julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a
mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose
presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the
old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
evenings for years she regretted julies presence and having no one to
write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom
to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the
time for prince andrews return and marriage was approaching but his
request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in
fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention
of the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that was
usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added
sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year old nephew to her
consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas
some symptoms of her fathers irritability however often she told
herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost
every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french
alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily
into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment
get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled became
flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the
arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would
herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas
following her example would sob and without permission would leave his
corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her
but what distressed the princess most of all was her fathers
irritability which was always directed against her and had of late
amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it
would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this
loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her
deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for
everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess
mary more than anything else this was his ever increasing intimacy with
mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving
the news of his sons intentions had occurred to him in jest that if
andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently
pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to
princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the
companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
one day in moscow in princess marys presence she thought her father
did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle
bouriennes hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately
princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later
mademoiselle bourienne came into princess marys room smiling and making
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped
away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and
evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking its horrible vile
inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish
leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs
next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be
served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw
his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him
he doesnt obey i said it twice and he doesnt obey she is the
first person in this house shes my best friend cried the prince
and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess
mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you
dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go
dont let me set eyes on you beg her pardon
princess mary asked mademoiselle bouriennes pardon and also her
fathers pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged
at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or
would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness
or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head
sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him
she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against
in 1811 there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who had
rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable as
frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever
doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but
prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on
mademoiselle bouriennes advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice
on december 6 st nicholas day and the princes name day all moscow
came to the princes front door but he gave orders to admit no one and
to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to
metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it
proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne  as he told
princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that
morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had
been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she
went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and
awaited the inevitable explosion until the doctors arrival the morning
had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat
down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
could hear all that passed in the study
at first she heard only metiviers voice then her fathers then both
voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on
the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier
with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and
fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
you dont understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slave
of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell you
metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who
at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room
the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep
calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his
through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry
spies traitors traitors everywhere not a moments peace in my own
after metiviers departure the old prince called his daughter in and
the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy
had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list
and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that
scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he
could not have a moments peace and could not die quietly
no maam we must part we must part understand that understand it
i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if
afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying
to appear calm added and dont imagine i have said this in a moment of
anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried out we
must part so find some place for yourself but he could not
restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is
capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and
if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for
at two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner
these guests the famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with his
nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the princes and of the
younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoy awaited the prince in
boris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been
anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house
the princes house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
society but his little circle though not much talked about in town
was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other boris
had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his
presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and
rostopchin had replied that he could not come
on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince
oh yes yes replied the commander in chief how is he
the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old fashioned
drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a
court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince
nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter
and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address her
feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchin
alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news
lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation
prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only
now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of
what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as
indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or
giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the
point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself
at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleons
seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and the russian note
hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts
bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count
rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one
only wonders at the long suffering or blindness of the crowned heads
now the popes turn has come and bonaparte doesnt scruple to depose the
head of the catholic church yet all keep silent our sovereign alone
has protested against the seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory
and even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the
other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of
oldenburg said prince bolkonski he shifts the dukes about as i might
move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates
the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of
character and resignation remarked boris joining in respectfully
he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor
of being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at the young
man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind
i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised
how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casual
tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him
pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understanding
why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note
does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as
my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy
to have a good style returned count rostopchin
pierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording of
one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked
the old prince there in petersburg they are always writing not notes
only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of
laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed
there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared
did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure
eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his majestys
his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march
past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no
notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention
to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next
review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him
all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was
impudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned him
out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him in spite of
my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily
and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the
reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasons
were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder
after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate
the old prince princess mary too went round to him
he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he
had not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision remained in
force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to
when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old
prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european
affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we ought
not to fight either for or against austria our political interests are
all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an
armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the
russian frontier as was the case in 1807
how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can we
arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youths
look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom of
he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone
french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned
metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a
scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to a
party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman
catholics and had the popes indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays
and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our
public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people
prince one would like to take peter the greats old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps
all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and
well good by your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting up
with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince
good bye my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of
hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering
princess mary as she sat listening to the old mens talk and
faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered
whether the guests had all observed her fathers hostile attitude toward
her she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities
shown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy who was visiting them for
princess mary turned with absent minded questioning look to pierre who
hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into
oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked
pierre was in an agreeable after dinner mood he looked straight before
have you known that young man long princess he asked
yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said
princess mary still thinking of that mornings conversation with her
because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now manages
matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i can
read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to
you or mademoiselle julie karagina he is very attentive to her
yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said pierre
with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored
raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary
to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very
really asked princess mary looking into pierres kindly face and
still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she
if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone i should like to
tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would be a
oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody she
cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice ah how
bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went
on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve
him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only one
thing left to go away but where could i go
but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into
i dont know what is the matter with me today dont take any notice
pierres gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the
princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that
she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble
except the one he knew of that prince andrews marriage threatened to
have you any news of the rostovs she asked to change the subject i
was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i
and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to the
what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing is
impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments i
wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have
known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly the whole
truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of her the real
truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his
fathers will that i should like to know
an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and repeated
requests to be told the whole truth expressed ill will on the princess
part toward her future sister in law and a wish that he should
disapprove of andrews choice but in reply he said what he felt rather
i dont know how to answer your question he said blushing without
knowing why i really dont know what sort of girl she is i cant
analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i dont
know that is all one can say about her
princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes thats
i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be
clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all
ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do
i hear they are expected very soon said pierre
princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sister in law as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the
boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with
the same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between the
two richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess mary
despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie he
without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they
had last met on the old princes name day she had answered at random
all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what
julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a
she was twenty seven after the death of her brothers she had become
very wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not
merely as good looking as before but even far more attractive she was
confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate
with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated
company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation a
man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to
the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of
compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance
that winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable in
moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large
company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight
and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a
promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion but
in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love
or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder she
adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a
girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
much in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing
herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
passing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paid
his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused
himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts
rimes which were in vogue at the karagins only a few of these young
men among them boris entered more deeply into julies melancholy and
with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of
all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with
to boris julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early
disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship as
she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him her
album boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic trees
your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me
on another page he drew a tomb and wrote
la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille ah contre les
ah from suffering there is no other refuge
there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said
to boris repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book
it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness and
aliment de poison dune ame trop sensible toi sans qui le bonheur me
serait impossible tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler viens
calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite et mele une douceur secrete
poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul thou without whom
happiness would for me be impossible tender melancholy ah come to
console me come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat and mingle a
secret sweetness with these tears that i feel to be flowing
for boris julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp boris read
poor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading
because of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatherings
julie and boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood
one another in a world of indifferent people
anna mikhaylovna who often visited the karagins while playing cards
with the mother made careful inquiries as to julies dowry she was to
have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests anna mikhaylovna
regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie
with emotion and resignation to the divine will
you are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the
daughter boris says his soul finds repose at your house he has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to the
mother ah my dear i cant tell you how fond i have grown of julie
latterly she said to her son but who could help loving her she is
an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how i pity her
mother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters from
penza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has no
one to help her and they do cheat her so
boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he
laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had to
say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and
julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her
for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a
feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
restrained boris his leave was expiring he spent every day and whole
days at the karagins and every day on thinking the matter over told
himself that he would propose tomorrow but in julies presence looking
at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and
her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to
an unnatural rapture of married bliss boris could not utter the
decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself as
the possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportioned
the use of the income from them julie saw boris indecision and
sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him but
her feminine self deception immediately supplied her with consolation
and she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy
however began to turn to irritability and not long before boris
departure she formed a definite plan of action just as boris leave of
absence was expiring anatole kuragin made his appearance in moscow and
of course in the karagins drawing room and julie suddenly abandoning
her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to kuragin
my dear said anna mikhaylovna to her son i know from a reliable
source that prince vasili has sent his son to moscow to get him married
to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her what do
the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
month of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all the
revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned
and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially
into the hands of that idiot anatole pained boris he drove to the
karagins with the firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gay
careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterdays ball
and asked when he was leaving though boris had come intentionally to
speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking
irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from
sadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be
paying court to them julie was offended and replied that it was true
that a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again would
then i should advise you boris began wishing to sting her but at
that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to
leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted
his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to happen
he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to
avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said
i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary
he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on
him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see her
often thought boris the affair has been begun and must be finished
he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said
there was no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and self
satisfaction but she forced boris to say all that is said on such
occasions that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
than her she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests she
could demand this and she received what she demanded
the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding
at the end of january old count rostov went to moscow with natasha and
sonya the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in
moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his
future daughter in law to old prince bolkonski while he was in moscow
could not be missed the rostovs moscow house had not been heated that
winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess was
not with them the count decided to stay with marya dmitrievna
akhrosimova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them
late one evening the rostovs four sleighs drove into marya dmitrievnas
courtyard in the old konyusheny street marya dmitrievna lived alone
she had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in the
she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly
loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to
others for any weakness passion or temptation the possibility of
which she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing
jacket she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out
on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
affairs of which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after
dressing she received petitioners of various classes of whom there
were always some then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal
at which there were always three or four guests after dinner she played
a game of boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read
to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to
pay visits and then only to the most important persons in the town
she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the pulley of
the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostovs and their
servants marya dmitrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose
and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern
grim face at the new arrivals one might have thought she was angry with
the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she not at the
same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the
the counts things bring them here she said pointing to the
portmanteaus and not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the
left now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids get the
samovar ready youve grown plumper and prettier she remarked
drawing natasha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the
hood foo you are cold now take off your things quick she shouted
to the count who was going to kiss her hand youre half frozen im
sure bring some rum for tea bonjour sonya dear she added
turning to sonya and indicating by this french greeting her slightly
when they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and
tidied themselves up after their journey marya dmitrievna kissed them
im heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it was high
time she said giving natasha a significant look the old man is here
and his sons expected any day youll have to make his acquaintance
but well speak of that later on she added glancing at sonya with a
look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence now
