conversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable
continued all through teatime all the grown up members of the family
were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided beside
the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea
and their voices were audible from the next room at tea all sat in
their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small table
where his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitch
daughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large black
eyes that seemed more prominent than ever lay on the armchair beside
him denisov whose curly hair mustache and whiskers had turned half
gray sat beside countess mary with his generals tunic unbuttoned
pierre sat between his wife and the old countess he spoke of what he
knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand he told
her of external social events and of the people who had formed the
circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living and
distinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about the
world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they
had sown in earlier years but to the old countess those contemporaries
of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society natasha saw by
pierres animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisov
not being a member of the family did not understand pierres caution
and being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring in
petersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in
the semenovsk regiment then about arakcheev and then about the bible
society once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of
these things but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the
health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna
well and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova denisov asked is
going on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society is
what is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished her
tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal what
are you saying about the government i dont understand
well you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate
things into his mothers language prince alexander golitsyn has
founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say
arakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the
whole government and what a government they see treason everywhere and
well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable man
i used to meet him at mary antonovnas said the countess in an
offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent
she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well and
what harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up too
and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
childrens voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly
finished finished little natashas gleeful yell rose above them all
pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he
it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countess
oh ill go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added
stopping at the door why im especially fond of that music it is
always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was driving
here today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as i
entered the anteroom i heard andrushas peals of laughter and that meant
i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i mustnt go there
those stockings are to be a surprise for me
pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew still
come anna makarovna pierres voice was heard saying come here into
the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when
i say three you stand here and you in my arms well now one
two said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturously
breathless cry of childrens voices filled the room two two they
this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to
herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same
needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drew
one out of the other in the childrens presence
soon after this the children came in to say good night they kissed
everyone the tutors and governesses made their bows and they went out
only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles whispered to the
no monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay replied
ma tante please let me stay said he going up to his aunt
his face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary
when you are here he cant tear himself away she said
i will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night said
pierre giving his hand to the swiss tutor and he turned to young
nicholas with a smile you and i havent seen anything of one another
yet how like he is growing mary he added addressing countess
like my father asked the boy flushing crimson and looking up at
pierre nodded and went on with what he had been saying when the
children had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork natasha
did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov rose asked
for their pipes smoked went to fetch more tea from sonya who sat
weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned pierre the curly
headed delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner
starting every now and then and muttering something to himself and
evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly
head with his thin neck exposed by his turn down collar toward the
the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power
in which most people see the chief interest of home politics denisov
dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
in the service heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg
which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on what
one used to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova and
madame kwudener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh they
should let that fine fellow bonaparte loose hed knock all this
nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment
to a fellow like that schwatz he cried
nicholas though free from denisovs readiness to find fault with
everything also thought that discussion of the government was a very
serious and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointed
minister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperor
had said so and so and this minister so and so seemed to him very
important and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these
things and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept the
conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
but natasha knowing all her husbands ways and ideas saw that he had
long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince
theodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince
always the same thing said pierre looking round at his listeners
everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be
allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to
what can decent men do nicholas inquired frowning slightly what
natasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby now
heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary
followed her the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski
followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
why this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the room
sometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position in
petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has
abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could not
tolerate mysticism in anyone now he seeks only for peace and only
these people sans foi ni loi  can give it him people who recklessly
hack at and strangle everything magnitski arakcheev and tutti
quanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estates
yourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was the
more readily your object might be attained he said to nicholas
well what does that lead up to said nicholas
well everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in the
army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the
people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young and
honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything is
strained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre as
those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
governments began i told them just one thing in petersburg
well you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under his
brows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and
philanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in the
at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face
darkened and he went up to the boy
why let him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and
continuing that is not enough i told them something else is needed
when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many as
possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
calamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and
depraved one is lured by women another by honors a third by ambition
or money and they go over to that camp no independent men such as you
or i are left what i say is widen the scope of our society let the
mot dordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well
nicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair sat
down in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowning
but action with what aim he cried and what position will you adopt
why the position of assistants the society need not be secret if the
government allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but it
is a society of true conservatives a society of gentlemen in the full
meaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from
killing my children and yours and arakcheev from sending me off to some
military settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and the
yes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one
why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then venture
to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is
an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christ
natasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at her
husband it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not
even interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she
knew that it sprang from pierres whole soul but it was his animated
the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn down collar
whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more
rapturous joy every word of pierres burned into his heart and with a
nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax
and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles table
it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german
no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters
but i dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it interposed
denisov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here is
wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont understand if were not
satisfied let us have a bunt of our own thats all wight je suis
pierre smiled natasha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his brows
still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any
great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his
imagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental faculties
were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this
made him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but
by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of his
i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously
twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally
abandoning the attempt i cant prove it to you you say that
everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont see
it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
matter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know but
if you formed a secret society and began working against the government
be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government and if
arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down i
should not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argue
an awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to speak
defending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weak
and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed and
no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remark
when they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski went
up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes
uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with
and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and
powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this
boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said he
regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to give
yes i think so he said reluctantly and left the study
the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he
had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas
uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to
all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table
and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned away
you ought not to have been here at all he said
the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies but
turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of 1812
denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing
about them the family separated on the most friendly terms
after supper nicholas having undressed in his study and given
instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the
bedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her
countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would
not be understood or approved by her husband
she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the same
time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to
a diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book
a diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the
december 4 today when andrusha her eldest boy woke up he did not wish
to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty and
obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took the
matter in hand i left him alone and began with nurses help to get the
other children up telling him that i did not love him for a long time
he was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me in
his shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time it
was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me
afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again began
crying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by
i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how
nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and
continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down
everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their
mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on
educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant
trifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now
that he read this diary about his children for the first time
mitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had
none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were
eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only
nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyes
gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary
there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or even
done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the
sole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had nicholas
been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady
tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reach
he was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own
insignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the
more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant look
and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you
werent in the study we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my
temper but he is impossible such a child i dont know what would
become of him if natasha didnt keep him in hand have you any idea
why he went to petersburg they have formed
yes i know said countess mary natasha told me
well then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mere
recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is
every honest mans duty to go against the government and that the oath
of allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they all fell on
me denisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she rules over him
and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own
but only repeats his sayings added nicholas yielding to that
irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natasha could
have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife
yes i have noticed that said countess mary
when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he
started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not there what
as i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre says
everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is
our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said
countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us
duties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might expose
ourselves to risks we must not risk our children
yes thats it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas who
fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view
love of ones neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of
young nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my things
ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas
said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid i
neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations while
he has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughts
well i dont think you need reproach yourself on his account all that
the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine lad this
evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancy as we were
going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to
bits and he told me of it himself at once i never knew him to tell an
untruth a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who at heart was
not fond of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that
still i am not the same as his own mother said countess mary i
feel i am not the same and it troubles me a wonderful boy but i am
dreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companions
well it wont be for long next summer ill take him to petersburg
said nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be he
continued returning to the talk in the study which had evidently
disturbed him well what business is it of mine what goes on there
whether arakcheev is bad and all that what business was it of mine
when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with
prison and had a mother who could not see or understand it and then
there are you and the children and our affairs is it for my own
pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night
no but i know i must work to comfort my mother to repay you and not
to leave the children such beggars as i was
countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
and that he attached too much importance to these matters but she knew
she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so she only
took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and a
confirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflection
you know mary today elias mitrofanych this was his overseer came
back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty
and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
repurchasing otradnoe before long and added another ten years of life
and i shall leave the children in an excellent position
countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told
her she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes
ask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she had
been thinking about something else but she had to force herself to
attend for what he was saying did not interest her at all she looked
at him and did not think but felt about something different she felt
a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all
that she understood and this seemed to make her love for him still
stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this
feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
the details of her husbands plans thoughts that had no connection with
what he was saying flitted through her mind she thought of her nephew
her husbands account of the boys agitation while pierre was speaking
struck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitive
character recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she
thought also of her own children she did not compare them with him but
compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt with
regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
difference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and
promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible in
this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and all
her neighbors as christ loved mankind countess marys soul always
strove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and could
therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secret
suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face nicholas
gazed at her o god what will become of us if she dies as i always
fear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself before
the icon he began to say his evening prayers
natasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and
wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity
understanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to
all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in
a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her
husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong
between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he
began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she
led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on
from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with wide
open happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom
saying now you are all mine mine you wont escape from that
moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and
contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at
one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did
not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest
just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and
contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this
intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were
not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them
natasha spoke to pierre about her brothers life and doings of how she
had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was
fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than
herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging marys
superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other
women and that now especially after having seen many women in
pierre answering natashas words told her how intolerable it had been
for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg
i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was
natasha looked intently at him and went on
mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as
if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was
how like his father he is pierre interjected
natasha knew why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas the
recollection of his dispute with his brother in law was unpleasant and
he wanted to know what natasha thought of it
nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line
said she repeating words pierre had once uttered
no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an
amusement almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is
collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till
he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and
montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began
to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show
so you say ideas are an amusement to him
yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i
saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is
ah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said
natasha which was most delighted lisa im sure
yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas
says we ought not to think but i cant help it besides when i was in
petersburg i felt i can say this to you that the whole affair would go
to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way but i succeeded
in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i
dont say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken
what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but
one banner that of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow and
natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres idea
but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to
society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express
this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer
than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those
whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one
he had respected so highly as platon karataev
do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon
karataev would he have approved of you now do you think
pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his
platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying
to imagine karataevs opinion on the subject he would not have
i love you awfully natasha suddenly said awfully awfully
no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what
he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious
to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i should
have been proud to let him see us there now you talk of my absence
but you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for you after a
no its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt love
more but this is something special yes of course  he did not
finish because their eyes meeting said the rest
what nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons
and that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is the
best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we
quarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what we
always about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealo
dont say it i cant bear it natasha cried and her eyes glittered
coldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pause
no and if i had i shouldnt have recognized her
oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at
you natasha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
come over them you are as like him as two peas like the boy she
meant her little son oh its time to go to him the milks
they were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one another
at the same time they both began to speak pierre began with self
satisfaction and enthusiasm natasha with a quiet happy smile having
interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue
no what did you say go on go on
no you go on i was talking nonsense said natasha
pierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to his complacent
reflections on his success in petersburg at that moment it seemed to
him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian
i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
simple ones my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
constitute a power then honest folk must do the same now thats simple
oh nothing only a trifle said natasha smilingly still more
brightly i only wanted to tell you about petya today nurse was coming
to take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung to me im
sure he thought he was hiding awfully sweet there now hes crying
well good by and she left the room
meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonskis bedroom a little lamp
was burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not
cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring little nicholas who had
just waked up in a cold perspiration sat up in bed and gazed before him
with wide open eyes he had awaked from a terrible dream he had dreamed
that he and uncle pierre wearing helmets such as were depicted in his
plutarch were leading a huge army the army was made up of white
slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in
autumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge in front was
glory which was similar to those threads but rather thicker he and
pierre were borne along lightly and joyously nearer and nearer to their
goal suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become
entangled and it grew difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood before
have you done this he said pointing to some broken sealing wax and
pens i loved you but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the
first of you who moves forward little nicholas turned to look at
pierre but pierre was no longer there in his place was his father
prince andrew and his father had neither shape nor form but he
existed and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love
he felt himself powerless limp and formless his father caressed and
pitied him but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them terror
my father he thought though there were two good portraits of prince
andrew in the house nicholas never imagined him in human form my
father has been with me and caressed me he approved of me and of uncle
pierre whatever he may tell me i will do it mucius scaevola burned
his hand why should not the same sort of thing happen to me i know
they want me to learn and i will learn but someday i shall have
finished learning and then i will do something i only pray god that
something may happen to me such as happened to plutarchs men and i
will act as they did i will do better everyone shall know me love me
and be delighted with me and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
are you ill he heard dessalles voice asking
no answered nicholas and lay back on his pillow
he is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles
but uncle pierre oh what a wonderful man he is and my father oh
father father yes i will do something with which even he would be
history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put into
words to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
and seize the apparently elusive the life of a people they described
the activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded the
activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation
the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by
what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients
met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of
a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
modern history in theory rejects both these principles
it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in mans
subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having
in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them
instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the
will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various
kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the
former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations
which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of
humanity modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the
french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the
welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually
meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a
modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has
obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine
authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same
conclusion by another road that is to recognize 1 nations guided by
individual men and 2 the existence of a known aim to which these
at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to
buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of
their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions
in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals
who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only
monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another
includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets
secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of
the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality
and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
in 1789 a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed
by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves
eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in
1812 it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable
symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it
as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the
counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the
during that twenty year period an immense number of fields were left
untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of
men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of
christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn
houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events
what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most
legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and
directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply
would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in
the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it
there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
period nor would there have been any contradictions
but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the
conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity
in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers
modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what
this movement means what caused it and what force produced these
louis xiv was a very proud and self confident man he had such and such
mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his
descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had
such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain
men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century
there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all
men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to
slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other
people at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon he
conquered everybody everywhere that is he killed many people because
he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and
killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having
become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria
and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was
an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and
therefore fought against napoleon in 1807 he suddenly made friends with
him but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many
people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured
moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor
alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to
arm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenly
became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to
abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the
title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before
and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand
then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears
before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then
the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who
managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby
extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these
conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the
diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of
again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon
arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating
him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were
angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated
the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him
to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved
france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and
bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction
occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their
it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the
historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the
contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the
historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of
separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked
if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
humanity and of the peoples the first question in the absence of a
reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is what is the
power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies
either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very
proud or that certain writers wrote certain books
all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not
what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
through napoleons louis es and writers but we do not acknowledge such
a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louis es and
authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men
if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be
explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of
history seems to assume that this force is self evident and known to
everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone
reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really
biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration
events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in
general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of
historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event
as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to
describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all
meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently
but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event
was produced by napoleons power another that it was produced by
alexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other person
besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in
their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleons
power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it
was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians
of this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy
the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no
writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force
which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in
heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously
directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a
general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of
one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the
according to this view the power of historical personages represented
as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded
as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal
historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an
historic character is first the product of his time and his power only
the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force
producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one
time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of
1789 and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleons
misdirected will and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
