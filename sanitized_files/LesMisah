worn out exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further this
incident attracted a crowd hardly had the cursing and indignant carter
had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word matin the
jade backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip when the jade fell
never to rise again on hearing the hubbub made by the passersby
tholomyes merry auditors turned their heads and tholomyes took
advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with
elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses 3
et rosse elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses
there is fantine on the point of crying over horses how can one be
at that moment favourite folding her arms and throwing her head back
exactly the moment has arrived replied tholomyes gentlemen
the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck wait for us a
each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistresss brow then all four filed
out through the door with their fingers on their lips
it is beginning to be amusing already said she
dont be too long murmured fantine we are waiting for you
when the young girls were left alone they leaned two by two on the
window sills chatting craning out their heads and talking from one
they saw the young men emerge from the cafe bombarda arm in arm the
latter turned round made signs to them smiled and disappeared in
that dusty sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the
what are they going to bring us said zephine
it will certainly be something pretty said dahlia
for my part said favourite i want it to be of gold
their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the
lake which they could see through the branches of the large trees and
it was the hour for the departure of the mail coaches and diligences
nearly all the stage coaches for the south and west passed through the
champs elysees the majority followed the quay and went through the
passy barrier from moment to moment some huge vehicle painted yellow
and black heavily loaded noisily harnessed rendered shapeless
by trunks tarpaulins and valises full of heads which immediately
disappeared rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge
with dust for smoke and an air of fury grinding the pavements
changing all the paving stones into steels this uproar delighted the
what a row one would say that it was a pile of chains flying away
it chanced that one of these vehicles which they could only see with
difficulty through the thick elms halted for a moment then set out
thats odd said she i thought the diligence never stopped
this fantine is surprising i am coming to take a look at her out of
curiosity she is dazzled by the simplest things suppose a case i am
a traveller i say to the diligence i will go on in advance you shall
pick me up on the quay as you pass the diligence passes sees me
halts and takes me that is done every day you do not know life my
in this manner a certain time elapsed all at once favourite made a
movement like a person who is just waking up
yes by the way joined in dahlia the famous surprise
they are a very long time about it said fantine
as fantine concluded this sigh the waiter who had served them at dinner
entered he held in his hand something which resembled a letter
it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies
why did you not bring it at once
because said the waiter the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it
favourite snatched the paper from the waiters hand it was in fact a
stop said she there is no address but this is what is written on
she tore the letter open hastily opened it and read she knew how to
you must know that we have parents parents you do not know much about
such things they are called fathers and mothers by the civil code
which is puerile and honest now these parents groan these old folks
implore us these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons
they desire our return and offer to kill calves for us being virtuous
we obey them at the hour when you read this five fiery horses will
be bearing us to our papas and mammas we are pulling up our stakes as
bossuet says we are going we are gone we flee in the arms of lafitte
and on the wings of caillard the toulouse diligence tears us from
the abyss and the abyss is you o our little beauties we return to
society to duty to respectability at full trot at the rate of three
leagues an hour it is necessary for the good of the country that we
should be like the rest of the world prefects fathers of families
rural police and councillors of state venerate us we are sacrificing
ourselves mourn for us in haste and replace us with speed if this
letter lacerates you do the same by it adieu
for the space of nearly two years we have made you happy we bear you
the four young women looked at each other
favourite was the first to break the silence
well she exclaimed its a very pretty farce all the same
that must have been blachevelles idea resumed favourite it makes
me in love with him no sooner is he gone than he is loved this is an
no said dahlia it was one of tholomyes ideas that is evident
in that case retorted favourite death to blachevelle and long live
an hour later when she had returned to her room she wept it was
her first love affair as we have said she had given herself to this
tholomyes as to a husband and the poor girl had a child
book fourth to confide is sometimes to deliver into a persons power
there was at montfermeil near paris during the first quarter of this
century a sort of cook shop which no longer exists this cook shop was
kept by some people named thenardier husband and wife it was situated
in boulanger lane over the door there was a board nailed flat against
the wall upon this board was painted something which resembled a
man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilt
epaulettes of a general with large silver stars red spots represented
blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably
represented a battle below ran this inscription at the sign of
nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry
nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of
a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the cook shop of the
sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of 1818 would certainly
have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed
it was the fore carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded
tracts of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the
trunks of trees this fore carriage was composed of a massive iron
axle tree with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and
which was supported by two huge wheels the whole thing was compact
overwhelming and misshapen it seemed like the gun carriage of an
enormous cannon the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the
fellies the hub the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous
yellowish daubing hue tolerably like that with which people are fond
of ornamenting cathedrals the wood was disappearing under mud and the
iron beneath rust under the axle tree hung like drapery a huge chain
worthy of some goliath of a convict this chain suggested not the
beams which it was its office to transport but the mastodons and
mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the
galleys but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys and it seemed to have
been detached from some monster homer would have bound polyphemus with
why was that fore carriage of a truck in that place in the street in
the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might
finish the process of rusting there is a throng of institutions in the
old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks
about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the
the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in
the loop as in the rope of a swing there were seated and grouped on
that particular evening in exquisite interlacement two little girls
one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the
younger in the arms of the other a handkerchief cleverly knotted about
them prevented their falling out a mother had caught sight of that
frightful chain and had said come theres a plaything for my
the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were
radiant with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid
old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of
laughter one had chestnut hair the other brown their innocent faces
were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted
to the passers by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child
of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the
chaste indecency of childhood above and around these two delicate
heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic
fore carriage black with rust almost terrible all entangled in curves
and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern a few
paces apart crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry the
mother not a very prepossessing woman by the way though touching
at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long cord
watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and
celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity at every backward
and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound which
resembled a cry of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting
sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this
caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of
as she rocked her little ones the mother hummed in a discordant voice a
her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing
and seeing what was going on in the street
in the meantime some one had approached her as she was beginning the
first couplet of the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very
replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head
a woman stood before her a few paces distant this woman also had a
she was carrying in addition a large carpet bag which seemed very
this womans child was one of the most divine creatures that it is
possible to behold it was a girl two or three years of age she could
have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as
the coquetry of her dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen
ribbons on her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap the folds of
her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white firm and
dimpled leg she was admirably rosy and healthy the little beauty
inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks of her
eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and
that they had magnificent lashes she was asleep
she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her
age the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep
as for the mother her appearance was sad and poverty stricken she
was dressed like a working woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant
again she was young was she handsome perhaps but in that attire it
was not apparent her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed
very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close
nun like cap tied under the chin a smile displays beautiful teeth when
one has them but she did not smile her eyes did not seem to have been
dry for a very long time she was pale she had a very weary and rather
sickly appearance she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with
the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child a large blue
handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fichu and
concealed her figure clumsily her hands were sunburnt and all dotted
with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the
needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff a linen gown
it was fantine but difficult to recognize nevertheless on
scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained
her beauty a melancholy fold which resembled the beginning of irony
wrinkled her right cheek as for her toilette that aerial toilette of
muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music
full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful
and dazzling hoar frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight
it melts and leaves the branch quite black
ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce
what had taken place during those ten months it can be divined
lost sight of favourite zephine and dahlia the bond once broken on the
side of the men it was loosed between the women they would have been
greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later that they
had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing
fantine had remained alone the father of her child gone alas such
ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus
the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure drawn away by her
liaison with tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew she
had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to her she had
no resource fantine barely knew how to read and did not know how to
write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name
she had a public letter writer indite an epistle to tholomyes then a
second then a third tholomyes replied to none of them fantine heard
the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children
seriously one only shrugs ones shoulders over such children then she
thought of tholomyes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child
and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew
gloomy toward that man but what was she to do she no longer knew to
whom to apply she had committed a fault but the foundation of her
nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue she was vaguely
conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of
gliding into a worse state courage was necessary she possessed it and
held herself firm the idea of returning to her native town of m sur
m occurred to her there some one might possibly know her and give her
work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault in a confused
way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more
painful than the first one her heart contracted but she took her
resolution fantine as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life
she had already valiantly renounced finery had dressed herself in
linen and had put all her silks all her ornaments all her ribbons
and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to
her and a holy one it was she sold all that she had which produced
for her two hundred francs her little debts paid she had only about
eighty francs left at the age of twenty two on a beautiful spring
morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back any one who
had seen these two pass would have had pity on them this woman had
in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the
world no one but this woman fantine had nursed her child and this had
tired her chest and she coughed a little
we shall have no further occasion to speak of m felix tholomyes let us
confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis
philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influential a
wise elector and a very severe juryman he was still a man of pleasure
towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the
sake of resting herself travelled for three or four sous a league in
what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris the
little suburban coach service fantine found herself at montfermeil
as she passed the thenardier hostelry the two little girls blissful
in the monster swing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in
charms exist these two little girls were a charm to this mother
she gazed at them in much emotion the presence of angels is an
announcement of paradise she thought that above this inn she beheld
the mysterious here of providence these two little creatures were
evidently happy she gazed at them she admired them in such emotion
that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between
two couplets of her song she could not refrain from addressing to her
the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their
the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer
sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the
my name is madame thenardier said the mother of the two little girls
then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between
it must be so i am a knight
this madame thenardier was a sandy complexioned woman thin and
angular the type of the soldiers wife in all its unpleasantness and
what was odd with a languishing air which she owed to her perusal
of romances she was a simpering but masculine creature old romances
produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook shop
woman she was still young she was barely thirty if this crouching
woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a
perambulating colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the
traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what
caused what we have to relate to vanish a person who is seated instead
of standing erect destinies hang upon such a thing as that
the traveller told her story with slight modifications
that she was a working woman that her husband was dead that her
work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it
elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning
on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had
got into the villemomble coach when she met it that from villemomble
she had come to montfermeil on foot that the little one had walked a
little but not much because she was so young and that she had been
obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep
at this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke
her the child opened her eyes great blue eyes like her mothers and
looked at what nothing with that serious and sometimes severe air of
little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in
the presence of our twilight of virtue one would say that they feel
themselves to be angels and that they know us to be men then the child
began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to
the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished
to run all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing
stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration
mother thenardier released her daughters made them descend from the
children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration
of a minute the little thenardiers were playing with the new comer at
making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure
the new comer was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the
gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her
for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly the
grave diggers business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by
for cosette read euphrasie the childs name was euphrasie but out
of euphrasie the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful
instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into
pepita and francoise into sillette it is a sort of derivative which
disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists we have
known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into gnon
in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of
profound anxiety and blissfulness an event had happened a big worm
had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in
their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there
how easily children get acquainted at once exclaimed mother
thenardier one would swear that they were three sisters
this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been
waiting for she seized the thenardiers hand looked at her fixedly
the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify
you see i cannot take my daughter to the country my work will not
permit it with a child one can find no situation people are ridiculous
in the country it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn when
i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy
it overwhelmed me i said here is a good mother that is just the
thing that will make three sisters and then it will not be long
before i return will you keep my child for me
i must see about it replied the thenardier
i will give you six francs a month
here a mans voice called from the depths of the cook shop
not for less than seven francs and six months paid in advance
six times seven makes forty two said the thenardier
and fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses added the
total fifty seven francs said madame thenardier and she hummed
i will pay it said the mother i have eighty francs i shall have
enough left to reach the country by travelling on foot i shall
earn money there and as soon as i have a little i will return for my
of course she has an outfit the poor treasure i understood perfectly
that it was your husband and a beautiful outfit too a senseless
outfit everything by the dozen and silk gowns like a lady it is here
you must hand it over struck in the mans voice again
of course i shall give it to you said the mother it would be very
queer if i were to leave my daughter quite naked
the bargain was concluded the mother passed the night at the inn gave
up her money and left her child fastened her carpet bag once more now
reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit and light henceforth
and set out on the following morning intending to return soon people
arrange such departures tranquilly but they are despairs
a neighbor of the thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out
i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to
when cosettes mother had taken her departure the man said to the
that will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which
falls due to morrow i lacked fifty francs do you know that i should
have had a bailiff and a protest after me you played the mouse trap
chapter ii first sketch of two unprepossessing figures
the mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen but the cat
let us say a word or two of them now we will complete the sketch later
these beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people
who have been successful and of intelligent people who have descended
in the scale which is between the class called middle and the class
denominated as inferior and which combines some of the defects of the
second with nearly all the vices of the first without possessing
the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the
they were of those dwarfed natures which if a dull fire chances to warm
them up easily become monstrous there was in the woman a substratum
of the brute and in the man the material for a blackguard both were
susceptible in the highest degree of the sort of hideous progress
which is accomplished in the direction of evil there exist crab like
souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness
retrograding in life rather than advancing employing experience to
augment their deformity growing incessantly worse and becoming more
and more impregnated with an ever augmenting blackness this man and
thenardier in particular was troublesome for a physiognomist one can
only look at some men to distrust them for one feels that they are
dark in both directions they are uneasy in the rear and threatening
in front there is something of the unknown about them one can no more
answer for what they have done than for what they will do the shadow
which they bear in their glance denounces them from merely hearing them
utter a word or seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of
sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future
this thenardier if he himself was to be believed had been a soldier a
sergeant he said he had probably been through the campaign of 1815
and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem we
shall see later on how much truth there was in this the sign of his
hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms he had painted it
himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly
it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after
having been clelie was no longer anything but lodoiska still noble
but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de
scuderi to madame bournon malarme and from madame de lafayette to
madame barthelemy hadot was setting the loving hearts of the portresses
of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent madame
thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books she
lived on them in them she drowned what brains she possessed this had
given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive
attitude towards her husband a scamp of a certain depth a ruffian
lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and fine at one and the
same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the
perusal of pigault lebrun and in what concerns the sex as he said
in his jargon a downright unmitigated lout his wife was twelve or
fifteen years younger than he was later on when her hair arranged in
a romantically drooping fashion began to grow gray when the magaera
began to be developed from the pamela the female thenardier was nothing
but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances now
one cannot read nonsense with impunity the result was that her eldest
daughter was named eponine as for the younger the poor little thing
came near being called gulnare i know not to what diversion effected
by a romance of ducray dumenil she owed the fact that she merely bore
however we will remark by the way everything was not ridiculous and
superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding and which
may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names by the side of
this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social
symptom it is not rare for the neatherds boy nowadays to bear the name
of arthur alfred or alphonse and for the vicomte if there are
still any vicomtes to be called thomas pierre or jacques this
displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the
rustic name on the aristocrat is nothing else than an eddy of equality
the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as
everywhere else beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a
it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper the
thanks to the travellers fifty seven francs thenardier had been able
to avoid a protest and to honor his signature on the following month
they were again in need of money the woman took cosettes outfit to
paris and pawned it at the pawnbrokers for sixty francs as soon
as that sum was spent the thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the
little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity
and they treated her accordingly as she had no longer any clothes they
dressed her in the cast off petticoats and chemises of the thenardier
brats that is to say in rags they fed her on what all the rest
had left a little better than the dog a little worse than the cat
moreover the cat and the dog were her habitual table companions
cosette ate with them under the table from a wooden bowl similar to
the mother who had established herself as we shall see later on at m
sur m wrote or more correctly caused to be written a letter every
month that she might have news of her child the thenardiers replied
at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs
for the seventh month and continued her remittances with tolerable
regularity from month to month the year was not completed when
thenardier said a fine favor she is doing us in sooth what does she
expect us to do with her seven francs and he wrote to demand twelve
francs the mother whom they had persuaded into the belief that her
child was happy and was coming on well submitted and forwarded the
certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other
mother thenardier loved her two daughters passionately which caused her
it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous
aspects little as was the space occupied by cosette it seemed to
her as though it were taken from her own and that that little child
diminished the air which her daughters breathed this woman like many
women of her sort had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and
injuries to dispense each day if she had not had cosette it is certain
that her daughters idolized as they were would have received the whole
of it but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to
herself her daughters received nothing but caresses cosette could not
make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of
violent blows and unmerited chastisement the sweet feeble being who
should not have understood anything of this world or of god incessantly
punished scolded ill used beaten and seeing beside her two little
creatures like herself who lived in a ray of dawn
madame thenardier was vicious with cosette eponine and azelma were
vicious children at that age are only copies of their mother the size
those thenardiers are good people they are not rich and yet they are
bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands
they thought that cosettes mother had forgotten her
in the meanwhile thenardier having learned it is impossible to say by
what obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the
mother could not acknowledge it exacted fifteen francs a month saying
that the creature was growing and eating and threatening to send
her away let her not bother me he exclaimed or ill fire her brat
right into the middle of her secrets i must have an increase the
from year to year the child grew and so did her wretchedness
as long as cosette was little she was the scape goat of the two other
children as soon as she began to develop a little that is to say
before she was even five years old she became the servant of the
five years old the reader will say that is not probable alas it is
true social suffering begins at all ages have we not recently seen the
trial of a man named dumollard an orphan turned bandit who from the
age of five as the official documents state being alone in the world
cosette was made to run on errands to sweep the rooms the courtyard
the street to wash the dishes to even carry burdens the thenardiers
considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner
since the mother who was still at m sur m had become irregular in
her payments some months she was in arrears
if this mother had returned to montfermeil at the end of these three
years she would not have recognized her child cosette so pretty and
rosy on her arrival in that house was now thin and pale she had an
indescribably uneasy look the sly creature said the thenardiers
injustice had made her peevish and misery had made her ugly nothing
remained to her except her beautiful eyes which inspired pain because
large as they were it seemed as though one beheld in them a still
it was a heart breaking thing to see this poor child not yet six years
old shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen full of holes
sweeping the street before daylight with an enormous broom in her tiny
red hands and a tear in her great eyes
she was called the lark in the neighborhood the populace who are fond
of these figures of speech had taken a fancy to bestow this name on
this trembling frightened and shivering little creature no bigger
than a bird who was awake every morning before any one else in the
house or the village and was always in the street or the fields before
chapter i the history of a progress in black glass trinkets
and in the meantime what had become of that mother who according to
the people at montfermeil seemed to have abandoned her child where was
after leaving her little cosette with the thenardiers she had continued
her journey and had reached m sur m
this it will be remembered was in 1818
fantine had quitted her province ten years before m sur m had changed
its aspect while fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness
about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the
grand events of small districts had taken place
this detail is important and we regard it as useful to develop it at
length we should almost say to underline it
from time immemorial m sur m had had for its special industry the
imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany this
industry had always vegetated on account of the high price of the raw
material which reacted on the manufacture at the moment when fantine
returned to m sur m an unheard of transformation had taken place
in the production of black goods towards the close of 1815 a man
a stranger had established himself in the town and had been inspired
with the idea of substituting in this manufacture gum lac for resin
and for bracelets in particular slides of sheet iron simply laid
this very small change had effected a revolution
this very small change had in fact prodigiously reduced the cost of
the raw material which had rendered it possible in the first place to
raise the price of manufacture a benefit to the country in the second
place to improve the workmanship an advantage to the consumer in the
third place to sell at a lower price while trebling the profit which
in less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich
which is good and had made every one about him rich which is better
he was a stranger in the department of his origin nothing was known
of the beginning of his career very little it was rumored that he had
come to town with very little money a few hundred francs at the most
it was from this slender capital enlisted in the service of an
ingenious idea developed by method and thought that he had drawn his
own fortune and the fortune of the whole countryside
on his arrival at m sur m he had only the garments the appearance
it appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into
the little town of m sur m just at nightfall on a december evening
knapsack on back and thorn club in hand a large fire had broken out
in the town hall this man had rushed into the flames and saved at the
risk of his own life two children who belonged to the captain of the
gendarmerie this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport
afterwards they had learned his name he was called father madeleine
he was a man about fifty years of age who had a preoccupied air and
who was good that was all that could be said about him
thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably
re constructed m sur m had become a rather important centre of trade
spain which consumes a good deal of black jet made enormous purchases
there each year m sur m almost rivalled london and berlin in this
branch of commerce father madeleines profits were such that at the
end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory in which
there were two vast workrooms one for the men and the other for women
any one who was hungry could present himself there and was sure of
finding employment and bread father madeleine required of the men good
will of the women pure morals and of all probity he had separated
the work rooms in order to separate the sexes and so that the women and
girls might remain discreet on this point he was inflexible it was the
only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant he was all the more
firmly set on this severity since m sur m being a garrison town
opportunities for corruption abounded however his coming had been a
boon and his presence was a godsend before father madeleines arrival
everything had languished in the country now everything lived with
a healthy life of toil a strong circulation warmed everything and
penetrated everywhere slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown
there was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it no
dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it
father madeleine gave employment to every one he exacted but one thing
be an honest man be an honest woman
as we have said in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause
and the pivot father madeleine made his fortune but a singular thing
in a simple man of business it did not seem as though that were his
chief care he appeared to be thinking much of others and little of
himself in 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty
thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte but before reserving
these six hundred and thirty thousand francs he had spent more than a
the hospital was badly endowed he founded six beds there m sur m is
divided into the upper and the lower town the lower town in which he
lived had but one school a miserable hovel which was falling to ruin
he constructed two one for girls the other for boys he allotted a
salary from his own funds to the two instructors a salary twice as
large as their meagre official salary and one day he said to some one
who expressed surprise the two prime functionaries of the state are
the nurse and the schoolmaster he created at his own expense an infant
school a thing then almost unknown in france and a fund for aiding old
and infirm workmen as his factory was a centre a new quarter in which
there were a good many indigent families rose rapidly around him he
at first when they watched his beginnings the good souls said hes
a jolly fellow who means to get rich when they saw him enriching
the country before he enriched himself the good souls said he is
an ambitious man this seemed all the more probable since the man was
religious and even practised his religion to a certain degree a thing
which was very favorably viewed at that epoch he went regularly to
low mass every sunday the local deputy who nosed out all rivalry
everywhere soon began to grow uneasy over this religion this deputy
had been a member of the legislative body of the empire and shared the
religious ideas of a father of the oratoire known under the name
of fouche duc dotrante whose creature and friend he had been he
indulged in gentle raillery at god with closed doors but when he beheld
the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going to low mass at seven oclock
he perceived in him a possible candidate and resolved to outdo him he
took a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers ambition
was at that time in the direct acceptation of the word a race to the
steeple the poor profited by this terror as well as the good god for
the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital which made
nevertheless in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town
to the effect that on the representations of the prefect and in
consideration of the services rendered by him to the country father
madeleine was to be appointed by the king mayor of m sur m those who
had pronounced this new comer to be an ambitious fellow seized with
delight on this opportunity which all men desire to exclaim there
what did we say all m sur m was in an uproar the rumor was well
founded several days later the appointment appeared in the moniteur on
in this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by
madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition when the jury made their
report the king appointed the inventor a chevalier of the legion of
honor a fresh excitement in the little town well so it was the cross
that he wanted father madeleine refused the cross
decidedly this man was an enigma the good souls got out of their
predicament by saying after all he is some sort of an adventurer
we have seen that the country owed much to him the poor owed him
everything he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been
obliged to honor and respect him his workmen in particular adored
him and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity
when he was known to be rich people in society bowed to him and
he received invitations in the town he was called in town monsieur
madeleine his workmen and the children continued to call him father
madeleine and that was what was most adapted to make him smile in
proportion as he mounted throve invitations rained down upon him
society claimed him for its own the prim little drawing rooms on
m sur m which of course had at first been closed to the artisan
opened both leaves of their folding doors to the millionnaire they made
this time the good gossips had no trouble he is an ignorant man of
no education no one knows where he came from he would not know how to
behave in society it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how
when they saw him making money they said he is a man of business
when they saw him scattering his money about they said he is an
ambitious man when he was seen to decline honors they said he is
an adventurer when they saw him repulse society they said he is a
in 1820 five years after his arrival in m sur m the services which
he had rendered to the district were so dazzling the opinion of
the whole country round about was so unanimous that the king again
appointed him mayor of the town he again declined but the prefect
resisted his refusal all the notabilities of the place came to implore
him the people in the street besought him the urging was so vigorous
that he ended by accepting it was noticed that the thing which seemed
chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe
