effected a wholesale loan from an armorers shop
nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this
troop one had a round jacket a cavalry sabre and two holster pistols
another was in his shirt sleeves with a round hat and a powder horn
slung at his side a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper
and was armed with a saddlers awl there was one who was shouting
let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our
bayonet this man had no bayonet another spread out over his coat the
cross belt and cartridge box of a national guardsman the cover of the
cartridge box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted
public order there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the
legions few hats no cravats many bare arms some pikes add to
this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed
longshoremen all were in haste and as they helped each other they
discussed the possible chances that they would receive succor about
three oclock in the morning that they were sure of one regiment that
paris would rise terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of
cordial joviality one would have pronounced them brothers but they did
not know each others names great perils have this fine characteristic
that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers a fire had been
lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into
bullets pewter mugs spoons forks and all the brass table ware of
the establishment in the midst of it all they drank caps and
buckshot were mixed pell mell on the tables with glasses of wine in
the billiard hall mame hucheloup matelote and gibelotte variously
modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another
breathless and roused the third were tearing up old dish cloths and
making lint three insurgents were assisting them three bushy haired
jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen
with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble
the man of lofty stature whom courfeyrac combeferre and enjolras had
observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the
rue des billettes was at work on the smaller barricade and was making
himself useful there gavroche was working on the larger one as for the
young man who had been waiting for courfeyrac at his lodgings and who
had inquired for m marius he had disappeared at about the time when
gavroche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get
everything in readiness he went came mounted descended re mounted
whistled and sparkled he seemed to be there for the encouragement of
all had he any incentive yes certainly his poverty had he wings
yes certainly his joy gavroche was a whirlwind he was constantly
visible he was incessantly audible he filled the air as he was
everywhere at once he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no halt
was possible with him the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches
he troubled the loungers he excited the idle he reanimated the weary
he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety in some
and breath in others wrath in others movement in all now pricking
a student now biting an artisan he alighted paused flew off again
hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to
another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on
perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his
courage more paving stones more casks more machines where are you
now a hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with your barricade
is very small it must be carried up put everything on it fling
everything there stick it all in break down the house a barricade is
mother gibous tea hullo heres a glass door
a glass door what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle
hercules yourselves retorted gavroche a glass door is an excellent
thing in a barricade it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the
enemy taking it so youve never prigged apples over a wall where there
were broken bottles a glass door cuts the corns of the national guard
when they try to mount on the barricade pardi glass is a treacherous
thing well you havent a very wildly lively imagination comrades
however he was furious over his triggerless pistol he went from one to
another demanding a gun i want a gun why dont you give me a gun
come now said gavroche why not i had one in 1830 when we had a
when there are enough for the men we will give some to the children
if you are killed before me i shall take yours
a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street
come with us young fellow well now dont we do anything for this old
the journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable
structure of the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie as they call
it reached to the level of the first floor were mistaken the fact is
that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet it was
built in such a manner that the combatants could at their will either
disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by
means of a quadruple row of paving stones placed on top of each other
and arranged as steps in the interior on the outside the front of the
barricade composed of piles of paving stones and casks bound together
by beams and planks which were entangled in the wheels of anceaus dray
and of the overturned omnibus had a bristling and inextricable aspect
an aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made
between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which
was furthest from the wine shop so that an exit was possible at this
point the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with
ropes and a red flag fastened to this pole floated over the
the little mondetour barricade hidden behind the wine shop building
was not visible the two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt
enjolras and courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other
fragment of the rue mondetour which opens through the rue des precheurs
an issue into the halles wishing no doubt to preserve a possible
communication with the outside and not entertaining much fear of
an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the rue des
with the exception of this issue which was left free and which
constituted what folard in his strategical style would have termed a
branch and taking into account also the narrow cutting arranged on the
rue de la chanvrerie the interior of the barricade where the wine shop
formed a salient angle presented an irregular square closed on all
sides there existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand
barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street
so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses all
all this work was performed without any hindrance in less than an hour
and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear skin cap or
a single bayonet make their appearance the very bourgeois who still
ventured at this hour of riot to enter the rue saint denis cast a
glance at the rue de la chanvrerie caught sight of the barricade and
the two barricades being finished and the flag run up a table was
dragged out of the wine shop and courfeyrac mounted on the table
enjolras brought the square coffer and courfeyrac opened it this
coffer was filled with cartridges when the mob saw the cartridges a
tremor ran through the bravest and a momentary silence ensued
each one received thirty cartridges many had powder and set about
making others with the bullets which they had run as for the barrel of
powder it stood on a table on one side near the door and was held in
the alarm beat which ran through all paris did not cease but it had
finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no
longer paid any attention this noise retreated at times and again drew
they loaded the guns and carbines all together without haste with
solemn gravity enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the
barricades one in the rue de la chanvrerie the second in the rue des
precheurs the third at the corner of the rue de la petite truanderie
then the barricades having been built the posts assigned the guns
loaded the sentinels stationed they waited alone in those redoubtable
streets through which no one passed any longer surrounded by those
dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated
enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on
in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt
advancing and which had about it something tragic and terrifying
during those hours of waiting what did they do
we must needs tell since this is a matter of history
while the men made bullets and the women lint while a large saucepan
of melted brass and lead destined to the bullet mould smoked over a
glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the
barricade while enjolras whom it was impossible to divert kept an
eye on the sentinels combeferre courfeyrac jean prouvaire feuilly
bossuet joly bahorel and some others sought each other out and
united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their
student life and in one corner of this wine shop which had been
converted into a casement a couple of paces distant from the redoubt
which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting
against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to
a supreme hour began to recite love verses
et que nous navions au coeur dautre envie
nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans
et que dans notre humble et petit menage
vous etiez jolie au point que les roses
comme elle sent bon quels cheveux a flots
le doux mois davril au beau mois de mai
tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine
je voyais un astre au fond du grenier
jai fort lu platon mais rien ne men reste
mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir
de rubans de fleurs de gaze et de moire
je prenais le bol de terre de pipe
et je te donnais le tasse en japon
et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire
je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds
je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu
je restai tout pale et je crus en dieu
oh que de soupirs de nos coeurs pleins dombre
the hour the spot these souvenirs of youth recalled a few stars
which began to twinkle in the sky the funeral repose of those deserted
streets the imminence of the inexorable adventure which was in
preparation gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low
tone in the dusk by jean prouvaire who as we have said was a gentle
in the meantime a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade and in
the large one one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on
shrove tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way
to la courtille these torches as the reader has seen came from the
the torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving stones closed on
three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion
that all the light fell on the flag the street and the barricade
remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag
formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark lantern
this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and
chapter vii the man recruited in the rue des billettes
night was fully come nothing made its appearance all that they heard
was confused noises and at intervals fusillades but these were rare
badly sustained and distant this respite which was thus prolonged
was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its
forces these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand
enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls
on the threshold of redoubtable events he went in search of gavroche
who had set to making cartridges in the tap room by the dubious light
of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of
the powder which was scattered on the tables these two candles cast no
gleam outside the insurgents had moreover taken pains not to have any
gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with
his cartridges the man of the rue des billettes had just entered
the tap room and had seated himself at the table which was the least
lighted a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it
between his legs gavroche who had been up to that moment distracted
by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man
when he entered gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes
admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street
urchin sprang to his feet any one who had spied upon that man up to
that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the
barricade and in the band of insurgents with singular attention but
from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort
of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on
the gamin approached this pensive personage and began to step around
him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is
afraid of waking at the same time over his childish countenance which
was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so
gay and so heart breaking passed all those grimaces of an old man which
signify ah bah impossible my sight is bad i am dreaming can this
be no it is not but yes why no etc gavroche balanced on his
heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a
bird expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip he
was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled he had the
mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering a
venus among the blowsy females and the air of an amateur recognizing
a raphael in a heap of daubs his whole being was at work the instinct
which scents out and the intelligence which combines it was evident
that a great event had happened in gavroches life
it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that enjolras
you are small said enjolras you will not be seen go out of the
barricade slip along close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the
streets and come back and tell me what is going on
so the little chaps are good for something thats very lucky ill
go in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big
ones and gavroche raising his head and lowering his voice added
as he indicated the man of the rue des billettes do you see that big
it isnt two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port
royal where i was taking the air by my ear
enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very
low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand
the man left the room and returned almost immediately accompanied by
three others the four men four porters with broad shoulders went
and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention
behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning
with his elbows they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him
then enjolras approached the man and demanded of him
at this abrupt query the man started he plunged his gaze deep into
enjolras clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latters meaning he
smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic
and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty
enjolras made a sign to the four men in the twinkling of an eye before
javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pinioned
they found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of
glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with
this motto supervision and vigilance and on the other this note
javert inspector of police aged fifty two and the signature of the
prefect of police of that day m gisquet
besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several
gold pieces they left him his purse and his watch under the watch
at the bottom of his fob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope
which enjolras unfolded and on which he read these five lines written
in the very hand of the prefect of police
as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert
will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the
malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine
the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind
his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the
room which had formerly given the wine shop its name
gavroche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved
of everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and
its the mouse who has caught the cat
all this was so rapidly executed that it was all over when those about
at the sight of javert bound to the post courfeyrac bossuet joly
combeferre and the men scattered over the two barricades came running
javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he
could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of
and turning to javert you will be shot ten minutes before the
then finish the business with a blow from a knife
spy said the handsome enjolras we are judges and not assassins
here you go about your business do what i told you
and halting as he was on the point of setting out
by the way you will give me his gun and he added i leave you the
the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening
chapter viii many interrogation points with regard to a certain le
cabuc whose name may not have been le cabuc
the tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete the
reader would not see those grand moments of social birth pangs in a
revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort
in their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here
outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred
mobs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they
roll along a throng of tumultuous men these men do not ask each other
whence they come among the passers by who had joined the rabble led by
enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac there had been a person wearing
the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the
shoulders who gesticulated and vociferated and who had the look of a
drunken savage this man whose name or nickname was le cabuc and who
was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him
was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so and had seated
himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside
of the wine shop this cabuc while making those who vied with him drunk
seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the
extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole
street and faced the rue saint denis all at once he exclaimed
do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire
when we are at the windows the deuce is in it if any one can advance
yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers
le cabuc runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks
the door opens not he strikes a second blow no one answers a third
then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end
it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of
oak lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays a genuine
prison postern the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house
nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a
tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at
this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray haired
old man who was the porter and who held a candle
gentlemen said the porter what do you want
le cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and
as it was very dark the porter did not see him
the porter did not finish the shot was fired the ball entered under
his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the
the old man fell back without a sigh the candle fell and was
extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head
lying on the sill of the small window and a little whitish smoke which
there said le cabuc dropping the butt end of his gun to the
he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his
shoulder with the weight of an eagles talon and he heard a voice
the murderer turned round and saw before him enjolras cold white face
he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge
he had seized cabucs collar blouse shirt and suspender with his left
and with an imperious motion the frail young man of twenty years bent
the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees
le cabuc attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a
enjolras pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his womans
face had about him at that moment something of the antique themis
his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes gave to his implacable greek
profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which
as the ancient world viewed the matter befit justice
the whole barricade hastened up then all ranged themselves in a circle
at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the
presence of the thing which they were about to behold
le cabuc vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every
enjolras released him and drew out his watch
collect yourself said he think or pray you have one minute
mercy murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a
enjolras never took his eyes off of him he allowed a minute to pass
then he replaced his watch in his fob that done he grasped le cabuc
by the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and
shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear many of those
intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of
an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement face
enjolras straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance
around him then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said
three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still
agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled
and flung it over the little barricade into the rue mondetour
enjolras was thoughtful it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows
slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity all at once he raised his
citizens said enjolras what that man did is frightful what i have
done is horrible he killed therefore i killed him i had to do it
because insurrection must have its discipline assassination is even
more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the
revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of
duty and must not be possible to slander our combat i have therefore
tried that man and condemned him to death as for myself constrained
as i am to do what i have done and yet abhorring it i have judged
myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself
so be it replied enjolras one word more in executing this man
i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world
necessitys name is fatality now the law of progress is that monsters
shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall vanish before
fraternity it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love no matter i
do pronounce it and i glorify it love the future is thine death i
make use of thee but i hate thee citizens in the future there will
be neither darkness nor thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance nor
bloody retaliation as there will be no more satan there will be no
more michael in the future no one will kill any one else the earth
will beam with radiance the human race will love the day will come
citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and life it
will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to
enjolras ceased his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time
standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility his
staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones
jean prouvaire and combeferre pressed each others hands silently and
leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched
with an admiration in which there was some compassion that grave young
man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also
let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were
taken to the morgue and searched a police agents card was found on le
cabuc the author of this book had in his hands in 1848 the special
report on this subject made to the prefect of police in 1832
we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which
is strange but probably well founded le cabuc was claquesous the fact
is that dating from the death of le cabuc there was no longer any
question of claquesous claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his
disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the
invisible his life had been all shadows his end was night
the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion
of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly
terminated when courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade the small
young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius
this lad who had a bold and reckless air had come by night to join the
chapter i from the rue plumet to the quartier saint denis
the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the
barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie had produced on him the effect
of the voice of destiny he wished to die the opportunity presented
itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness
offered him the key these melancholy openings which take place in the
gloom before despair are tempting marius thrust aside the bar which
had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said i
mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his
brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those
two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at
once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to
he set out at rapid pace he found himself most opportunely armed as he
the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had
marius who had emerged from the rue plumet by the boulevard traversed
the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs elysees the
place louis xv and reached the rue de rivoli the shops were open
there the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their
purchases in the stalls people were eating ices in the cafe laiter
and nibbling small cakes at the english pastry cooks shop only a few
posting chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes
marius entered the rue saint honore through the passage delorme there
the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their
half open doors people were walking about the street lanterns were
lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as
usual there was cavalry on the place du palais royal
marius followed the rue saint honore in proportion as he left the
palais royal behind him there were fewer lighted windows the shops
were fast shut no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew
sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density for the
passers by now amounted to a crowd no one could be seen to speak in
this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur
near the fountain of the arbre sec there were assemblages motionless
and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the
at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires the crowd no longer walked
it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable
block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones
there were hardly any black coats or round hats now but smock frocks
blouses caps and bristling and cadaverous heads this multitude
undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom its whisperings had the
hoarse accent of a vibration although not one of them was walking a
dull trampling was audible in the mire beyond this dense portion of
the throng in the rue du roule in the rue des prouvaires and in the
extension of the rue saint honore there was no longer a single window
in which a candle was burning only the solitary and diminishing rows
of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance the
lanterns of that date resembled large red stars hanging to ropes and
shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider
these streets were not deserted there could be descried piles of guns
moving bayonets and troops bivouacking no curious observer passed that
limit there circulation ceased there the rabble ended and the army
marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more he had been
summoned he must go he found a means to traverse the throng and to
pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrols he avoided the
sentinels he made a circuit reached the rue de bethisy and directed
his course towards the halles at the corner of the rue des bourdonnais
after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of
the troops he found himself in something startling there was no longer
a passer by no longer a soldier no longer a light there was no one
solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon
one entering a street was like entering a cellar
he took a few steps some one passed close to him at a run was it a
man or a woman were there many of them he could not have told it had
proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a lane which he judged
to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in
contact with an obstacle he extended his hands it was an overturned
wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and paving stones
scattered and piled up a barricade had been begun there and abandoned
he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the
barrier he walked very near the street posts and guided himself along
the walls of the houses a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him
that he could make out something white in front of him he approached
it took on a form it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus
harnessed by bossuet in the morning who had been straying at random all
day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary
patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man
marius left the horses behind him as he was approaching a street which
seemed to him to be the rue du contrat social a shot coming no one
knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by
him and the bullet pierced a brass shaving dish suspended above his
head over a hairdressers shop this pierced shaving dish was still
to be seen in 1848 in the rue du contrat social at the corner of the
this shot still betokened life from that instant forth he encountered
the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps
a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of
the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle
all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a
city through which run the rues saint denis and saint martin where a
thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made their
redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and
enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris there the glance
fell into an abyss thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed
windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased
the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere
and maintained order that is to say night the necessary tactics of
insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply
every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains at
dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot the light
was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed hence nothing was
stirring there was nothing but fright mourning stupor in the houses
and in the streets a sort of sacred horror not even the long rows of
windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs
and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy
pavements were visible an eye cast upward at that mass of shadows
might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there at intervals
of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and
profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and
come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated
the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above
which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of
saint jacques the church of saint merry and two or three more of those
grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms
all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters
where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a
few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have
distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble
of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were
swelling from minute to minute a formidable girdle which was slowly
the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous
cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we
have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing but
a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks
into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to
remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited
where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming invisible
combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street snares of the
sepulchre concealed in the density of night all was over no more
light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns
no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death
where how when no one knew but it was certain and inevitable in
this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government
and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the
bourgeois and the uprising groping their way were about to come into
contact the necessity was the same for both the only possible issue
thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors a situation so
extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves
seized with resolution and the most daring with terror
moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were
equal for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of
retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of
it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that
triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should
prove itself a revolution or a skirmish the government understood this
as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it hence
a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this
quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence a redoubled
anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of
emerging here only one sound was audible a sound as heart rending
as the death rattle as menacing as a malediction the tocsin of
saint merry nothing could be more blood curdling than the clamor of
that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows
as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what
men were about to do nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect
the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their
melancholy folds a black sky rested on these dead streets as though an
immense winding sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb
while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the
same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events
while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of
principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were
approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and
throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and
decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal
quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of
that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy
and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving
a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute
and of the word of god which terrifies the weak and which warns the
wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from
on high like the voice of the thunder
there everything was still calmer more obscure and more motionless than
in the neighboring streets one would have said that the glacial peace
of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the
nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the
lofty roofs of the houses which barred the rue de la chanvrerie on
the saint eustache side it was the reflection of the torch which was
burning in the corinthe barricade marius directed his steps towards
that red light it had drawn him to the marche aux poirees and he
caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des precheurs he entered

outside world at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust
his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue mondetour
a little beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chanvrerie which
cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed
he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the wine shop and
beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men
crouching down with guns on their knees all this was ten fathoms
distant from him it was the interior of the barricade
the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of
the wine shop the large barricade and the flag from him
marius had but a step more to take
then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms
he thought of that heroic colonel pontmercy who had been so proud a
soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republic and
had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa
alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who
had left on all the victorious battle fields of europe drops of that
same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray
before his time in discipline and command who had lived with his
sword belt buckled his epaulets falling on his breast his cockade
blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks
