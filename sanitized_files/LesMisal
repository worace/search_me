clearly written in luminous letters which flamed before his eyes and
changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance
in the same way he beheld as though they had passed before him in
visible forms the two ideas which had up to that time formed
the double rule of his soul the concealment of his name the
sanctification of his life for the first time they appeared to him as
absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separated them
he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was necessarily good
while the other might become bad that the first was self devotion and
that the other was personality that the one said my neighbor and that
the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other
they were antagonistic he saw them in conflict in proportion as
he meditated they grew before the eyes of his spirit they had now
attained colossal statures and it seemed to him that he beheld within
himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the
midst of the darkness and the lights a goddess and a giant contending
he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good thought
he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his
conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first
phase of his new life and that champmathieu marked the second after
but the fever allayed for an instant gradually resumed possession
of him a thousand thoughts traversed his mind but they continued to
one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter
too keenly that after all this champmathieu was not interesting and
that he had actually been guilty of theft
he answered himself if this man has indeed stolen a few apples that
means a month in prison it is a long way from that to the galleys and
who knows did he steal has it been proved the name of jean valjean
overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proofs do not the attorneys
for the crown always proceed in this manner he is supposed to be a
thief because he is known to be a convict
in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he
denounced himself the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into
consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he
had done for the district and that they would have mercy on him
but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly as he
remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him
in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction
that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise
terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life
he turned aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from
earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere he told himself
that he must do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy
after doing his duty than after having avoided it that if he allowed
things to take their own course if he remained at m sur m his
consideration his good name his good works the deference and
veneration paid to him his charity his wealth his popularity his
virtue would be seasoned with a crime and what would be the taste of
all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing while if
he accomplished his sacrifice a celestial idea would be mingled with
the galleys the post the iron necklet the green cap unceasing toil
at length he told himself that it must be so that his destiny was thus
allotted that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on
high that in any case he must make his choice virtue without and
abomination within or holiness within and infamy without
the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to
fail but his brain grow weary he began to think of other things of
the veins in his temples throbbed violently he still paced to and fro
midnight sounded first from the parish church then from the town hall
he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks and compared the sounds
of the two bells he recalled in this connection the fact that a few
days previously he had seen in an ironmongers shop an ancient clock
for sale upon which was written the name antoine albin de romainville
he was cold he lighted a small fire it did not occur to him to close
in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor he was obliged to make
a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his
thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this
ah yes he said to himself i had resolved to inform against
and then all of a sudden he thought of fantine
hold said he and what about that poor woman
fantine by appearing thus abruptly in his revery produced the effect
of an unexpected ray of light it seemed to him as though everything
about him were undergoing a change of aspect he exclaimed
ah but i have hitherto considered no one but myself it is proper for
me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself to conceal my person or
to save my soul to be a despicable and respected magistrate or an
infamous and venerable convict it is i it is always i and nothing
but i but good god all this is egotism these are diverse forms
of egotism but it is egotism all the same what if i were to think a
little about others the highest holiness is to think of others come
let us examine the matter the i excepted the i effaced the i
forgotten what would be the result of all this what if i denounce
myself i am arrested this champmathieu is released i am put back in
the galleys that is well and what then what is going on here ah
here is a country a town here are factories an industry workers
both men and women aged grandsires children poor people all this i
have created all these i provide with their living everywhere where
there is a smoking chimney it is i who have placed the brand on the
hearth and meat in the pot i have created ease circulation credit
before me there was nothing i have elevated vivified informed with
life fecundated stimulated enriched the whole country side lacking
me the soul is lacking i take myself off everything dies and this
woman who has suffered so much who possesses so many merits in spite
of her fall the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been and
that child whom i meant to go in search of whom i have promised to her
mother do i not also owe something to this woman in reparation for
the evil which i have done her if i disappear what happens the mother
dies the child becomes what it can that is what will take place if
i denounce myself if i do not denounce myself come let us see how it
will be if i do not denounce myself
after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo
a momentary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and he
well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce
he has stolen there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty
of theft for he has i remain here i go on in ten years i shall have
made ten millions i scatter them over the country i have nothing of
my own what is that to me it is not for myself that i am doing it
the prosperity of all goes on augmenting industries are aroused and
animated factories and shops are multiplied families a hundred
families a thousand families are happy the district becomes
populated villages spring up where there were only farms before
farms rise where there was nothing wretchedness disappears and
with wretchedness debauchery prostitution theft murder all vices
disappear all crimes and this poor mother rears her child and behold
a whole country rich and honest ah i was a fool i was absurd
what was that i was saying about denouncing myself i really must pay
attention and not be precipitate about anything what because it would
have pleased me to play the grand and generous this is melodrama after
all because i should have thought of no one but myself the idea for
the sake of saving from a punishment a trifle exaggerated perhaps
but just at bottom no one knows whom a thief a good for nothing
evidently a whole country side must perish a poor woman must die in
the hospital a poor little girl must die in the street like dogs ah
this is abominable and without the mother even having seen her child
once more almost without the childs having known her mother and
all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple thief who most
assuredly has deserved the galleys for something else if not for
that fine scruples indeed which save a guilty man and sacrifice the
innocent which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at
most and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel
and which sacrifice a whole population mothers wives children this
poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me and who is no
doubt blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers
those peoples are rascals and i was going to neglect my duty towards
all these poor creatures and i was going off to denounce myself and i
was about to commit that unspeakable folly let us put it at the worst
suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this and that my
conscience will reproach me for it some day to accept for the good of
others these reproaches which weigh only on myself this evil action
which compromises my soul alone in that lies self sacrifice in that
he rose and resumed his march this time he seemed to be content
diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth truths are
found only in the depths of thought it seemed to him that after
having descended into these depths after having long groped among the
darkest of these shadows he had at last found one of these diamonds
one of these truths and that he now held it in his hand and he was
yes he thought this is right i am on the right road i have the
solution i must end by holding fast to something my resolve is taken
let things take their course let us no longer vacillate let us no
longer hang back this is for the interest of all not for my own i am
madeleine and madeleine i remain woe to the man who is jean valjean
i am no longer he i do not know that man i no longer know anything it
turns out that some one is jean valjean at the present moment let him
look out for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which
was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on a head so
he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece and
hold it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man
he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short
come he said i must not flinch before any of the consequences of
the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which
attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room
there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear
witness against me it is settled all these things must disappear
he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a
small key he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly
be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which
covered the wall paper a secret receptacle opened a sort of
false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the
chimney piece in this hiding place there were some rags a blue linen
blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn
cudgel shod with iron at both ends those who had seen jean valjean at
the epoch when he passed through d in october 1815 could easily
have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit
he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in
order to remind himself continually of his starting point but he
had concealed all that came from the galleys and he had allowed the
candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen
he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it
would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick
and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without
bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously
and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all rags
illustration candlesticks into the fire 1b7 3 into the fire
he closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions
henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door
behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it
after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were
lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow everything was on fire
the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the
as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous rags which it
contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes by bending
over one could have readily recognized a coin no doubt the forty sou
he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same
all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone
vaguely on the chimney piece through the glow
hold he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them they
there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape
and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal
he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment he felt a sense
of real comfort how good warmth is said he
he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks
a minute more and they were both in the fire
at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him
his hair rose upright he became like a man who is listening to some
yes thats it finish said the voice complete what you are about
destroy these candlesticks annihilate this souvenir forget the bishop
forget everything destroy this champmathieu do that is right applaud
yourself so it is settled resolved fixed agreed here is an old man
who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing
an innocent man whose whole misfortune lies in your name upon whom
your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who
will be condemned who will finish his days in abjectness and horror
that is good be an honest man yourself remain monsieur le maire
remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent
rear the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this
time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a
man who will wear your red blouse who will bear your name in ignominy
and who will drag your chain in the galleys yes it is well arranged
the perspiration streamed from his brow he fixed a haggard eye on the
candlesticks but that within him which had spoken had not finished the
jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a
great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and
only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark
well listen infamous man all those benedictions will fall back before
they reach heaven and only the malediction will ascend to god
this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most
obscure depths of his conscience had gradually become startling and
formidable and he now heard it in his very ear it seemed to him that
it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside
of him he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly that he
glanced around the room in a sort of terror
is there any one here he demanded aloud in utter bewilderment
then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot
how stupid i am there can be no one
there was some one but the person who was there was of those whom the
he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece
then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the
dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and awoke him with a start
this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him
it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about
for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter
by change of place after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew
he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he
had arrived in turn the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him
equally fatal what a fatality what conjunction that that champmathieu
should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means
which providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his
there was a moment when he reflected on the future denounce himself
great god deliver himself up with immense despair he faced all that
he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up
once more he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so
good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty
he should never more stroll in the fields he should never more hear the
birds sing in the month of may he should never more bestow alms on the
little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having
glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house
which he had built that little chamber everything seemed charming to
him at that moment never again should he read those books never more
should he write on that little table of white wood his old portress
the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee
in the morning great god instead of that the convict gang the iron
necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell
the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well at his age
after having been what he was if he were only young again but to
be addressed in his old age as thou by any one who pleased to
be searched by the convict guard to receive the galley sergeants
cudgellings to wear iron bound shoes on his bare feet to have to
stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who
visits the gang to submit to the curiosity of strangers who would be
told that man yonder is the famous jean valjean who was mayor of
m sur m and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with
lassitude their green caps drawn over their eyes to remount two by
two the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeants whip
oh what misery can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent
being and become as monstrous as the human heart
and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma
which lay at the foundation of his revery should he remain in paradise
and become a demon should he return to hell and become an angel
what was to be done great god what was to be done
the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was
unchained afresh within him his ideas began to grow confused once
more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is
peculiar to despair the name of romainville recurred incessantly to his
mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past
he thought that romainville was a little grove near paris where young
lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april
he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly he walked like a little child
at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover
the mastery of his mind he tried to put to himself for the last time
and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen
prostrate with fatigue ought he to denounce himself ought he to hold
his peace he could not manage to see anything distinctly the vague
aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by
his meditations quivered and vanished one after the other into smoke
he only felt that to whatever course of action he made up his mind
something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being
able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the
right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death
agony the agony of his happiness or the agony of his virtue
alas all his resolution had again taken possession of him he was no
thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish eighteen hundred
years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are
summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also
long thrust aside with his hand while the olive trees quivered in
the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him
dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all
chapter iv forms assumed by suffering during sleep
three oclock in the morning had just struck and he had been walking
thus for five hours almost uninterruptedly when he at length allowed
there he fell asleep and had a dream
this dream like the majority of dreams bore no relation to the
situation except by its painful and heart rending character but it
made an impression on him this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he
wrote it down later on it is one of the papers in his own handwriting
which he has bequeathed to us we think that we have here reproduced the
of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would
be incomplete if we were to omit it it is the gloomy adventure of an
here it is on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i
i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass it
did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night
i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years
the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly
we were conversing and we met some passers by we were talking of a
neighbor of ours in former days who had always worked with her window
open from the time when she came to live on the street as we talked we
there were no trees in the plain we saw a man passing close to us he
was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was
earth color the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins
on it in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine shoot
and as heavy as iron this horseman passed and said nothing to us
my brother said to me let us take to the hollow road
there existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor
a spear of moss everything was dirt colored even the sky after
proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived
that my brother was no longer with me
i entered a village which i espied i reflected that it must be
the first street that i entered was deserted i entered a second
street behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing
erect against the wall i said to this man
what country is this where am i the man made no reply i saw the
door of a house open and i entered
the first chamber was deserted i entered the second behind the door
of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall i inquired of
this man whose house is this where am i the man replied not
the house had a garden i quitted the house and entered the garden
the garden was deserted behind the first tree i found a man standing
upright i said to this man what garden is this where am i the man
i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town all
the streets were deserted all the doors were open not a single living
being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or
strolling in the gardens but behind each angle of the walls behind
each door behind each tree stood a silent man only one was to be seen
at a time these men watched me pass
i left the town and began to ramble about the fields
after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming
up behind me i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town
they had strange heads they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they
walked faster than i did they made no noise as they walked in an
instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me the faces of these
then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town
whither are you going do you not know that you have been dead this
i opened my mouth to reply and i perceived that there was no one near
he woke he was icy cold a wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn
was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their
hinges the fire was out the candle was nearing its end it was still
he rose he went to the window there were no stars in the sky even yet
from his window the yard of the house and the street were visible a
sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the
below him he perceived two red stars whose rays lengthened and
shortened in a singular manner through the darkness
as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold
said he there are no stars in the sky they are on earth now
but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused
him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars
were the lanterns of a carriage by the light which they cast he was
able to distinguish the form of this vehicle it was a tilbury harnessed
to a small white horse the noise which he had heard was the trampling
what vehicle is this he said to himself who is coming here so early
at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber
he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice
he recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress
monsieur le maire it is just five oclock in the morning
did not monsieur le maire order a tilbury
the coachman says that he has come for monsieur le maire
that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash of lightning had
if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been
a tolerably long silence ensued he examined the flame of the candle
with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burning
wax which he rolled between his fingers the old woman waited for him
she even ventured to uplift her voice once more
what am i to say monsieur le maire
say that it is well and that i am coming down
the posting service from arras to m sur m was still operated at this
period by small mail wagons of the time of the empire these mail wagons
were two wheeled cabriolets upholstered inside with fawn colored
leather hung on springs and having but two seats one for the postboy
the other for the traveller the wheels were armed with those long
offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which
may still be seen on the road in germany the despatch box an immense
oblong coffer was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it
this coffer was painted black and the cabriolet yellow
these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something
distorted and hunchbacked about them and when one saw them passing in
the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled
the insects which are called i think termites and which though with
but little corselet drag a great train behind them but they travelled
at a very rapid rate the post wagon which set out from arras at one
oclock every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m
sur m a little before five oclock in the morning
that night the wagon which was descending to m sur m by the hesdin
road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the
town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going
in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man
enveloped in a mantle the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent
shock the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no
heed and pursued his road at full gallop
that man is in a devilish hurry said the postman
the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling
in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity
whither was he going he could not have told why was he hastening
he did not know he was driving at random straight ahead whither
to arras no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well
at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered he plunged into the
night as into a gulf something urged him forward something drew him
on no one could have told what was taking place within him every one
will understand it what man is there who has not entered at least once
in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown
however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan
done nothing none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive
he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment
he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired
scaufflaires cabriolet that whatever the result was to be there was
no reason why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters
for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took
place that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and
scrutinized that one made mountains out of everything from a distance
that at any rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some
wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him
to go to the galleys in his stead that javert would indeed be there
and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepaille old convicts who
had known him but they certainly would not recognize him bah what an
idea that javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that
all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champmathieu and
that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures
that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerge from it
that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his
own hand that he was master of it he clung to this thought
at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to
as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that
fine regular and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half
in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him
at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m sur m lay far
behind him he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the
chilly figures of a winters dawn as they passed before his eyes
but without seeing them the morning has its spectres as well as the
evening he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by
means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical these black
silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality
each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes
border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people
the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road
produced a gentle monotonous noise these things are charming when one
is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad
it was broad daylight when he arrived at hesdin he halted in front of
the inn to allow the horse a breathing spell and to have him given
the horse belonged as scaufflaire had said to that small race of the
boulonnais which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck
and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large crupper thin fine
legs and solid hoofs a homely but a robust and healthy race the
excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a
he did not get out of the tilbury the stableman who brought the oats
suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel
are you going far in this condition said the man
he replied with an air of not having roused himself from his revery
have you come from a great distance went on the man
the man bent down once more was silent for a moment with his eyes
fixed on the wheel then he rose erect and said
because though this wheel has travelled five leagues it certainly
will not travel another quarter of a league
i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues
without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway just
the wheel really had suffered serious damage the shock administered by
the mail wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the
my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here
do me the service to go and fetch him
he is only a step from here hey master bourgaillard
master bourgaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold
he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the
there is a long days work on it are you in a hurry sir
in a very great hurry i must set out again in an hour at the latest
impossible to day two new spokes and a hub must be made monsieur will
not be able to start before to morrow morning
the matter cannot wait until to morrow what if you were to replace
have you not a wheel that you can sell me then i could start again at
i have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet two wheels make
a pair two wheels cannot be put together hap hazard
in that case sell me a pair of wheels
it is useless sir i have nothing to sell but cart wheels we are but
have you a cabriolet that you can let me have
the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a
you treat the cabriolets that people let you so well if i had one i
what not even a spring cart i am not hard to please as you see
we live in a poor country there is in truth added the wheelwright
an old calash under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of
the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the
thirty sixth of the month never that is to say i might let that
to you for what matters it to me but the bourgeois must not see it
pass and then it is a calash it would require two horses
and monsieur wishes to reach there to day
does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four oclock
there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking
well by taking post horses monsieur cannot reach arras before
to morrow we are on a cross road the relays are badly served the
horses are in the fields the season for ploughing is just beginning
heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from
the post as well as elsewhere monsieur will have to wait three or four
hours at the least at every relay and then they drive at a walk
come then i will go on horseback unharness the cabriolet some one
can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood
without doubt but will this horse bear the saddle
that is true you remind me of that he will not bear it
but i can surely hire a horse in the village
a horse to travel to arras at one stretch
that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts you
would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you but you
will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a
the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and
is there not a mail wagon which runs to arras when will it pass
to night both the posts pass at night the one going as well as the
what it will take you a day to mend this wheel
what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes
that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is
is there any one in this village who lets out teams
the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the
it was evident that providence was intervening that it was it who had
broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road
he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every
possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously
exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season nor
fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach
himself if he went no further that was no fault of his it did not
concern him further it was no longer his fault it was not the act of
his own conscience but the act of providence
he breathed again he breathed freely and to the full extent of his
lungs for the first time since javerts visit it seemed to him that the
hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty
it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself
