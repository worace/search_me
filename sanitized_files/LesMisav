the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning
himself has been absent from paris for many years paris has been
transformed since he quitted it a new city has arisen which is after
a fashion unknown to him there is no need for him to say that he loves
paris paris is his minds natal city in consequence of demolitions and
reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore away
religiously in his memory is now a paris of days gone by he must
be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed it is
possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says
in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street
nor house will any longer exist in that locality readers may verify
the facts if they care to take the trouble for his own part he is
unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before
his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him it is a delight to him
to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he
beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished
so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those
streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows
those roofs and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are
strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered
haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to
you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones later on
when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to
you that you miss those roofs those doors and that those walls are
necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered
those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left
a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements
all those places which you no longer behold which you may never
behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on
a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an
apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak
the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they
are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no
change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the
may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present that
said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continue
jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the
streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise
returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being
illustration the black hunt 2b5 1 black hunt
this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag on soil where an
imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other
advantages that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing
them on the wrong scent in venery this is called false re imbushment
the moon was full that night jean valjean was not sorry for this the
moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and
shadow in the streets jean valjean could glide along close to the
houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did
not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the
dark side escaped him still in the deserted lanes which lie near the
rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no one was following him
cosette walked on without asking any questions the sufferings of the
first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her
nature moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently
have occasion to recur she had grown used without being herself
aware of it to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of
destiny and then she was with him and she felt safe
jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette he
trusted in god as she trusted in him it seemed as though he also were
clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself he thought he
felt a being leading him though invisible however he had no settled
idea no plan no project he was not even absolutely sure that it was
javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that
he was jean valjean was not he disguised was not he believed to be
dead still queer things had been going on for several days he wanted
no more of them he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house
like the wild animal chased from its lair he was seeking a hole in
which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell
jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard
quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the
middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in
various manners with cunning strategy the rue censier and the rue
copeau the rue du battoir saint victor and the rue du puits lermite
there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter
one finding nothing which suited him he had no doubt that if any one
had chanced to be upon his track they would have lost it
as eleven oclock struck from saint etienne du mont he was traversing
the rue de pontoise in front of the office of the commissary of police
situated at no 14 a few moments later the instinct of which we have
spoken above made him turn round at that moment he saw distinctly
thanks to the commissarys lantern which betrayed them three men
who were following him closely pass one after the other under that
lantern on the dark side of the street one of the three entered the
alley leading to the commissarys house the one who marched at their
come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue
he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarches which was
closed on account of the hour strode along the rue de lepee de bois
and the rue de larbalete and plunged into the rue des postes
at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of
streets where the college rollin stands to day and where the rue
it is understood of course that the rue neuve sainte genevieve is an
old street and that a posting chaise does not pass through the rue des
postes once in ten years in the thirteenth century this rue des postes
was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue des pots
the moon cast a livid light into this open space jean valjean went into
ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following
him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed
in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their
appearance there were four of them now all were tall dressed in long
brown coats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands their
great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming
than did their sinister stride through the darkness one would have
they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in
consultation they had an air of indecision the one who appeared to be
their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the
direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the
contrary direction with considerable obstinacy at the moment when the
first man wheeled round the moon fell full in his face jean valjean
chapter ii it is lucky that the pont dausterlitz bears carriages
uncertainty was at an end for jean valjean fortunately it still lasted
for the men he took advantage of their hesitation it was time lost for
them but gained for him he slipped from under the gate where he had
concealed himself and went down the rue des postes towards the region
of the jardin des plantes cosette was beginning to be tired he took
her in his arms and carried her there were no passers by and the
street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon
in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries on the front
of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient
des pots a fleurs des tuyaux de la brique
a tout venant le coeur vend des carreaux
he left behind him the rue de la clef then the fountain saint victor
skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets and reached the
quay there he turned round the quay was deserted the streets were
deserted there was no one behind him he drew a long breath
tolls were still collected there at that epoch
he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou
it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge you are
carrying a child who can walk pay for two
he paid vexed that his passage should have aroused remark every flight
a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on
its way like him to the right bank this was of use to him he could
traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart
towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were benumbed
wanted to walk he set her on the ground and took her hand again
the bridge once crossed he perceived some timber yards on his right he
directed his course thither in order to reach them it was necessary to
risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space
he did not hesitate those who were on his track had evidently lost the
scent and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger hunted
a little street the rue du chemin vert saint antoine opened out
between two timber yards enclosed in walls this street was dark and
narrow and seemed made expressly for him before entering it he cast a
from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont
four shadows were just entering on the bridge
these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were
jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured
one hope remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped
on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the
large illuminated space holding cosette by the hand
in that case by plunging into the little street before him he
might escape if he could reach the timber yards the marshes the
market gardens the uninhabited ground which was not built upon
it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little
chapter iii to wit the plan of paris in 1727
three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street
forked it separated into two streets which ran in a slanting line one
to the right and the other to the left
jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a y
which should he choose he did not hesitate but took the one on the
because that to the left ran towards a suburb that is to say towards
inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that
however they no longer walked very fast cosettes pace retarded jean
he took her up and carried her again cosette laid her head on the
shoulder of the good man and said not a word
he turned round from time to time and looked behind him he took care to
keep always on the dark side of the street the street was straight
in his rear the first two or three times that he turned round he saw
nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march somewhat
reassured all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the
portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the
he rushed forward precipitately rather than walked hoping to find some
side street to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent
this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was
a wall which bordered a transverse street in which the one he had taken
here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he go to the
he glanced to the right the fragmentary lane was prolonged between
buildings which were either sheds or barns then ended at a blind alley
the extremity of the cul de sac was distinctly visible a lofty white
he glanced to the left on that side the lane was open and about
two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the
at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left in
an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane he
perceived a sort of motionless black statue at the corner of the lane
and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps
it was some one a man who had evidently just been posted there and
the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between
the faubourg saint antoine and la rapee is one of those which recent
improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in
disfigurement according to some and in a transfiguration according to
others the market gardens the timber yards and the old buildings
have been effaced to day there are brand new wide streets arenas
circuses hippodromes railway stations and a prison mazas there
progress as the reader sees with its antidote
half a century ago in that ordinary popular tongue which is all
compounded of traditions which persists in calling the institut les
quatre nations and the opera comique feydeau the precise spot
whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit picpus the
porte saint jacques the porte paris the barriere des sergents the
porcherons la galiote les celestins les capucins le mail la bourbe
larbre de cracovie la petite pologne these are the names of old paris
which survive amid the new the memory of the populace hovers over these
le petit picpus which moreover hardly ever had any existence and
never was more than the outline of a quarter had nearly the monkish
aspect of a spanish town the roads were not much paved the streets
were not much built up with the exception of the two or three streets
of which we shall presently speak all was wall and solitude there not
a shop not a vehicle hardly a candle lighted here and there in the
windows all lights extinguished after ten oclock gardens convents
timber yards marshes occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as
such was this quarter in the last century the revolution snubbed
it soundly the republican government demolished and cut through it
rubbish shoots were established there thirty years ago this quarter
was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings to day
it has been utterly blotted out the petit picpus of which no existing
plan has preserved a trace is indicated with sufficient clearness
in the plan of 1727 published at paris by denis thierry rue
saint jacques opposite the rue du platre and at lyons by jean girin
rue merciere at the sign of prudence petit picpus had as
we have just mentioned a y of streets formed by the rue du
chemin vert saint antoine which spread out in two branches taking on
the left the name of little picpus street and on the right the name of
the rue polonceau the two limbs of the y were connected at the apex
as by a bar this bar was called rue droit mur the rue polonceau ended
there rue petit picpus passed on and ascended towards the lenoir
market a person coming from the seine reached the extremity of the rue
polonceau and had on his right the rue droit mur turning abruptly at a
right angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his right a
truncated prolongation of the rue droit mur which had no issue and was
as we have just said on catching sight of that black silhouette
standing on guard at the angle of the rue droit mur and the rue
petit picpus he recoiled there could be no doubt of it that phantom
the time for retreating was passed that which he had perceived in
movement an instant before in the distant darkness was javert and his
squad without a doubt javert was probably already at the commencement
of the street at whose end jean valjean stood javert to all
appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken
his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit these
surmises which so closely resembled proofs whirled suddenly like a
handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind through jean
valjeans mournful brain he examined the cul de sac genrot there he
was cut off he examined the rue petit picpus there stood a sentinel
he saw that black form standing out in relief against the white
pavement illuminated by the moon to advance was to fall into this
mans hands to retreat was to fling himself into javerts arms jean
valjean felt himself caught as in a net which was slowly contracting
in order to understand what follows it is requisite to form an exact
idea of the droit mur lane and in particular of the angle which one
leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polonceau into this
lane droit mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right as far
as the rue petit picpus by houses of mean aspect on the left by a
solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which
grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue
petit picpus side so that this building which was very lofty on the
rue petit picpus side was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue
polonceau there at the angle of which we have spoken it descended to
such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall this wall did not abut
directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed
by its two corners from two observers who might have been one in the
rue polonceau the other in the rue droit mur
beginning with these angles of the niche the wall extended along the
rue polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49 and along the
rue droit mur where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy
building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected thus
forming another retreating angle in the street this gable was sombre
of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two
shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed
the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is
rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the
the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal
and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular
planks the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by
long transverse strips of iron at one side there was a carriage gate of
the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than
a linden tree showed its crest above the niche and the wall was covered
with ivy on the side of the rue polonceau
in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre
building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him
he ran his eyes rapidly over it he said to himself that if he could
contrive to get inside it he might save himself first he conceived an
in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue
droit mur side there were at all the windows of the different stories
ancient cistern pipes of lead the various branches of the pipes which
led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort
of tree on the front these ramifications of pipes with their hundred
elbows imitated those old leafless vine stocks which writhe over the
this odd espalier with its branches of lead and iron was the first
thing that struck jean valjean he seated cosette with her back against
a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where
the conduit touched the pavement perhaps there was some way of climbing
up by it and entering the house but the pipe was dilapidated and past
service and hardly hung to its fastenings moreover all the windows
of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic
windows in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that facade and
the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen
jean valjean in the act of climbing and finally what was to be done
with cosette how was she to be drawn up to the top of a three story
he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain pipe and crawled
along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau
when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he
noticed that no one could see him there as we have just explained he
was concealed from all eyes no matter from which direction they were
approaching besides this he was in the shadow finally there were
two doors perhaps they might be forced the wall above which he saw the
linden tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could at
least hide himself although there were as yet no leaves on the trees
he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that
he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully
decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the planks were
rotten the iron bands there were only three of them were rusted it
seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm eaten barrier
on examining it he found that the door was not a door it had neither
hinges cross bars lock nor fissure in the middle the iron bands
traversed it from side to side without any break through the crevices
in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone
roughly cemented together which passers by might still have seen there
ten years ago he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this
apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against
which it was placed it was easy to tear off a plank but then one
found ones self face to face with a wall
chapter v which would be impossible with gas lanterns
at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some
distance jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street
seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just debouched
into the rue polonceau he saw the gleam of their bayonets they were
advancing towards him these soldiers at whose head he distinguished
javerts tall figure advanced slowly and cautiously they halted
frequently it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the
walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys
this was some patrol that javert had encountered there could be no
mistake as to this surmise and whose aid he had demanded
javerts two acolytes were marching in their ranks
at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the
halts which they were making it would take them about a quarter of
an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it was a frightful
moment a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible
precipice which yawned before him for the third time and the galleys
now meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is
to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb
there was but one thing which was possible
jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say
two beggars pouches in one he kept his saintly thoughts in the other
the redoubtable talents of a convict he rummaged in the one or the
among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the
prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a past master in the
incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing irons by sheer
muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his
hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the
stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story if need
be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner
of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which battemolle condemned
to death made his escape twenty years ago
jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the
linden it was about eighteen feet in height the angle which it formed
with the gable of the large building was filled at its lower extremity
by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to
preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty
creatures called the passers by this practice of filling up corners of
the wall is much in use in paris
this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of
this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen
the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping
cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall
should he abandon her jean valjean did not once think of that it
was impossible to carry her a mans whole strength is required to
successfully carry out these singular ascents the least burden would
disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards
a rope would have been required jean valjean had none where was he to
get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau certainly if jean valjean
had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment
all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes
jean valjeans despairing glance fell on the street lantern post of the
at that epoch there were no gas jets in the streets of paris at
nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were
ascended and descended by means of a rope which traversed the street
from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post the pulley
over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little
iron box the key to which was kept by the lamp lighter and the rope
jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street
at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box
with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette
once more he had a rope these gloomy inventors of expedients work
we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that
night the lantern in the cul de sac genrot was thus naturally extinct
like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even
noticing that it was no longer in its place
nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean valjeans
absorption his singular gestures his goings and comings all had begun
to render cosette uneasy any other child than she would have given vent
to loud shrieks long before she contented herself with plucking jean
valjean by the skirt of his coat they could hear the sound of the
father said she in a very low voice i am afraid who is coming
hush replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier
say nothing dont interfere with me if you cry out if you weep the
thenardier is lying in wait for you she is coming to take you back
then without haste but without making a useless movement with firm
and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and
javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it
round cosettes body under the armpits taking care that it should not
hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the rope by means of
that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot took the other end
of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which
he threw over the wall stepped upon the mass of masonry and began
to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much
solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his
feet and elbows half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on
cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word jean
valjeans injunction and the name of madame thenardier had chilled her
all at once she heard jean valjeans voice crying to her though in a
dont say a word and dont be alarmed went on jean valjean
and she felt herself lifted from the ground
before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall
jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands
in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along
on top of the wall as far as the cant as he had guessed there stood
a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and
descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle
slope which grazed the linden tree a lucky circumstance for the wall
was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could
only see the ground at a great depth below him
he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the
crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the
patrol the thundering voice of javert was audible
search the blind alley the rue droit mur is guarded so is the rue
petit picpus ill answer for it that he is in the blind alley
jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast
to cosette reached the linden tree and leaped to the ground whether
from terror or courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her
jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and
of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to
be looked at in winter and at night this garden was oblong in shape
with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest
trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could
be seen a very large solitary tree then several fruit trees gnarled
and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose
glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well here and
there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss the alleys were
bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs the grass had half
taken possession of them and a green mould covered the rest
jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as
a means of descent a pile of fagots and behind the fagots directly
against the wall a stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer
anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the
the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were
distinguishable one of which much encumbered seemed to serve as a
the large building of the rue droit mur which had a wing on the rue
petit picpus turned two facades at right angles towards this garden
these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior all
the windows were grated not a gleam of light was visible at any one of
them the upper story had scuttles like prisons one of those facades
cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense
no other house was visible the bottom of the garden was lost in mist
and darkness nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which
intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the
nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined there
was no one in it which was quite natural in view of the hour but it
did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in even
jean valjeans first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them
on again then to step under the shed with cosette a man who is fleeing
never thinks himself sufficiently hidden the child whose thoughts were
still on the thenardier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight
cosette trembled and pressed close to him they heard the tumultuous
noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets the blows
of their gun stocks against the stones javerts appeals to the police
spies whom he had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that
species of stormy roar were becoming more distant jean valjean held his
he had laid his hand lightly on cosettes mouth
however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this
frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so
much as the shadow of a misgiving it seemed as though those walls had
been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a
sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been
horrible it was a hymn which issued from the gloom a dazzling burst
of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night
womens voices but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure
accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which
are not of the earth and which resemble those that the newborn infant
still hears and which the dying man hears already this song proceeded
from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden at the moment
when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of
cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees
they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of
them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that
these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent
the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in
while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no
longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seemed to him that he
felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding
the song died away it may have lasted a long time jean valjean could
not have told hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment
all fell silent again there was no longer anything in the street
there was nothing in the garden that which had menaced that which had
reassured him all had vanished the breeze swayed a few dry weeds
on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy
the night wind had risen which indicated that it must be between one
and two oclock in the morning poor cosette said nothing as she had
seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean
had fancied that she was asleep he bent down and looked at her
cosettes eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pained jean
jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to
ah said he she is gone you need fear nothing further
the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast
the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more
keen every instant the goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round
well wait for me a moment i will soon be back
he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better
shelter he came across doors but they were closed there were bars at
just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed
that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light
he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows they all
opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up
by arcades and pillars where only a tiny light and great shadows were
visible the light came from a taper which was burning in one
corner the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it
nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the
ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet and
which resembled a human form this form was lying face downward flat
on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of a cross in the
immobility of death one would have said judging from a sort of serpent
which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round
the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely
jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal
spectres had crossed his path in life he had never beheld anything more
blood curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing
some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and beheld thus at
night it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and
still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive
he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch
whether the thing would move in spite of his remaining thus what seemed
to him a very long time the outstretched form made no movement all
at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror and he
fled he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him
it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form
following him with great strides and waving its arms
he reached the ruin all out of breath his knees were giving way beneath
where was he who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of
sepulchre in the midst of paris what was this strange house an edifice
full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with
the voice of angels and when they came offering them abruptly that
terrible vision promising to open the radiant portals of heaven and
then opening the horrible gates of the tomb and it actually was an
edifice a house which bore a number on the street it was not a dream
he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact
cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him a
genuine fever and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain
he stepped up to cosette she was asleep
the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep
he sat down beside her and began to think little by little as he gazed
at her he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind
he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth
that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should
need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her he
was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his
nevertheless athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard
for some time a peculiar noise it was like the tinkling of a bell this
sound proceeded from the garden it could be heard distinctly though
faintly it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of
he looked and saw that there was some one in the garden
a being resembling a man was walking amid the bell glasses of the melon
beds rising stooping halting with regular movements as though he
were dragging or spreading out something on the ground this person
jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy for
them everything is hostile and suspicious they distrust the day
because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids
in surprising them a little while before he had shivered because the
garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was some one
he fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors he said to himself
that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that
they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this
man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against
thieves and deliver him up he took the sleeping cosette gently in his
arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of
use in the most remote corner of the shed cosette did not stir
from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the
melon patch the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell
followed each of this mans movements when the man approached the
sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he
made any hasty gesture a tremolo accompanied the gesture when he
halted the sound ceased it appeared evident that the bell was attached
to that man but what could that signify who was this man who had a
bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox
as he put these questions to himself he touched cosettes hands they
he spoke to her in a low voice
is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering
the most frightful thoughts rushed pell mell through his mind there
are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and
violently force the partitions of our brains when those we love are in
question our prudence invents every sort of madness he remembered that
sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal
cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his
he listened to her breathing she still breathed but with a respiration
which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction
how was he to warm her back to life how was he to rouse her all that
was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts he rushed wildly
it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a
fire in less than a quarter of an hour
he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had taken
in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat
the mans head was bent down and he did not see him approaching in a
the man gave a start and raised his eyes
you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will
the moon shone full upon jean valjeans terrified countenance
what so it is you father madeleine said the man
that name thus pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot
by that strange man made jean valjean start back
he had expected anything but that the person who thus addressed him was
a bent and lame old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his
left knee a leather knee cap whence hung a moderately large bell his
face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable
however the goodman had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all
ah good god how come you here father madeleine where did you enter
dieu jesus did you fall from heaven there is no trouble about that
if ever you do fall it will be from there and what a state you are in
you have no cravat you have no hat you have no coat do you know you
would have frightened any one who did not know you no coat lord god
are the saints going mad nowadays but how did you get in here
his words tumbled over each other the goodman talked with a rustic
volubility in which there was nothing alarming all this was uttered
with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness
who are you and what house is this demanded jean valjean
ah pardieu this is too much exclaimed the old man i am the person
for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had
no said jean valjean and how happens it that you know me
he turned a ray of moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean
ah said jean valjean so it is you yes i recollect you
that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful tone
and what are you doing here resumed jean valjean
why i am covering my melons of course
in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old fauchelevent
held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in
spreading over the melon bed during the hour or thereabouts that he had
been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them it was
this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements
i said to myself the moon is bright it is going to freeze what if i
were to put my melons into their greatcoats and he added looking at
jean valjean with a broad smile pardieu you ought to have done the
jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the
name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution he multiplied
