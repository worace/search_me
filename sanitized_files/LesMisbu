rest unable to sleep except when standing erect and awakened every
moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more in order to
eat they pushed the bread which was flung to them in the mud along
their leg with their heel until it reached their hand
how long did they remain thus one month two months six months
sometimes one stayed a year it was the antechamber of the galleys
men were put there for stealing a hare from the king in this
sepulchre hell what did they do what man can do in a sepulchre they
went through the agonies of death and what can man do in hell they
sang for song lingers where there is no longer any hope in the waters
of malta when a galley was approaching the song could be heard before
the sound of the oars poor survincent the poacher who had gone
through the prison cellar of the chatelet said it was the rhymes that
kept me up uselessness of poetry what is the good of rhyme
it is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth
it is from the dungeon of the grand chatelet of paris that comes
the melancholy refrain of the montgomery galley timaloumisaine
icicaille est la theatre here is the theatre

do what you will you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart
in this world of dismal deeds people keep their secrets the secret is
the thing above all others the secret in the eyes of these wretches
is unity which serves as a base of union to betray a secret is to
tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own
personality to inform against in the energetic slang dialect is
called to eat the bit as though the informer drew to himself a
little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each
what does it signify to receive a box on the ear commonplace metaphor
replies it is to see thirty six candles
here slang intervenes and takes it up candle camoufle thereupon the
ordinary tongue gives camouflet42 as the synonym for soufflet thus
by a sort of infiltration from below upwards with the aid of metaphor
that incalculable trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the
academy and poulailler saying i light my camoufle causes voltaire
to write langleviel la beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets
researches in slang mean discoveries at every step study and
investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of
intersection of regular society with society which is accursed

alas will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness
is it her destiny there to await forever the mind the liberator the
immense rider of pegasi and hippo griffs the combatant of heroes of
the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings the radiant
knight of the future will she forever summon in vain to her assistance
the lance of light of the ideal is she condemned to hear the fearful
approach of evil through the density of the gulf and to catch glimpses
nearer and nearer at hand beneath the hideous water of that dragons

chapter iii slang which weeps and slang which laughs
as the reader perceives slang in its entirety slang of four hundred
years ago like the slang of to day is permeated with that sombre
symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful
now menacing one feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those
vagrants of the court of miracles who played at cards with packs of
their own some of which have come down to us the eight of clubs for
instance represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves
a sort of fantastic personification of the forest at the foot of this
tree a fire was burning over which three hares were roasting a huntsman
on a spit and behind him on another fire hung a steaming pot whence
emerged the head of a dog nothing can be more melancholy than these
reprisals in painting by a pack of cards in the presence of stakes
for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of
counterfeiters the diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm
of slang even song even raillery even menace all partook of this
powerless and dejected character all the songs the melodies of some
of which have been collected were humble and lamentable to the point of
evoking tears the pegre is always the poor pegre and he is always
the hare in hiding the fugitive mouse the flying bird he hardly
complains he contents himself with sighing one of his moans has come
down to us i do not understand how god the father of men can torture
his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry without himself
suffering torture43 the wretch whenever he has time to think makes
himself small before the low and frail in the presence of society
he lies down flat on his face he entreats he appeals to the side of
compassion we feel that he is conscious of his guilt
towards the middle of the last century a change took place prison songs
and thieves ritournelles assumed so to speak an insolent and jovial
mien the plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla we find in the
eighteenth century in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons
a diabolical and enigmatical gayety we hear this strident and lilting
refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent
gleam and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a
this was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a
a serious symptom in the eighteenth century the ancient melancholy of
the dejected classes vanishes they began to laugh they rally the grand
meg and the grand dab given louis xv they call the king of france le
marquis de pantin and behold they are almost gay a sort of gleam
proceeds from these miserable wretches as though their consciences were
not heavy within them any more these lamentable tribes of darkness have
no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions they possess the
heedless audacity of mind a sign that they are losing the sense of
their criminality and that they feel even among thinkers and dreamers
some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of a
sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and
sophisms in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness while
communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines a sign in short of
some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall
let us pause a moment whom are we accusing here is it the eighteenth
century is it philosophy certainly not the work of the eighteenth
century is healthy and good and wholesome the encyclopedists diderot
at their head the physiocrates turgot at their head the philosophers
voltaire at their head the utopians rousseau at their head these are
four sacred legions humanitys immense advance towards the light is due
to them they are the four vanguards of the human race marching towards
the four cardinal points of progress diderot towards the beautiful
turgot towards the useful voltaire towards the true rousseau towards
the just but by the side of and above the philosophers there were the
sophists a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth hemlock
in the virgin forest while the executioner was burning the great
books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the
court house writers now forgotten were publishing with the kings
sanction no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings which were
eagerly read by the unfortunate some of these publications odd to
say which were patronized by a prince are to be found in the secret
library these facts significant but unknown were imperceptible on the
surface sometimes in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger
it is obscure because it is underhand of all these writers the one
who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was
this work peculiar to the whole of europe effected more ravages in
germany than anywhere else in germany during a given period summed up
by schiller in his famous drama the robbers theft and pillage rose up
in protest against property and labor assimilated certain specious and
false elementary ideas which though just in appearance were absurd in
reality enveloped themselves in these ideas disappeared within them
after a fashion assumed an abstract name passed into the state of
theory and in that shape circulated among the laborious suffering and
honest masses unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared
the mixture unknown even to the masses who accepted it whenever a fact
of this sort presents itself the case is grave suffering engenders
wrath and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep
which is the same thing as shutting ones eyes the hatred of the
unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill made
spirit which dreams in a corner and sets itself to the scrutiny of
society the scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing
hence if the ill fortune of the times so wills it those fearful
commotions which were formerly called jacqueries beside which purely
political agitations are the merest childs play which are no longer
the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor but the revolt of
it is this peril possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth
century which the french revolution that immense act of probity cut
the french revolution which is nothing else than the idea armed with
the sword rose erect and with the same abrupt movement closed the
door of ill and opened the door of good
it put a stop to torture promulgated the truth expelled miasma
it may be said of it that it created man a second time by giving him a
the nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work and
to day the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply
impossible blind is he who announces it foolish is he who fears it
thanks to the revolution social conditions have changed feudal and
monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood there is no more of
the middle ages in our constitution we no longer live in the days when
terrible swarms within made irruptions when one heard beneath his feet
the obscure course of a dull rumble when indescribable elevations from
mole like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization where the
soil cracked open where the roofs of caverns yawned and where one
suddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth
the revolutionary sense is a moral sense the sentiment of right once
developed develops the sentiment of duty the law of all is
liberty which ends where the liberty of others begins according to
robespierres admirable definition since 89 the whole people has
been dilating into a sublime individual there is not a poor man who
possessing his right has not his ray of sun the die of hunger feels
within him the honesty of france the dignity of the citizen is an
internal armor he who is free is scrupulous he who votes reigns hence
incorruptibility hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts hence eyes
is such that on a day of deliverance a 14th of july a 10th of august
there is no longer any populace the first cry of the enlightened and
increasing throngs is death to thieves progress is an honest man the
ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket handkerchiefs by whom were
the wagons containing the wealth of the tuileries escorted in 1848 by
the rag pickers of the faubourg saint antoine rags mounted guard over
the treasure virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent in
those wagons in chests hardly closed and some even half open amid a
hundred dazzling caskets was that ancient crown of france studded with
diamonds surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty by the regent diamond
which was worth thirty millions barefooted they guarded that crown
hence no more jacquerie i regret it for the sake of the skilful the
old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter and henceforth
it can no longer be employed in politics the principal spring of the
red spectre is broken every one knows it now the scare crow scares
no longer the birds take liberties with the mannikin foul creatures
alight upon it the bourgeois laugh at it
chapter iv the two duties to watch and to hope
this being the case is all social danger dispelled certainly not
there is no jacquerie society may rest assured on that point blood
will no longer rush to its head but let society take heed to the manner
in which it breathes apoplexy is no longer to be feared but phthisis
one can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by
let us not weary of repeating and sympathetic souls must not forget
that this is the first of fraternal obligations and selfish hearts must
understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking
first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs in solacing
airing enlightening loving them in enlarging their horizon to a
magnificent extent in lavishing upon them education in every form in
offering them the example of labor never the example of idleness
in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the
universal aim in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit
to wealth in creating vast fields of public and popular activity in
having like briareus a hundred hands to extend in all directions to
the oppressed and the feeble in employing the collective power for that
grand duty of opening workshops for all arms schools for all aptitudes
and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence in augmenting
salaries diminishing trouble balancing what should be and what is
that is to say in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need
in a word in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more
comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant
and let us say it all this is but the beginning the true question is
this labor cannot be a law without being a right
we will not insist upon this point this is not the proper place for
if nature calls itself providence society should call itself foresight
intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material
improvement to know is a sacrament to think is the prime necessity
truth is nourishment as well as grain a reason which fasts from science
and wisdom grows thin let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and
minds which do not eat if there is anything more heart breaking than
a body perishing for lack of bread it is a soul which is dying from
the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution some day we
shall be amazed as the human race mounts upward the deep layers emerge
naturally from the zone of distress the obliteration of misery will be
we should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation
the past is very strong it is true at the present moment it censures
this rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising behold it is walking and
advancing it seems a victor this dead body is a conqueror he arrives
with his legions superstitions with his sword despotism with his
banner ignorance a while ago he won ten battles he advances he
threatens he laughs he is at our doors let us not despair on our
side let us sell the field on which hannibal is encamped
what have we to fear we who believe
no such thing as a back flow of ideas exists any more than there exists
a return of a river on its course
but let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter when
they say no to progress it is not the future but themselves that
they are condemning they are giving themselves a sad malady they are
inoculating themselves with the past there is but one way of rejecting
now no death that of the body as late as possible that of the soul
yes the enigma will utter its word the sphinx will speak the problem
yes the people sketched out by the eighteenth century will be
finished by the nineteenth he who doubts this is an idiot the future
blossoming the near blossoming forth of universal well being is a
immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them
within a given time to a logical state that is to say to a state of
equilibrium that is to say to equity a force composed of earth and
heaven results from humanity and governs it this force is a worker
of miracles marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than
extraordinary vicissitudes aided by science which comes from one man
and by the event which comes from another it is not greatly alarmed
by these contradictions in the attitude of problems which seem
impossibilities to the vulgar herd it is no less skilful at causing a
solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas than a lesson
from the reconciliation of facts and we may expect anything from that
mysterious power of progress which brought the orient and the occident
face to face one fine day in the depths of a sepulchre and made the
imaums converse with bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid
in the meantime let there be no halt no hesitation no pause in the
grandiose onward march of minds social philosophy consists essentially
in science and peace its object is and its result must be to dissolve
wrath by the study of antagonisms it examines it scrutinizes it
analyzes then it puts together once more it proceeds by means of
more than once a society has been seen to give way before the wind
which is let loose upon mankind history is full of the shipwrecks of
nations and empires manners customs laws religions and some fine
day that unknown force the hurricane passes by and bears them all
away the civilizations of india of chaldea of persia of syria of
egypt have disappeared one after the other why we know not what are
the causes of these disasters we do not know could these societies
have been saved was it their fault did they persist in the fatal vice
which destroyed them what is the amount of suicide in these terrible
deaths of a nation and a race questions to which there exists no reply
darkness enwraps condemned civilizations they sprung a leak then they
sank we have nothing more to say and it is with a sort of terror that
we look on at the bottom of that sea which is called the past behind
those colossal waves at the shipwreck of those immense vessels
babylon nineveh tarsus thebes rome beneath the fearful gusts which
emerge from all the mouths of the shadows but shadows are there and
light is here we are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient
civilizations we do not know the infirmities of our own everywhere
upon it we have the right of light we contemplate its beauties we
lay bare its defects where it is ill we probe and the sickness once
diagnosed the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy
our civilization the work of twenty centuries is its law and its
prodigy it is worth the trouble of saving it will be saved it is
already much to have solaced it its enlightenment is yet another point
all the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards
this point the thinker of to day has a great duty to auscultate
we repeat that this auscultation brings encouragement it is by this
persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages an
austere interlude in a mournful drama beneath the social mortality we
feel human imperishableness the globe does not perish because it has
these wounds craters eruptions sulphur pits here and there nor
because of a volcano which ejects its pus the maladies of the people do
and yet any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his
head at times the strongest the tenderest the most logical have their
will the future arrive it seems as though we might almost put
this question when we behold so much terrible darkness melancholy
face to face encounter of selfish and wretched on the part of
the selfish the prejudices shadows of costly education appetite
increasing through intoxication a giddiness of prosperity which dulls
a fear of suffering which in some goes as far as an aversion for the
suffering an implacable satisfaction the i so swollen that it bars the
soul on the side of the wretched covetousness envy hatred of seeing
others enjoy the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging
its desires hearts full of mist sadness need fatality impure and
shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven is the luminous point
which we distinguish there one of those which vanish the ideal
is frightful to behold thus lost in the depths small isolated
imperceptible brilliant but surrounded by those great black menaces
monstrously heaped around it yet no more in danger than a star in the
the reader has probably understood that eponine having recognized
through the gate the inhabitant of that rue plumet whither magnon had
sent her had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the rue plumet
and had then conducted marius thither and that after many days spent
in ecstasy before that gate marius drawn on by that force which draws
the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built
the house of her whom he loves had finally entered cosettes garden as
romeo entered the garden of juliet this had even proved easier for him
than for romeo romeo was obliged to scale a wall marius had only
to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which
vacillated in its rusty recess after the fashion of old peoples teeth
as there was never any one in the street and as marius never entered
the garden except at night he ran no risk of being seen
beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these
two souls marius was there every evening if at that period of
her existence cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least
unscrupulous or debauched she would have been lost for there are
generous natures which yield themselves and cosette was one of them
one of womans magnanimities is to yield love at the height where it
is absolute is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness
of modesty but what dangers you run o noble souls often you give the
heart and we take the body your heart remains with you you gaze upon
it in the gloom with a shudder love has no middle course it either
ruins or it saves all human destiny lies in this dilemma this dilemma
ruin or safety is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than
by love love is life if it is not death cradle also coffin the same
sentiment says yes and no in the human heart of all the things that
god has made the human heart is the one which sheds the most light
god willed that cosettes love should encounter one of the loves which
throughout the whole of the month of may of that year 1832 there were
there in every night in that poor neglected garden beneath that
thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day two beings
composed of all chastity all innocence overflowing with all the
felicity of heaven nearer to the archangels than to mankind pure
honest intoxicated radiant who shone for each other amid the shadows
it seemed to cosette that marius had a crown and to marius that cosette
had a nimbus they touched each other they gazed at each other they
clasped each others hands they pressed close to each other but there
was a distance which they did not pass not that they respected it
they did not know of its existence marius was conscious of a barrier
cosettes innocence and cosette of a support marius loyalty the
first kiss had also been the last marius since that time had not gone
further than to touch cosettes hand or her kerchief or a lock of her
hair with his lips for him cosette was a perfume and not a woman
he inhaled her she refused nothing and he asked nothing cosette was
happy and marius was satisfied they lived in this ecstatic state which
can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul it was
the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal two swans
at that hour of love an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute
beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy marius the pure and seraphic
marius would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised
cosettes robe to the height of her ankle once in the moonlight
cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground her bodice fell
apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat marius
what took place between these two beings nothing they adored each
at night when they were there that garden seemed a living and a sacred
spot all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they
opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers the wanton and
vigorous vegetation quivered full of strength and intoxication around
these two innocents and they uttered words of love which set the trees
what words were these breaths nothing more these breaths sufficed to
trouble and to touch all nature round about magic power which we
should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these
conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke
wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves take from those murmurs of two
lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies
them like a lyre and what remains is nothing more than a shade you
say what is that all eh yes childish prattle repetitions
laughter at nothing nonsense everything that is deepest and most
sublime in the world the only things which are worth the trouble of
the man who has never heard the man who has never uttered these
absurdities these paltry remarks is an imbecile and a malicious
in all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness and without either
of them being able to say how it had come about they had begun to call
oh cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when i was
a little thing but my real name is euphrasie dost thou like that
then i like it better too truly it is pretty cosette call me
and the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a
grove situated in heaven on another occasion she gazed intently at him
monsieur you are handsome you are good looking you are witty you
are not at all stupid you are much more learned than i am but i bid
you defiance with this word i love you
and marius in the very heavens thought he heard a strain sung by a
or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed and she said to
dont cough sir i will not have people cough on my domain without my
permission its very naughty to cough and to disturb me i want you to
be well because in the first place if you were not well i should be
just imagine i thought at one time that your name was ursule
this made both of them laugh the whole evening
in the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim
oh one day at the luxembourg i had a good mind to finish breaking
up a veteran but he stopped short and went no further he would have
been obliged to speak to cosette of her garter and that was impossible
this bordered on a strange theme the flesh before which that immense
and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright
marius pictured life with cosette to himself like this without anything
else to come every evening to the rue plumet to displace the old and
accommodating bar of the chief justices gate to sit elbow to elbow
on that bench to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the
on coming night to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the
ample fall of cosettes gown to caress her thumb nail to call her
thou to smell of the same flower one after the other forever
indefinitely during this time clouds passed above their heads every
time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than
this chaste almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry by any means
to pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of
bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries it a compliment
is something like a kiss through a veil voluptuousness mingles there
with its sweet tiny point while it hides itself the heart draws back
before voluptuousness only to love the more marius blandishments all
saturated with fancy were so to speak of azure hue the birds when
they fly up yonder in the direction of the angels must hear such
words there were mingled with them nevertheless life humanity all
the positiveness of which marius was capable it was what is said in
the bower a prelude to what will be said in the chamber a lyrical
effusion strophe and sonnet intermingled pleasing hyperboles of
cooing all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and
exhaling a celestial perfume an ineffable twitter of heart to heart
oh murmured marius how beautiful you are i dare not look at you
it is all over with me when i contemplate you you are a grace i know
not what is the matter with me the hem of your gown when the tip of
your shoe peeps from beneath upsets me and then what an enchanted
gleam when you open your thought even but a little you talk
astonishingly good sense it seems to me at times that you are a
dream speak i listen i admire oh cosette how strange it is and how
charming i am really beside myself you are adorable mademoiselle i
study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope
i have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since
questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue which
always turned with mutual consent upon love as the little pith figures
whiteness candor radiance it might have been said of cosette that she
was clear she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april
and dawn there was dew in her eyes cosette was a condensation of the
auroral light in the form of a woman
it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her
but the truth is that this little school girl fresh from the convent
talked with exquisite penetration and uttered at times all sorts of
true and delicate sayings her prattle was conversation she never made
a mistake about anything and she saw things justly the woman feels and
speaks with the tender instinct of the heart which is infallible
no one understands so well as a woman how to say things that are at
once both sweet and deep sweetness and depth they are the whole of
woman in them lies the whole of heaven
in this full felicity tears welled up to their eyes every instant a
crushed lady bug a feather fallen from a nest a branch of hawthorn
broken aroused their pity and their ecstasy sweetly mingled with
melancholy seemed to ask nothing better than to weep the most
sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is at times almost
and in addition to this all these contradictions are the lightning
play of love they were fond of laughing they laughed readily and with
a delicious freedom and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the
still though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity nature is
always present and will not be forgotten she is there with her brutal
and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls one
feels in the most modest private interview the adorable and mysterious
shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends
the permanent and the immutable are persistent people live they smile
they laugh they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips they
interlace their fingers they call each other thou and that does not
two lovers hide themselves in the evening in the twilight in the
invisible with the birds with the roses they fascinate each other in
the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes they
murmur they whisper and in the meantime immense librations of the
they existed vaguely frightened at their happiness they did not notice
the cholera which decimated paris precisely during that very month they
had confided in each other as far as possible but this had not extended
much further than their names marius had told cosette that he was an
orphan that his name was marius pontmercy that he was a lawyer that
he lived by writing things for publishers that his father had been a
colonel that the latter had been a hero and that he marius was on
bad terms with his grandfather who was rich he had also hinted at being
a baron but this had produced no effect on cosette she did not
know the meaning of the word marius was marius on her side she
had confided to him that she had been brought up at the petit picpus
convent that her mother like his own was dead that her fathers name
was m fauchelevent that he was very good that he gave a great deal
to the poor but that he was poor himself and that he denied himself
strange to say in the sort of symphony which marius had lived since he
had been in the habit of seeing cosette the past even the most recent
past had become so confused and distant to him that what cosette told
him satisfied him completely it did not even occur to him to tell her
about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel about thenardier about the
burn and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father
marius had momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not
even know that there had been a morning what he had done where he had
breakfasted nor who had spoken to him he had songs in his ears which
rendered him deaf to every other thought he only existed at the hours
when he saw cosette then as he was in heaven it was quite natural
that he should forget earth both bore languidly the indefinable burden
of immaterial pleasures thus lived these somnambulists who are called
alas who is there who has not felt all these things why does there
come an hour when one emerges from this azure and why does life go on
loving almost takes the place of thinking love is an ardent
forgetfulness of all the rest then ask logic of passion if you will
there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there
is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism for cosette
and marius nothing existed except marius and cosette the universe
around them had fallen into a hole they lived in a golden minute there
was nothing before them nothing behind it hardly occurred to marius
that cosette had a father his brain was dazzled and obliterated of
what did these lovers talk then we have seen of the flowers and
the swallows the setting sun and the rising moon and all sorts of
important things they had told each other everything except everything
the everything of lovers is nothing but the father the realities that
lair the ruffians that adventure to what purpose and was he very
sure that this nightmare had actually existed they were two and they
adored each other and beyond that there was nothing nothing else
existed it is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is
inherent to the arrival of paradise have we beheld demons are there
any have we trembled have we suffered we no longer know a rosy cloud
so these two beings lived in this manner high aloft with all that
improbability which is in nature neither at the nadir nor at the
zenith between man and seraphim above the mire below the ether in
the clouds hardly flesh and blood soul and ecstasy from head to foot
already too sublime to walk the earth still too heavily charged with
humanity to disappear in the blue suspended like atoms which are
waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the bounds of destiny
ignorant of that rut yesterday to day to morrow amazed rapturous
floating soaring at times so light that they could take their flight
out into the infinite almost prepared to soar away to all eternity
they slept wide awake thus sweetly lulled oh splendid lethargy of the
sometimes beautiful as cosette was marius shut his eyes in her
presence the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes
marius and cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them
they considered that they had already arrived it is a strange claim on
mans part to wish that love should lead to something
cosette who was rather less dreamy than marius was gay and that
sufficed for jean valjeans happiness the thoughts which cosette
cherished her tender preoccupations marius image which filled her
heart took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful
chaste and smiling brow she was at the age when the virgin bears her
love as the angel his lily so jean valjean was at ease and then when
two lovers have come to an understanding things always go well the
third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect
blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the
same in the case of all lovers thus cosette never objected to any of
jean valjeans proposals did she want to take a walk yes dear little
father did she want to stay at home very good did he wish to pass
the evening with cosette she was delighted as he always went to bed at
ten oclock marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until
after that hour when from the street he heard cosette open the long
glass door on the veranda of course no one ever met marius in the
daytime jean valjean never even dreamed any longer that marius was in
existence only once one morning he chanced to say to cosette why
you have whitewash on your back on the previous evening marius in a
old toussaint who retired early thought of nothing but her sleep and
was as ignorant of the whole matter as jean valjean
marius never set foot in the house when he was with cosette they hid
themselves in a recess near the steps in order that they might neither
be seen nor heard from the street and there they sat frequently
contenting themselves by way of conversation with pressing each
others hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the
trees at such times a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from
them and they would not have noticed it so deeply was the revery of
the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other
limpid purity hours wholly white almost all alike this sort of love
is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove
the whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street every
time that marius entered and left he carefully adjusted the bar of the
gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible
he usually went away about midnight and returned to courfeyracs
would you believe it marius comes home nowadays at one oclock in the
what do you expect theres always a petard in a seminary fellow
at times courfeyrac folded his arms assumed a serious air and said to
you are getting irregular in your habits young man
courfeyrac being a practical man did not take in good part this
reflection of an invisible paradise upon marius he was not much in the
habit of concealed passions it made him impatient and now and then he
called upon marius to come back to reality
my dear fellow you produce upon me the effect of being located in
the moon the realm of dreams the province of illusions capital
soap bubble come be a good boy whats her name
but nothing could induce marius to talk they might have torn out his
nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable
name cosette was composed true love is as luminous as the dawn and as
silent as the tomb only courfeyrac saw this change in marius that his
during this sweet month of may marius and cosette learned to know these
immense delights to dispute and to say you for thou simply that they
might say thou the better afterwards to talk at great length with very
minute details of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest
in the world another proof that in that ravishing opera called love
for marius to listen to cosette discussing finery
for cosette to listen to marius talk in politics
to listen knee pressed to knee to the carriages rolling along the rue
to gaze upon the same planet in space or at the same glowworm gleaming
to hold their peace together a still greater delight than conversation
one evening marius was on his way to the rendezvous by way of the
boulevard des invalides he habitually walked with drooping head as he
was on the point of turning the corner of the rue plumet he heard some
this produced a singular effect upon him he had not thought of that
girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue
plumet he had not seen her again and she had gone completely out of
his mind he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her he
owed her his happiness and yet it was embarrassing to him to meet her
it is an error to think that passion when it is pure and happy leads
man to a state of perfection it simply leads him as we have noted to
a state of oblivion in this situation man forgets to be bad but
he also forgets to be good gratitude duty matters essential and
important to be remembered vanish at any other time marius would have
behaved quite differently to eponine absorbed in cosette he had not
even clearly put it to himself that this eponine was named eponine
thenardier and that she bore the name inscribed in his fathers will
that name for which but a few months before he would have so ardently
sacrificed himself we show marius as he was his father himself was
fading out of his soul to some extent under the splendor of his love
why do you call me you have i done anything to you
certainly he had nothing against her far from it only he felt that
he could not do otherwise now that he used thou to cosette than say
then she paused it seemed as though words failed that creature formerly
so heedless and so bold she tried to smile and could not then she
then she paused again and remained with downcast eyes
good evening mr marius said she suddenly and abruptly and away she
chapter iv a cab runs in english and barks in slang
the following day was the 3d of june 1832 a date which it is necessary
to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on
the horizon of paris in the state of lightning charged clouds marius
at nightfall was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening
with the same thoughts of delight in his heart when he caught sight
of eponine approaching through the trees of the boulevard two days
in succession this was too much he turned hastily aside quitted the
boulevard changed his course and went to the rue plumet through the rue
this caused eponine to follow him to the rue plumet a thing which
she had not yet done up to that time she had contented herself with
watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to
encounter him it was only on the evening before that she had attempted
so eponine followed him without his suspecting the fact she saw him
displace the bar and slip into the garden
she approached the railing felt of the bars one after the other and
readily recognized the one which marius had moved
she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents
she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the
bar as though she were guarding it it was precisely at the point where
the railing touched the neighboring wall there was a dim nook there in
she remained thus for more than an hour without stirring and without
towards ten oclock in the evening one of the two or three persons who
passed through the rue plumet an old belated bourgeois who was making
haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute as he skirted
the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall
im no longer surprised that he comes here every evening
the passer by cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into
the black niche and was greatly alarmed he redoubled his pace
this passer by had reason to make haste for a very few instants later
six men who were marching separately and at some distance from each
other along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol
the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the
others a second later all six were reunited
these men began to talk in a low voice
this is the place said one of them
is there a cab dog in the garden asked another
i dont know in any case i have fetched a ball that well make him
have you some putty to break the pane with
the railing is old interpolated a fifth who had the voice of a
so much the better said the second who had spoken it wont screech
under the saw and it wont be hard to cut
the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect
the gate as eponine had done an hour earlier grasping each bar in
thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened as he was on the
point of grasping this bar a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness
fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push
in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not
at the same moment he perceived a pale girl standing before him
the man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings he
bristled up in hideous wise nothing is so formidable to behold as
ferocious beasts who are uneasy their terrified air evokes terror
