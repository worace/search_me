since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be
assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed
from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our
surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am
very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing
to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step
and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is
disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing
our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how
thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against
him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about
twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have
passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of
their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor
mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing
what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i
wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my
head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest
lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you
and it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham
and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the
day before not many hours after the express though lydias short
letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was
repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b
intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham
but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney
coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that
is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road
i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that
side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but
without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with
the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved
for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our
distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the
worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a
young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose
her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that
colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his
head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to
be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she
exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and
as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of
confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the
first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not
so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i
take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but
circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well
that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something
more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel
forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure
i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to
be at brighton again to morrow evening in such an exigence my
uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will
immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness
oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat
as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing
a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak
she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation
hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find
mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than
politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute
but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back
the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and
looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her
or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration
let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there
is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could
not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say
something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate
silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane
with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my younger
sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into
the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton
you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no
connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever
darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet
more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what
he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i
learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not
have happened but it is all all too late now
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked but is it
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced
almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles
immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but
nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is
such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have
not the smallest hope it is every way horrible
when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what
i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too
darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air
gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her
power was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of family
weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither
wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it
was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him as now when all love must be vain
but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydia the
humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed
up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of
several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke
compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my
stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i
fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley
oh yes be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy say that
urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible i know it cannot be long
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for
her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full
of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if
otherwise if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object and even before two words have been
exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham
and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him
go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must
produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained
a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought
could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development while the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose
lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that
lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one
officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions
raised them in her opinion her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how acutely did she now
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a
family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost
importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe mr
and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them
instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a
favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner promised every
assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked
him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to
be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley
cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement
what is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to
prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth oh that i knew how it was
but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their
sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing
remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of
the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they
drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends
would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is
do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles
opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and
interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of
wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other
neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i
dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof
oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the
well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though
for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it
might strike them that they could be more economically though less
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their
marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular
friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he
cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attraction has she
beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your
other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has
no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers
behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would
do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in
but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with
tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say
perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year
nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love
flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give
greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are
naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be
their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt
till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what
wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating
and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at
longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to
relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud
reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you
oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw
so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was
ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the
case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could
it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was
settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a
consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i
suppose to believe them fond of each other
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all
were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular
attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment
who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during
the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night
on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the
carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of
capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss
hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the
eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word
we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i
particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention
and my mother how is she how are you all
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly
shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank
but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their
conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were
engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and
thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears
when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of
good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that
every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father
to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes
conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing
if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton
with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child
and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become
of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be
prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain
it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married
and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as
lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make
him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i
could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out
wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them
marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them
after they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fighting
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my
wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such
spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that
i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does
not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well
in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to
oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it
better that one only of the household and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the
faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible
in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance
of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added
unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one
false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed
to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for
half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued
the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which
i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel
forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place they must have seen them together for ever
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so
grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he
was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of
their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself
yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of
their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a
doubt i suppose of their being really married
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt
a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him
in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter
she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their
being in love with each other many weeks
and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself does
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad
affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his
he brought it with him for us to see
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth these
you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am
missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who
i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i
love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think
it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my
going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater
when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke
it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to
pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will
dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall
send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell
sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had
finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment
but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their
journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her
side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it
i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so
much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen
your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look
well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every
fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbourn
on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and
lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she
meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see
too little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence
insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where
they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come
with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he
determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone
and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next
morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could
to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also
visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of
cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months
before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above
half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less
of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come
when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely
despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a
letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival
but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first
coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was
eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised
to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if
possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have
nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never
heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both
of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of
his companions in the shire might be able to give more information
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters
was the grand object of every mornings impatience through letters
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for
their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence
she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his
letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation
in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in
your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that
may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to
be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte
informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time
for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be
you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined
by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to
whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says
will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event
of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir to
console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one
living his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he
had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the
wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton
he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more
formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester
she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded
to his brother in laws entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he
will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham
and make him marry her if he comes away
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she
and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet
came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their
journey and brought its master back to longbourn
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and
the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their
being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from pemberley
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be
fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware
that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of
lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him
away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say
nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone
to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression
do you suppose them to be in london
yes where else can they be so well concealed
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there
lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me
last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers
this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such an
elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my
library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as
i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should
ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne
for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and
you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter into
my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be
absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good
girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons
when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon
madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here
this half hour and master has had a letter
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the
library their father was in neither and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the
if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once
more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath
came up with him and eagerly cried out
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
yes i have had a letter from him by express
well and what news does it bring good or bad
what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from
his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as
upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction soon after you
left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough
to know they are discovered i have seen them both 
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married
i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there
was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will
not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure
to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her
during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions
which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with
as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by
express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you
will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be
