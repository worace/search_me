and this was encompassed with much bitterness he had calculated that
his earnings during his sojourn in the galleys ought to amount to
a hundred and seventy one francs it is but just to add that he had
forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays
and festival days during nineteen years which entailed a diminution
of about eighty francs at all events his hoard had been reduced by
various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen
sous which had been counted out to him on his departure he had
understood nothing of this and had thought himself wronged let us say
on the day following his liberation he saw at grasse in front of
an orange flower distillery some men engaged in unloading bales he
offered his services business was pressing they were accepted he set
to work he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best the master
seemed pleased while he was at work a gendarme passed observed
him and demanded his papers it was necessary to show him the yellow
passport that done jean valjean resumed his labor a little while
before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they
earned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous when
evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day
he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be
paid the owner did not utter a word but handed him twenty five sous he
objected he was told that is enough for thee he persisted the
master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of
there again he considered that he had been robbed
society the state by diminishing his hoard had robbed him wholesale
now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail
liberation is not deliverance one gets free from the galleys but not
that is what happened to him at grasse we have seen in what manner he
as the cathedral clock struck two in the morning jean valjean awoke
what woke him was that his bed was too good it was nearly twenty years
since he had slept in a bed and although he had not undressed the
sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers
he had slept more than four hours his fatigue had passed away he was
accustomed not to devote many hours to repose
he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him then
he closed them again with the intention of going to sleep once more
when many varied sensations have agitated the day when various matters
preoccupy the mind one falls asleep once but not a second time
sleep comes more easily than it returns this is what happened to jean
valjean he could not get to sleep again and he fell to thinking
he was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in ones
mind are troubled there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain his
memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there
pell mell and mingled confusedly losing their proper forms becoming
disproportionately large then suddenly disappearing as in a muddy and
perturbed pool many thoughts occurred to him but there was one which
kept constantly presenting itself afresh and which drove away all
others we will mention this thought at once he had observed the six
sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which madame magloire had
those six sets of silver haunted him they were there a few paces
distant just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the
one in which he then was the old servant woman had been in the act
of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed he had
taken careful note of this cupboard on the right as you entered from
the dining room they were solid and old silver from the ladle one
could get at least two hundred francs double what he had earned in
nineteen years it is true that he would have earned more if the
his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was
certainly mingled some struggle three oclock struck he opened his
eyes again drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture stretched
out his arm and felt of his knapsack which he had thrown down on a
corner of the alcove then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed
and placed his feet on the floor and thus found himself almost without
he remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude which would have
been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him
thus in the dark the only person awake in that house where all were
sleeping all of a sudden he stooped down removed his shoes and placed
them softly on the mat beside the bed then he resumed his thoughtful
throughout this hideous meditation the thoughts which we have above
indicated moved incessantly through his brain entered withdrew
re entered and in a manner oppressed him and then he thought also
without knowing why and with the mechanical persistence of revery of
a convict named brevet whom he had known in the galleys and whose
trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton the
checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind
he remained in this situation and would have so remained indefinitely
even until daybreak had not the clock struck one the half or quarter
hour it seemed to him that that stroke said to him come on
he rose to his feet hesitated still another moment and listened all
was quiet in the house then he walked straight ahead with short steps
to the window of which he caught a glimpse the night was not very
dark there was a full moon across which coursed large clouds driven by
the wind this created outdoors alternate shadow and gleams of light
eclipses then bright openings of the clouds and indoors a sort of
twilight this twilight sufficient to enable a person to see his way
intermittent on account of the clouds resembled the sort of livid light
which falls through an air hole in a cellar before which the passersby
come and go on arriving at the window jean valjean examined it it had
no grating it opened in the garden and was fastened according to the
fashion of the country only by a small pin he opened it but as a
rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly he closed
it again immediately he scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze
which studies rather than looks the garden was enclosed by a tolerably
low white wall easy to climb far away at the extremity he perceived
tops of trees spaced at regular intervals which indicated that the
wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees
having taken this survey he executed a movement like that of a man who
has made up his mind strode to his alcove grasped his knapsack opened
it fumbled in it pulled out of it something which he placed on the
bed put his shoes into one of his pockets shut the whole thing up
again threw the knapsack on his shoulders put on his cap drew the
visor down over his eyes felt for his cudgel went and placed it in the
angle of the window then returned to the bed and resolutely seized the
object which he had deposited there it resembled a short bar of
iron pointed like a pike at one end it would have been difficult to
distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could
have been designed perhaps it was a lever possibly it was a club
in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing
more than a miners candlestick convicts were at that period
sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ
toulon and it was not rare for them to have miners tools at their
command these miners candlesticks are of massive iron terminated at
the lower extremity by a point by means of which they are stuck into
he took the candlestick in his right hand holding his breath and trying
to deaden the sound of his tread he directed his steps to the door of
the adjoining room occupied by the bishop as we already know
on arriving at this door he found it ajar the bishop had not closed
he pushed it gently with the tip of his finger lightly with the
furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering
the door yielded to this pressure and made an imperceptible and silent
he waited a moment then gave the door a second and a bolder push
it continued to yield in silence the opening was now large enough to
allow him to pass but near the door there stood a little table which
formed an embarrassing angle with it and barred the entrance
jean valjean recognized the difficulty it was necessary at any cost
he decided on his course of action and gave the door a third push more
energetic than the two preceding this time a badly oiled hinge suddenly
emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry
jean valjean shuddered the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with
something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day
in the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined
that that hinge had just become animated and had suddenly assumed a
terrible life and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one
and warn and to wake those who were asleep he halted shuddering
bewildered and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels he
heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers and
it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar
of the wind issuing from a cavern it seemed impossible to him that the
horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the
entire household like the shock of an earthquake the door pushed by
him had taken the alarm and had shouted the old man would rise at
once the two old women would shriek out people would come to their
assistance in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an
uproar and the gendarmerie on hand for a moment he thought himself
he remained where he was petrified like the statue of salt not daring
to make a movement several minutes elapsed the door had fallen wide
open he ventured to peep into the next room nothing had stirred there
he lent an ear nothing was moving in the house the noise made by the
this first danger was past but there still reigned a frightful tumult
within him nevertheless he did not retreat even when he had thought
himself lost he had not drawn back his only thought now was to finish
as soon as possible he took a step and entered the room
this room was in a state of perfect calm here and there vague and
confused forms were distinguishable which in the daylight were papers
scattered on a table open folios volumes piled upon a stool an
arm chair heaped with clothing a prie dieu and which at that hour
were only shadowy corners and whitish spots jean valjean advanced with
precaution taking care not to knock against the furniture he could
hear at the extremity of the room the even and tranquil breathing of
he suddenly came to a halt he was near the bed he had arrived there
nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions
with sombre and intelligent appropriateness as though she desired to
make us reflect for the last half hour a large cloud had covered the
heavens at the moment when jean valjean paused in front of the bed
this cloud parted as though on purpose and a ray of light traversing
the long window suddenly illuminated the bishops pale face he was
sleeping peacefully he lay in his bed almost completely dressed on
account of the cold of the basses alps in a garment of brown wool
which covered his arms to the wrists his head was thrown back on the
pillow in the careless attitude of repose his hand adorned with the
pastoral ring and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many
holy actions was hanging over the edge of the bed his whole face
was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction of hope and of
felicity it was more than a smile and almost a radiance he bore upon
his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible
the soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven
a reflection of that heaven rested on the bishop
it was at the same time a luminous transparency for that heaven was
at the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself so to speak
upon that inward radiance the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory it
remained however gentle and veiled in an ineffable half light that
moon in the sky that slumbering nature that garden without a quiver
that house which was so calm the hour the moment the silence added
some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man
and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white
hair those closed eyes that face in which all was hope and all was
confidence that head of an old man and that slumber of an infant
there was something almost divine in this man who was thus august
jean valjean was in the shadow and stood motionless with his iron
candlestick in his hand frightened by this luminous old man never had
he beheld anything like this this confidence terrified him the
moral world has no grander spectacle than this a troubled and
uneasy conscience which has arrived on the brink of an evil action
that slumber in that isolation and with a neighbor like himself had
about it something sublime of which he was vaguely but imperiously
no one could have told what was passing within him not even himself in
order to attempt to form an idea of it it is necessary to think of the
most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle even on
his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with
certainty it was a sort of haggard astonishment he gazed at it and
that was all but what was his thought it would have been impossible to
divine it what was evident was that he was touched and astounded but
his eye never quitted the old man the only thing which was clearly
to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange
indecision one would have said that he was hesitating between the two
abysses the one in which one loses ones self and that in which one
saves ones self he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that
at the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards
his brow and he took off his cap then his arm fell back with the same
deliberation and jean valjean fell to meditating once more his cap in
his left hand his club in his right hand his hair bristling all over
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying
the gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the
chimney piece which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them
with a benediction for one and pardon for the other
suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow then stepped rapidly
past the bed without glancing at the bishop straight to the cupboard
which he saw near the head he raised his iron candlestick as though to
force the lock the key was there he opened it the first thing which
presented itself to him was the basket of silverware he seized it
traversed the chamber with long strides without taking any precautions
and without troubling himself about the noise gained the door
re entered the oratory opened the window seized his cudgel bestrode
the window sill of the ground floor put the silver into his knapsack
threw away the basket crossed the garden leaped over the wall like a
the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his
garden madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation
monseigneur monseigneur she exclaimed does your grace know where
jesus the lord be blessed she resumed i did not know what had
the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed he presented
well said she nothing in it and the silver
ah returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you i
great good god it is stolen that man who was here last night has
in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame
magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned
to the bishop the bishop had just bent down and was sighing as he
examined a plant of cochlearia des guillons which the basket had broken
as it fell across the bed he rose up at madame magloires cry
monseigneur the man is gone the silver has been stolen
as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the
garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible the
coping of the wall had been torn away
stay yonder is the way he went he jumped over into cochefilet lane
ah the abomination he has stolen our silver
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes
and in the first place was that silver ours
madame magloire was speechless another silence ensued then the bishop
madame magloire i have for a long time detained that silver
wrongfully it belonged to the poor who was that man a poor man
alas jesus returned madame magloire it is not for my sake nor for
mademoiselles it makes no difference to us but it is for the sake of
monseigneur what is monseigneur to eat with now
the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement
ah come are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons
very well said the bishop wooden ones then
a few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which
jean valjean had sat on the previous evening as he ate his breakfast
monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister who said nothing and
to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really
does not need either fork or spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit
a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and
came to take in a man like that and to lodge him close to ones self
and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal ah mon dieu it makes
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came
the door opened a singular and violent group made its appearance on the
threshold three men were holding a fourth man by the collar the three
men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean
a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was
standing near the door he entered and advanced to the bishop making a
at this word jean valjean who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed
raised his head with an air of stupefaction
monseigneur he murmured so he is not the cure
silence said the gendarme he is monseigneur the bishop
in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his
ah here you are he exclaimed looking at jean valjean i am glad to
see you well but how is this i gave you the candlesticks too which
are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two
hundred francs why did you not carry them away with your forks and
jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop
with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of
monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said
is true then we came across him he was walking like a man who is
running away we stopped him to look into the matter he had this
and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been
given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed
the night i see how the matter stands and you have brought him back
in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go
is it true that i am to be released he said in an almost
inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep
yes thou art released dost thou not understand said one of the
my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your
he stepped to the chimney piece took the two silver candlesticks and
brought them to jean valjean the two women looked on without uttering
a word without a gesture without a look which could disconcert the
jean valjean was trembling in every limb he took the two candlesticks
now said the bishop go in peace by the way when you return my
friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden you can always
enter and depart through the street door it is never fastened with
anything but a latch either by day or by night
jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting
the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice
do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money
jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything
remained speechless the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered
jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good it
is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and
the spirit of perdition and i give it to god
jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it he set out
at a very hasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths
presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly
retracing his steps he wandered thus the whole morning without having
eaten anything and without feeling hungry he was the prey of a throng
of novel sensations he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not
know against whom it was directed he could not have told whether he was
touched or humiliated there came over him at moments a strange emotion
which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during
the last twenty years of his life this state of mind fatigued him
he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the
injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within
him he asked himself what would replace this at times he would have
actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things
should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less
although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few
late flowers in the hedge rows here and there whose odor as he passed
through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood
these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since they
unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long
as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the
soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large
ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted there was nothing on the
horizon except the alps not even the spire of a distant village jean
valjean might have been three leagues distant from d a path which
intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush
in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not
a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have
he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age
coming up the path and singing his hurdy gurdy on his hip and his
one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording
a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers
without stopping his song the lad halted in his march from time to
time and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his
among this money there was one forty sou piece
the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and
tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught
with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand
this time the forty sou piece escaped him and went rolling towards the
in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught
he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man
the spot was absolutely solitary as far as the eye could see there was
not a person on the plain or on the path the only sound was the tiny
feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the
heavens at an immense height the child was standing with his back to
the sun which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its
blood red gleam the savage face of jean valjean
sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is
sir resumed the child give me back my money
jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply
jean valjeans eyes remained fixed on the earth
my piece of money cried the child my white piece my silver
it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him the child grasped him
by the collar of his blouse and shook him at the same time he made an
effort to displace the big iron shod shoe which rested on his treasure
i want my piece of money my piece of forty sous
the child wept jean valjean raised his head he still remained seated
his eyes were troubled he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement
then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a
i sir replied the child little gervais i give me back my forty
sous if you please take your foot away sir if you please
then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing
come now will you take your foot away take your foot away or well
ah its still you said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his
feet his foot still resting on the silver piece he added
the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to
foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top
of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry
nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain
distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own
at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared
the shadows were descending around jean valjean he had eaten nothing
all day it is probable that he was feverish
he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the
childs flight the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular
intervals his gaze fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him seemed
to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient
fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass all at once
he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening
he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to
cross and button his blouse advanced a step and stopped to pick up his
at that moment he caught sight of the forty sou piece which his foot
had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles
it was as though he had received a galvanic shock what is this
he muttered between his teeth he recoiled three paces then halted
without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had
trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering
there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him
at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the
silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to
gaze afar off over the plain at the same time casting his eyes towards
all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a
he saw nothing night was falling the plain was cold and vague great
banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight
he said ah and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child
had disappeared after about thirty paces he paused looked about him
the landscape was gloomy and deserted he was encompassed by space
there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was
lost and a silence which engulfed his voice
an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a
sort of lugubrious life the bushes shook their thin little arms with
incredible fury one would have said that they were threatening and
he set out on his march again then he began to run and from time to
time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was
the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to
assuredly if the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and
would have taken good care not to show himself but the child was no
he encountered a priest on horseback he stepped up to him and said
monsieur le cure have you seen a child pass
he drew two five franc pieces from his money bag and handed them to the
monsieur le cure this is for your poor people monsieur le cure he
was a little lad about ten years old with a marmot i think and a
hurdy gurdy one of those savoyards you know
little gervais there are no villages here can you tell me
if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger such
persons pass through these parts we know nothing of them
jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence
monsieur labbe have me arrested i am a thief
the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste much alarmed
jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first
in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling
shouting but he met no one two or three times he ran across the plain
towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being
reclining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood
or rocks nearly on a level with the earth at length at a spot where
three paths intersected each other he stopped the moon had risen he
sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little
gervais little gervais little gervais his shout died away in the
mist without even awakening an echo he murmured yet once more little
gervais but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice it was his last
effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible
power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil
conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in
his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch
then his heart burst and he began to cry it was the first time that he
when jean valjean left the bishops house he was as we have seen
quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto he
could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him he
hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the
old man you have promised me to become an honest man i buy your soul
i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the good
this recurred to his mind unceasingly to this celestial kindness
he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us he was
indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest
assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his
obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he
yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the
actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and
which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be
conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle had been
begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man
in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is
intoxicated as he walked thus with haggard eyes did he have a distinct
perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d  did
he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the
spirit at certain moments of life did a voice whisper in his ear that
he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer
remained a middle course for him that if he were not henceforth the
best of men he would be the worst that it behooved him now so to
speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict
that if he wished to become good be must become an angel that if he
wished to remain evil he must become a monster
here again some questions must be put which we have already put
to ourselves elsewhere did he catch some shadow of all this in his
thought in a confused way misfortune certainly as we have said does
form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful
whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have
here indicated if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses
of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into
an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion on emerging from
that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop
had hurt his soul as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on
emerging from the dark the future life the possible life which offered
itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors
and anxiety he no longer knew where he really was like an owl who
should suddenly see the sun rise the convict had been dazzled and
that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no
longer the same man that everything about him was changed that it was
no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to
in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed
him of his forty sous why he certainly could not have explained it
was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the
evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of
impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force it
was that and it was also perhaps even less than that let us say it
simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast
who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money
while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto
when intelligence re awakened and beheld that action of the brute jean
valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror
it was because strange phenomenon and one which was possible only
in the situation in which he found himself in stealing the money from
that child he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable
however that may be this last evil action had a decisive effect on
him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and
dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other
the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as
certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating
first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all
bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the
child in order to return his money to him then when he recognized the
fact that this was impossible he halted in despair at the moment when
he exclaimed i am a wretch he had just perceived what he was and he
was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to
himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom and as if he had
there before him in flesh and blood the hideous galley convict jean
valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled
with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage
excess of unhappiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort
a visionary this then was in the nature of a vision he actually saw
that jean valjean that sinister face before him he had almost reached
the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by
his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm
moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality one no
longer beholds the object which one has before one and one sees as
though apart from ones self the figures which one has in ones own
thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same
time athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depth a
sort of light which he at first took for a torch on scrutinizing
this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he
recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch
his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the
bishop and jean valjean nothing less than the first was required to
soften the second by one of those singular effects which are peculiar
to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his revery continued as the
bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow
less and vanish after a certain time he was no longer anything more
than a shade all at once he disappeared the bishop alone remained he
filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance
jean valjean wept for a long time he wept burning tears he sobbed with
more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child
as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an
extraordinary light a light at once ravishing and terrible his past
life his first fault his long expiation his external brutishness his
internal hardness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans
of vengeance what had happened to him at the bishops the last thing
that he had done that theft of forty sous from a child a crime all the
more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the
bishops pardon all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly
to him but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed
he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it
seemed frightful to him in the meantime a gentle light rested over this
