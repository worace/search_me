so long as there shall exist by virtue of law and custom decrees of

destiny so long as the three great problems of the century the
degradation of man through pauperism the corruption of woman through
hunger the crippling of children through lack of light are unsolved
so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world in
other words and with a still wider significance so long as ignorance

in 1815 m charles francois bienvenu myriel was bishop of d he was
an old man of about seventy five years of age he had occupied the see
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance
of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous if merely
for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various
rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very
moment when he arrived in the diocese true or false that which is said
of men often occupies as important a place in their lives and above all
in their destinies as that which they do m myriel was the son of a
councillor of the parliament of aix hence he belonged to the nobility
of the bar it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of
his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty
in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in
parliamentary families in spite of this marriage however it was said
that charles myriel created a great deal of talk he was well formed
though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the
whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and
the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the
parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m charles myriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the
revolution there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she
had long suffered he had no children what took place next in the fate
of m myriel the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall
of his own family the tragic spectacles of 93 which were perhaps
even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance
with the magnifying powers of terror did these cause the ideas of
renunciation and solitude to germinate in him was he in the midst of
these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly
smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes
overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes
would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune no one
could have told all that was known was that when he returned from
in 1804 m myriel was the cure of b brignolles he was already
advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with
his curacy just what is not precisely known took him to paris
among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his
parishioners was m le cardinal fesch one day when the emperor
had come to visit his uncle the worthy cure who was waiting in the
anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed napoleon
on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man
who is this good man who is staring at me
sire said m myriel you are looking at a good man and i at a great
man each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure
and some time afterwards m myriel was utterly astonished to learn that
what truth was there after all in the stories which were invented as
to the early portion of m myriels life no one knew very few families
had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution
m myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town
where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because
he was a bishop but after all the rumors with which his name
was connected were rumors only noise sayings words less than
words palabres as the energetic language of the south expresses it
however that may be after nine years of episcopal power and of
residence in d  all the stories and subjects of conversation which
engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into
profound oblivion no one would have dared to mention them no one would
m myriel had arrived at d accompanied by an elderly spinster
mademoiselle baptistine who was his sister and ten years his junior
their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle
baptistine and named madame magloire who after having been the
servant of m le cure now assumed the double title of maid to
mademoiselle baptistine was a long pale thin gentle creature she
realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems
that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable she
had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a
succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of
pallor and transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired
what may be called the beauty of goodness what had been leanness in
her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity
allowed the angel to be seen she was a soul rather than a virgin her
person seemed made of a shadow there was hardly sufficient body to
provide for sex a little matter enclosing a light large eyes forever
drooping a mere pretext for a souls remaining on the earth
madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and
bustling always out of breath in the first place because of her
activity and in the next because of her asthma
on his arrival m myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with
the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop
immediately after a major general the mayor and the president paid the
first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general
the installation over the town waited to see its bishop at work
the episcopal palace of d adjoins the hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at
the beginning of the last century by m henri puget doctor of theology
of the faculty of paris abbe of simore who had been bishop of d in
1712 this palace was a genuine seignorial residence everything about
it had a grand air the apartments of the bishop the drawing rooms
the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks
encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens
planted with magnificent trees in the dining room a long and superb
gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the
gardens m henri puget had entertained in state on july 29 1714 my
lords charles brulart de genlis archbishop prince dembrun antoine
de mesgrigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand
prior of france abbe of saint honore de lerins francois de berton de
crillon bishop baron de vence cesar de sabran de forcalquier bishop
seignor of glandeve and jean soanen priest of the oratory preacher in
ordinary to the king bishop seignor of senez the portraits of these
seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable
date the 29th of july 1714 was there engraved in letters of gold on a
the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital the visit
ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his
monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick
that was the number which i counted said the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each
the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air
and then when there is a ray of sun the garden is very small for the
in case of epidemics we have had the typhus fever this year we
had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at
that is the thought which occurred to me
what would you have monseigneur said the director one must resign
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the
monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking
it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to
hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something
there is evidently a mistake here there are thirty six of you in five
or six small rooms there are three of us here and we have room for
sixty there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have
yours give me back my house you are at home here
on the following day the thirty six patients were installed in the
bishops palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital
m myriel had no property his family having been ruined by the
revolution his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred
francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage m myriel
received from the state in his quality of bishop a salary of fifteen
thousand francs on the very day when he took up his abode in the
hospital m myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for
all in the following manner we transcribe here a note made by his own
note on the regulation of my household expenses
work for the relief and delivery of prisoners    500 
to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 1000 
addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the
congregation of the ladies of d  of manosque and of
m myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period
that he occupied the see of d as has been seen he called it
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle
baptistine this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d as at one and
the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the
flesh and her superior according to the church she simply loved and
venerated him when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her
adherence their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little it
will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself
only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle
baptistine made fifteen hundred francs a year on these fifteen hundred
francs these two old women and the old man subsisted
and when a village curate came to d  the bishop still found means to
entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to
one day after he had been in d about three months the bishop
and still i am quite cramped with it all
i should think so exclaimed madame magloire monseigneur has not
even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense
of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese it was
hold cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
some time afterwards the general council took this demand under
consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs
under this heading allowance to m the bishop for expenses of carriage
expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator
of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred
which favored the 18 brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent
senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d  wrote to m
bigot de preameneu the minister of public worship a very angry and
confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic
expenses of carriage what can be done with it in a town of less than
four thousand inhabitants expenses of journeys what is the use
of these trips in the first place next how can the posting be
accomplished in these mountainous parts there are no roads no one
travels otherwise than on horseback even the bridge between durance and
chateau arnoux can barely support ox teams these priests are all thus
greedy and avaricious this man played the good priest when he
first came now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a
posting chaise he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden
days oh all this priesthood things will not go well m le comte
until the emperor has freed us from these black capped rascals down
with the pope matters were getting embroiled with rome for my part
on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame
magloire good said she to mademoiselle baptistine monseigneur
began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after
all he has regulated all his charities now here are three thousand
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a
for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital 1500 livres
for the maternity charitable society of aix        250 
for the maternity charitable society of draguignan    250 
as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage bans
dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or
chapels marriages etc the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all
the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy
after a time offerings of money flowed in those who had and those who
lacked knocked at m myriels door the latter in search of the alms
which the former came to deposit in less than a year the bishop had
become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those
in distress considerable sums of money passed through his hands but
nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of
life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities
far from it as there is always more wretchedness below than there
is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was
received it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he
received he never had any then he stripped himself
