and to assail the biscayan was the work of an instant determined as he
was to venture all upon a single blow the biscayan seeing him come on
in this way was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing and
resolved to follow his example so he waited for him keeping well under
cover of his cushion being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with
his mule which dead tired and never meant for this kind of game could
on then as aforesaid came don quixote against the wary biscayan with
uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half while on
his side the biscayan waited for him sword in hand and under the
protection of his cushion and all present stood trembling waiting in
suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall and the lady in
the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and
offerings to all the images and shrines of spain that god might deliver
her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found
themselves but it spoils all that at this point and crisis the author
of the history leaves this battle impending giving as excuse that he
could find nothing more written about these achievements of don quixote
than what has been already set forth it is true the second author of
this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have
been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion or that the wits of
la mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their
archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight
and this being his persuasion he did not despair of finding the
conclusion of this pleasant history which heaven favouring him he did
find in a way that shall be related in the second part
in which is concluded and finished the terrific battle between the
in the first part of this history we left the valiant biscayan and the
renowned don quixote with drawn swords uplifted ready to deliver two
such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they
would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid
them open like a pomegranate and at this so critical point the
delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any
intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found
this distressed me greatly because the pleasure derived from having read
such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance
that presented itself of finding the large part that so it seemed to me
was missing of such an interesting tale it appeared to me to be a thing
impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should
have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his
marvellous achievements a thing that was never wanting to any of those
knights errant who they say went after adventures for every one of
them had one or two sages as if made on purpose who not only recorded
their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies
however secret they might be and such a good knight could not have been
so unfortunate as not to have what platir and others like him had in
abundance and so i could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant
tale had been left maimed and mutilated and i laid the blame on time
the devourer and destroyer of all things that had either concealed or
on the other hand it struck me that inasmuch as among his books there
had been found such modern ones as the enlightenment of jealousy and
the nymphs and shepherds of henares his story must likewise be modern
and that though it might not be written it might exist in the memory of
the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood this
reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the
whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous spaniard don quixote of la
mancha light and mirror of manchegan chivalry and the first that in our
age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise
of the arms of knight errantry righting wrongs succouring widows and
protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about whip in hand on
their palfreys with all their virginity about them from mountain to
mountain and valley to valley for if it were not for some ruffian or
boor with a hood and hatchet or monstrous giant that forced them there
were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years in all
which time they had never slept a day under a roof went to their graves
as much maids as the mothers that bore them i say then that in these
and other respects our gallant don quixote is worthy of everlasting and
notable praise nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and
pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history
though i know well that if heaven chance and good fortune had not helped
me the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and
pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall
read it attentively the discovery of it occurred in this way
one day as i was in the alcana of toledo a boy came up to sell some
pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer and as i am fond of reading
even the very scraps of paper in the streets led by this natural bent of
mine i took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale and saw that it
was in characters which i recognised as arabic and as i was unable to
read them though i could recognise them i looked about to see if there
were any spanish speaking morisco at hand to read them for me nor was
there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter for even had i
sought one for an older and better language i should have found him in
short chance provided me with one who when i told him what i wanted and
put the book into his hands opened it in the middle and after reading a
little in it began to laugh i asked him what he was laughing at and he
replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by
way of a note i bade him tell it to me and he still laughing said in
the margin as i told you this is written this dulcinea del toboso so
often mentioned in this history had they say the best hand of any
woman in all la mancha for salting pigs
when i heard dulcinea del toboso named i was struck with surprise and
amazement for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
the history of don quixote with this idea i pressed him to read the
beginning and doing so turning the arabic offhand into castilian he
told me it meant history of don quixote of la mancha written by cide
hamete benengeli an arab historian it required great caution to hide
the joy i felt when the title of the book reached my ears and snatching
it from the silk mercer i bought all the papers and pamphlets from the
boy for half a real and if he had had his wits about him and had known
how eager i was for them he might have safely calculated on making more
than six reals by the bargain i withdrew at once with the morisco into
the cloister of the cathedral and begged him to turn all these pamphlets
that related to don quixote into the castilian tongue without omitting
or adding anything to them offering him whatever payment he pleased he
was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat and
promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch but to make
the matter easier and not to let such a precious find out of my hands i
took him to my house where in little more than a month and a half he
translated the whole just as it is set down here
in the first pamphlet the battle between don quixote and the biscayan was
drawn to the very life they planted in the same attitude as the history
describes their swords raised and the one protected by his buckler the
other by his cushion and the biscayans mule so true to nature that it
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off the biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said don sancho de azpeitia which no
doubt must have been his name and at the feet of rocinante was another
that said don quixote rocinante was marvellously portrayed so long
and thin so lank and lean with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of rocinante had been bestowed upon him near him was sancho panza
holding the halter of his ass at whose feet was another label that said
sancho zancas and according to the picture he must have had a big
belly a short body and long shanks for which reason no doubt the
names of panza and zancas were given him for by these two surnames the
history several times calls him some other trifling particulars might be
mentioned but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do
with the true relation of the history and no history can be bad so long
if against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its
truth it can only be that its author was an arab as lying is a very
common propensity with those of that nation though as they are such
enemies of ours it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than
additions made in the course of it and this is my own opinion for
where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy
a knight he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence which
is ill done and worse contrived for it is the business and duty of
historians to be exact truthful and wholly free from passion and
neither interest nor fear hatred nor love should make them swerve from
the path of truth whose mother is history rival of time storehouse of
deeds witness for the past example and counsel for the present and
warning for the future in this i know will be found all that can be
desired in the pleasantest and if it be wanting in any good quality i
maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of
the subject to be brief its second part according to the translation
with trenchant swords upraised and poised on high it seemed as though
the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven and
earth and hell with such resolution and determination did they bear
themselves the fiery biscayan was the first to strike a blow which was
delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its
course that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the
bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight but that good
fortune which reserved him for greater things turned aside the sword of
his adversary so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder it
did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour carrying
away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear all which with
fearful ruin fell to the ground leaving him in a sorry plight
good god who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled
the heart of our manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this
fashion all that can be said is it was such that he again raised
himself in his stirrups and grasping his sword more firmly with both
hands he came down on the biscayan with such fury smiting him full over
the cushion and over the head that even so good a shield proving
useless as if a mountain had fallen on him he began to bleed from nose
mouth and ears reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule as
no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck at
the same time however he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then
unclasped his arms and the mule taking fright at the terrible blow
made off across the plain and with a few plunges flung its master to the
ground don quixote stood looking on very calmly and when he saw him
fall leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him and
presenting the point of his sword to his eyes bade him surrender or he
would cut his head off the biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable
to answer a word and it would have gone hard with him so blind was don
quixote had not the ladies in the coach who had hitherto been watching
the combat in great terror hastened to where he stood and implored him
with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of
sparing their squires life to which don quixote replied with much
gravity and dignity in truth fair ladies i am well content to do what
ye ask of me but it must be on one condition and understanding which is
that this knight promise me to go to the village of el toboso and on my
behalf present himself before the peerless lady dulcinea that she deal
with him as shall be most pleasing to her
the terrified and disconsolate ladies without discussing don quixotes
demand or asking who dulcinea might be promised that their squire should
then on the faith of that promise said don quixote i shall do him
no further harm though he well deserves it of me
of the pleasant discourse that passed between don quixote and his squire
now by this time sancho had risen rather the worse for the handling of
the friars muleteers and stood watching the battle of his master don
quixote and praying to god in his heart that it might be his will to
grant him the victory and that he might thereby win some island to make
him governor of as he had promised seeing therefore that the struggle
was now over and that his master was returning to mount rocinante he
approached to hold the stirrup for him and before he could mount he
went on his knees before him and taking his hand kissed it saying may
it please your worship senor don quixote to give me the government of
that island which has been won in this hard fight for be it ever so big
i feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as
well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands
to which don quixote replied thou must take notice brother sancho
that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands but
of cross roads in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear
the less have patience for adventures will present themselves from
which i may make you not only a governor but something more
sancho gave him many thanks and again kissing his hand and the skirt of
his hauberk helped him to mount rocinante and mounting his ass himself
proceeded to follow his master who at a brisk pace without taking
leave or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach
turned into a wood that was hard by sancho followed him at his asss
best trot but rocinante stepped out so that seeing himself left behind
he was forced to call to his master to wait for him don quixote did so
reining in rocinante until his weary squire came up who on reaching him
said it seems to me senor it would be prudent in us to go and take
refuge in some church for seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has
been left it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to
the holy brotherhood and arrest us and faith if they do before we
come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it
peace said don quixote where hast thou ever seen or heard that a
knight errant has been arraigned before a court of justice however many
i know nothing about omecils answered sancho nor in my life have had
anything to do with one i only know that the holy brotherhood looks
after those who fight in the fields and in that other matter i do not
then thou needst have no uneasiness my friend said don quixote for
i will deliver thee out of the hands of the chaldeans much more out of
those of the brotherhood but tell me as thou livest hast thou seen a
more valiant knight than i in all the known world hast thou read in
history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack more spirit in
maintaining it more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing
the truth is answered sancho that i have never read any history for
i can neither read nor write but what i will venture to bet is that a
more daring master than your worship i have never served in all the days
of my life and god grant that this daring be not paid for where i have
said what i beg of your worship is to dress your wound for a great deal
of blood flows from that ear and i have here some lint and a little
all that might be well dispensed with said don quixote if i had
remembered to make a vial of the balsam of fierabras for time and
what vial and what balsam is that said sancho panza
it is a balsam answered don quixote the receipt of which i have in
my memory with which one need have no fear of death or dread dying of
any wound and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to
do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the
middle of the body as is wont to happen frequently but neatly and with
great nicety ere the blood congeal to place that portion of the body
which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains
in the saddle taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly then thou
shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam i have mentioned and
thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple
if that be so said panza i renounce henceforth the government of the
promised island and desire nothing more in payment of my many and
faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this
supreme liquor for i am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals
an ounce anywhere and i want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease
and honour but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it
with less than three reals six quarts of it may be made said don
sinner that i am said sancho then why does your worship put off
peace friend answered don quixote greater secrets i mean to teach
thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee and for the present let us
see to the dressing for my ear pains me more than i could wish
sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas but when don
quixote came to see his helmet shattered he was like to lose his senses
and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven be
said i swear by the creator of all things and the four gospels in their
fullest extent to do as the great marquis of mantua did when he swore to
avenge the death of his nephew baldwin and that was not to eat bread
from a table cloth nor embrace his wife and other points which though
i cannot now call them to mind i here grant as expressed until i take
complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against
hearing this sancho said to him your worship should bear in mind
senor don quixote that if the knight has done what was commanded him in
going to present himself before my lady dulcinea del toboso he will have
done all that he was bound to do and does not deserve further punishment
thou hast said well and hit the point answered don quixote and so i
recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him
but i make and confirm it anew to lead the life i have said until such
time as i take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and
as good and think not sancho that i am raising smoke with straw in
doing so for i have one to imitate in the matter since the very same
thing to a hair happened in the case of mambrinos helmet which cost
senor replied sancho let your worship send all such oaths to the
devil for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the
conscience just tell me now if for several days to come we fall in with
no man armed with a helmet what are we to do is the oath to be observed
in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in
your clothes and not to sleep in a house and a thousand other
mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the marquis of
mantua which your worship is now wanting to revive let your worship
observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads
nothing but carriers and carters who not only do not wear helmets but
perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives
thou art wrong there said don quixote for we shall not have been
above two hours among these cross roads before we see more men in armour
than came to albraca to win the fair angelica
enough said sancho so be it then and god grant us success and that
the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon
i have already told thee sancho said don quixote not to give
thyself any uneasiness on that score for if an island should fail there
is the kingdom of denmark or of sobradisa which will fit thee as a ring
fits the finger and all the more that being on terra firma thou wilt
all the better enjoy thyself but let us leave that to its own time see
if thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas because we must
presently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to night and make
the balsam i told thee of for i swear to thee by god this ear is giving
i have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread
said sancho but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like
how little thou knowest about it answered don quixote i would have
thee to know sancho that it is the glory of knights errant to go
without eating for a month and even when they do eat that it should be
of what comes first to hand and this would have been clear to thee hadst
thou read as many histories as i have for though they are very many
among them all i have found no mention made of knights errant eating
unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them and
the rest of the time they passed in dalliance and though it is plain
they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural
functions because in fact they were men like ourselves it is plain
too that wandering as they did the most part of their lives through
woods and wilds and without a cook their most usual fare would be rustic
viands such as those thou now offer me so that friend sancho let not
that distress thee which pleases me and do not seek to make a new world
pardon me your worship said sancho for as i cannot read or write
as i said just now i neither know nor comprehend the rules of the
profession of chivalry henceforward i will stock the alforjas with every
kind of dry fruit for your worship as you are a knight and for myself
as i am not one i will furnish them with poultry and other things more
i do not say sancho replied don quixote that it is imperative on
knights errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of
only that their more usual diet must be those and certain herbs they
found in the fields which they knew and i know too
a good thing it is answered sancho to know those herbs for to my
thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into
and here taking out what he said he had brought the pair made their
repast peaceably and sociably but anxious to find quarters for the
night they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare mounted
at once and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in but
daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by
the huts of some goatherds so they determined to pass the night there
and it was as much to sanchos discontent not to have reached a house as
it was to his masters satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven for
he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of
he was cordially welcomed by the goatherds and sancho having as best he
could put up rocinante and the ass drew towards the fragrance that came
from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire and
though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be
transferred from the pot to the stomach he refrained from doing so as
the goatherds removed them from the fire and laying sheepskins on the
ground quickly spread their rude table and with signs of hearty
good will invited them both to share what they had round the skins six
of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves having first with
rough politeness pressed don quixote to take a seat upon a trough which
they placed for him upside down don quixote seated himself and sancho
remained standing to serve the cup which was made of horn seeing him
that thou mayest see sancho the good that knight errantry contains in
itself and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to
be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world i desire that thou seat
thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people and
that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord and that
thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever i drink from for the same
may be said of knight errantry as of love that it levels all
great thanks said sancho but i may tell your worship that provided i
have enough to eat i can eat it as well or better standing and by
myself than seated alongside of an emperor and indeed if the truth is
to be told what i eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more
relish for me even though it be bread and onions than the turkeys of
those other tables where i am forced to chew slowly drink little wipe
my mouth every minute and cannot sneeze or cough if i want or do other
things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude so senor as for
these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and
follower of knight errantry exchange them for other things which may be
of more use and advantage to me for these though i fully acknowledge
them as received i renounce from this moment to the end of the world
for all that said don quixote thou must seat thyself because him
who humbleth himself god exalteth and seizing him by the arm he forced
the goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and
knights errant and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their
guests who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as
big as ones fist the course of meat finished they spread upon the
sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns and with them they put down a
half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar all this while the
horn was not idle for it went round so constantly now full now empty
like the bucket of a water wheel that it soon drained one of the two
wine skins that were in sight when don quixote had quite appeased his
appetite he took up a handful of the acorns and contemplating them
happy the age happy the time to which the ancients gave the name of
golden not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our
iron one was gained without toil but because they that lived in it knew
not the two words mine and thine in that blessed age all things were
in common to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to
stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood
generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit the clear streams
and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble
abundance the busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts
of the rocks and hollows of the trees offering without usance the
plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand the mighty cork
trees unenforced save of their own courtesy shed the broad light bark
that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes a
protection against the inclemency of heaven alone then all was peace
all friendship all concord as yet the dull share of the crooked plough
had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother
that without compulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile
bosom all that could satisfy sustain and delight the children that then
possessed her then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess
roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill with flowing locks and no
more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and
ever sought to hide nor were their ornaments like those in use to day
set off by tyrian purple and silk tortured in endless fashions but the
wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy wherewith they went as bravely
and becomingly decked as our court dames with all the rare and
far fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them then the
love thoughts of the heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the
heart conceived them nor sought to commend themselves by forced and
rambling verbiage fraud deceit or malice had then not yet mingled with
truth and sincerity justice held her ground undisturbed and unassailed
by the efforts of favour and of interest that now so much impair
pervert and beset her arbitrary law had not yet established itself in
the mind of the judge for then there was no cause to judge and no one to
be judged maidens and modesty as i have said wandered at will alone
and unattended without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine
assault and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure
but now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe not though some new
labyrinth like that of crete conceal and surround her even there the
pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on
the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity and despite of all
seclusion lead them to ruin in defence of these as time advanced and
wickedness increased the order of knights errant was instituted to
defend maidens to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the
needy to this order i belong brother goatherds to whom i return thanks
for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire for
though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to
knights errant yet seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have
welcomed and feasted me it is right that with all the good will in my
all this long harangue which might very well have been spared our
knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the
golden age and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary
argument to the goatherds who listened to him gaping in amazement
without saying a word in reply sancho likewise held his peace and ate
acorns and paid repeated visits to the second wine skin which they had
hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool
don quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing at the
end of which one of the goatherds said that your worship senor
knight errant may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with
ready good will we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of
our comrades sing he will be here before long and he is a very
intelligent youth and deep in love and what is more he can read and
write and play on the rebeck to perfection
the goatherd had hardly done speaking when the notes of the rebeck
reached their ears and shortly after the player came up a very
good looking young man of about two and twenty his comrades asked him if
he had supped and on his replying that he had he who had already made
in that case antonio thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing
a little that the gentleman our guest may see that even in the
mountains and woods there are musicians we have told him of thy
accomplishments and we want thee to show them and prove that we say
true so as thou livest pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy
love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee and that was so much liked
with all my heart said the young man and without waiting for more
pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak and tuning his
rebeck presently began to sing to these words
true it is but as i said it
t was a lie and so i told her
else and once for all i swear it
here the goatherd brought his song to an end and though don quixote
entreated him to sing more sancho had no mind that way being more
inclined for sleep than for listening to songs so said he to his master
your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the
night for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them
i understand thee sancho replied don quixote i perceive clearly
that those visits to the wine skin demand compensation in sleep rather
its sweet to us all blessed be god said sancho
i do not deny it replied don quixote but settle thyself where thou
wilt those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than
in sleeping still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for
me again for it is giving me more pain than it need
sancho did as he bade him but one of the goatherds seeing the wound
told him not to be uneasy as he would apply a remedy with which it would
be soon healed and gathering some leaves of rosemary of which there was
a great quantity there he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt
and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage
assuring him that no other treatment would be required and so it proved
of what a goatherd related to those with don quixote
just then another young man one of those who fetched their provisions
from the village came up and said do you know what is going on in the
how could we know it replied one of them
well then you must know continued the young man this morning that
famous student shepherd called chrysostom died and it is rumoured that
he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of
guillermo the rich she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of
her i mean answered the goatherd and the best of it is he has
directed in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a moor
and at the foot of the rock where the cork tree spring is because as
the story goes and they say he himself said so that was the place
where he first saw her and he has also left other directions which the
clergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they
savour of paganism to all which his great friend ambrosio the student
he who like him also went dressed as a shepherd replies that
everything must be done without any omission according to the directions
left by chrysostom and about this the village is all in commotion
however report says that after all what ambrosio and all the shepherds
his friends desire will be done and to morrow they are coming to bury
him with great ceremony where i said i am sure it will be something
worth seeing at least i will not fail to go and see it even if i knew i
we will do the same answered the goatherds and cast lots to see who
must stay to mind the goats of all
thou sayest well pedro said one though there will be no need of
taking that trouble for i will stay behind for all and dont suppose it
is virtue or want of curiosity in me it is that the splinter that ran
into my foot the other day will not let me walk
for all that we thank thee answered pedro
don quixote asked pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the
shepherdess to which pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead
man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains
who had been a student at salamanca for many years at the end of which
he returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and
deeply read above all they said he was learned in the science of the
stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon
for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time
eclipse it is called friend not cris the darkening of those two
luminaries said don quixote but pedro not troubling himself with
trifles went on with his story saying also he foretold when the year
was going to be one of abundance or estility
sterility or estility answered pedro it is all the same in the end
and i can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him
grew very rich because they did as he advised them bidding them sow
barley this year not wheat this year you may sow pulse and not barley
the next there will be a full oil crop and the three following not a
that science is called astrology said don quixote
i do not know what it is called replied pedro but i know that he
knew all this and more besides but to make an end not many months had
passed after he returned from salamanca when one day he appeared dressed
as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin having put off the long gown
he wore as a scholar and at the same time his great friend ambrosio by
name who had been his companion in his studies took to the shepherds
dress with him i forgot to say that chrysostom who is dead was a great
man for writing verses so much so that he made carols for christmas eve
and plays for corpus christi which the young men of our village acted
and all said they were excellent when the villagers saw the two scholars
so unexpectedly appearing in shepherds dress they were lost in wonder
and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change
about this time the father of our chrysostom died and he was left heir
to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land no small
number of cattle and sheep and a large sum of money of all of which the
young man was left dissolute owner and indeed he was deserving of it
all for he was a very good comrade and kind hearted and a friend of
worthy folk and had a countenance like a benediction presently it came
to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to
wander about these wastes after that shepherdess marcela our lad
mentioned a while ago with whom the deceased chrysostom had fallen in
love and i must tell you now for it is well you should know it who
this girl is perhaps and even without any perhaps you will not have
heard anything like it all the days of your life though you should live
say sarra said don quixote unable to endure the goatherds confusion
the sarna lives long enough answered pedro and if senor you must
go finding fault with words at every step we shall not make an end of it
pardon me friend said don quixote but as there is such a
difference between sarna and sarra i told you of it however you have
answered very rightly for sarna lives longer than sarra so continue
your story and i will not object any more to anything
i say then my dear sir said the goatherd that in our village there
was a farmer even richer than the father of chrysostom who was named
guillermo and upon whom god bestowed over and above great wealth a
daughter at whose birth her mother died the most respected woman there
was in this neighbourhood i fancy i can see her now with that
countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other and
moreover active and kind to the poor for which i trust that at the
present moment her soul is in bliss with god in the other world her
husband guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife leaving
his daughter marcela a child and rich to the care of an uncle of hers
a priest and prebendary in our village the girl grew up with such beauty
that it reminded us of her mothers which was very great and yet it was
thought that the daughters would exceed it and so when she reached the
age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed god that
had made her so beautiful and the greater number were in love with her
past redemption her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement
but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that as well for
it as for her great wealth her uncle was asked solicited and
importuned to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of
those many leagues round and by the persons of highest quality in them
but he being a good christian man though he desired to give her in
marriage at once seeing her to be old enough was unwilling to do so
without her consent not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which
the custody of the girls property brought him while he put off her
marriage and faith this was said in praise of the good priest in more
than one set in the town for i would have you know sir errant that in
these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped
at and rest assured as i am that the priest must be over and above
good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him especially in
that is the truth said don quixote but go on for the story is very
good and you good pedro tell it with very good grace
may that of the lord not be wanting to me said pedro that is the one
to have to proceed you must know that though the uncle put before his
niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the
many who had asked her in marriage begging her to marry and make a
choice according to her own taste she never gave any other answer than
that she had no desire to marry just yet and that being so young she did
not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony at these to all
appearance reasonable excuses that she made her uncle ceased to urge
her and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate
herself to her own liking for said he and he said quite right parents
are not to settle children in life against their will but when one least
looked for it lo and behold one day the demure marcela makes her
appearance turned shepherdess and in spite of her uncle and all those
of the town that strove to dissuade her took to going a field with the
other shepherd lasses of the village and tending her own flock and so
since she appeared in public and her beauty came to be seen openly i
could not well tell you how many rich youths gentlemen and peasants
have adopted the costume of chrysostom and go about these fields making
love to her one of these as has been already said was our deceased
friend of whom they say that he did not love but adore her but you must
not suppose because marcela chose a life of such liberty and
independence and of so little or rather no retirement that she has
given any occasion or even the semblance of one for disparagement of
her purity and modesty on the contrary such and so great is the
vigilance with which she watches over her honour that of all those that
court and woo her not one has boasted or can with truth boast that she
has given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire for
although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the
shepherds and treats them courteously and kindly should any one of them
come to declare his intention to her though it be one as proper and holy
as that of matrimony she flings him from her like a catapult and with
this kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the
plague had got into it for her affability and her beauty draw on the
hearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her but
her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair and so
they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and
hard hearted and other names of the same sort which well describe the
nature of her character and if you should remain here any time senor
you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the
rejected ones who pursue her not far from this there is a spot where
there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches and there is not one of them
but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of marcela and
above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say
more plainly that marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty
here one shepherd is sighing there another is lamenting there love
songs are heard here despairing elegies one will pass all the hours of
the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock and there without
having closed his weeping eyes the sun finds him in the morning bemused
and bereft of sense and another without relief or respite to his sighs
stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer
noontide makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens and over one and
the other over these and all the beautiful marcela triumphs free and
careless and all of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride
will come to and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming
a nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme all
that i have told you being such well established truth i am persuaded
that what they say of the cause of chrysostoms death as our lad told
us is the same and so i advise you senor fail not to be present
to morrow at his burial which will be well worth seeing for chrysostom
had many friends and it is not half a league from this place to where he
i will make a point of it said don quixote and i thank you for the
pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale
oh said the goatherd i do not know even the half of what has
happened to the lovers of marcela but perhaps to morrow we may fall in
with some shepherd on the road who can tell us and now it will be well
for you to go and sleep under cover for the night air may hurt your
wound though with the remedy i have applied to you there is no fear of
sancho panza who was wishing the goatherds loquacity at the devil on
his part begged his master to go into pedros hut to sleep he did so
and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady dulcinea in
imitation of the lovers of marcela sancho panza settled himself between
rocinante and his ass and slept not like a lover who had been
discarded but like a man who had been soundly kicked
in which is ended the story of the shepherdess marcela with other
bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the
east when five of the six goatherds came to rouse don quixote and tell
him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of
chrysostom they would bear him company don quixote who desired nothing
better rose and ordered sancho to saddle and pannel at once which he
did with all despatch and with the same they all set out forthwith they
had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they
saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins
and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter
oleander each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand and along
with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome
travelling dress with three servants on foot accompanying them
courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting and inquiring one of the
other which way each party was going they learned that all were bound
for the scene of the burial so they went on all together
one of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him it seems
to me senor vivaldo that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall
incur in seeing this remarkable funeral for remarkable it cannot but be
judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us of both the
so i think too replied vivaldo and i would delay not to say a day
but four for the sake of seeing it
don quixote asked them what it was they had heard of marcela and
chrysostom the traveller answered that the same morning they had met
these shepherds and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they
had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise which one
of them gave describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a
shepherdess called marcela and the loves of many who courted her
together with the death of that chrysostom to whose burial they were
going in short he repeated all that pedro had related to don quixote
this conversation dropped and another was commenced by him who was
called vivaldo asking don quixote what was the reason that led him to go
armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful to which don quixote
replied the pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in
any other fashion easy life enjoyment and repose were invented for
soft courtiers but toil unrest and arms were invented and made for
those alone whom the world calls knights errant of whom i though
the instant they heard this all set him down as mad and the better to
settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was vivaldo
proceeded to ask him what knights errant meant
have not your worships replied don quixote read the annals and
histories of england in which are recorded the famous deeds of king
arthur whom we in our popular castilian invariably call king artus with
regard to whom it is an ancient tradition and commonly received all over
that kingdom of great britain that this king did not die but was
changed by magic art into a raven and that in process of time he is to
return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre for which reason it
cannot be proved that from that time to this any englishman ever killed a
raven well then in the time of this good king that famous order of
chivalry of the knights of the round table was instituted and the amour
of don lancelot of the lake with the queen guinevere occurred precisely
as is there related the go between and confidante therein being the
highly honourable dame quintanona whence came that ballad so well known
with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and
war handed down from that time then this order of chivalry went on
extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world
and in it famous and renowned for their deeds were the mighty amadis of
gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation and the
valiant felixmarte of hircania and the never sufficiently praised
tirante el blanco and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and
talked with the invincible knight don belianis of greece this then
sirs is to be a knight errant and what i have spoken of is the order of
his chivalry of which as i have already said i though a sinner have
made profession and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do i
profess and so i go through these solitudes and wilds seeking
adventures resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most
perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy
by these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of
don quixotes being out of his senses and of the form of madness that
overmastered him at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt
on first becoming acquainted with it and vivaldo who was a person of
great shrewdness and of a lively temperament in order to beguile the
short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain the
scene of the burial sought to give him an opportunity of going on with
his absurdities so he said to him it seems to me senor knight errant
that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions
in the world and i imagine even that of the carthusian monks is not so
as austere it may perhaps be replied our don quixote but so
necessary for the world i am very much inclined to doubt for if the
truth is to be told the soldier who executes what his captain orders
does no less than the captain himself who gives the order my meaning
is that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to heaven for the welfare of
the world but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray
for defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords
