thank you said the marquis very sweetly indeed
his tone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musical
in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to be at once your
bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in
i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffee
i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter de cachet would
it is possible said the uncle with great calmness for the honour
of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent
i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before
yesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew
i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle with refined
politeness i would not be sure of that a good opportunity for
consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself but it is useless to discuss the question i am as you say
at a disadvantage these little instruments of correction these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that
might so incommode you are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity they are sought by so many and they are granted
comparatively to so few it used not to be so but france in all such
things is changed for the worse our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar from this room many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged in the next room my bedroom
one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter his daughter we have
lost many privileges a new philosophy has become the mode and the
assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as
to say would but might cause us real inconvenience all very bad very
the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his head
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern
time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our name to be
let us hope so said the uncle detestation of the high is the
there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face i can
look at in all this country round about us which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery
a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the family
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur
hah and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff and lightly
but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness closeness
and dislike than was comportable with its wearers assumption of
repression is the only lasting philosophy the dark deference of fear
and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to it shuts
that might not be so long as the marquis supposed if a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence could have been shown to
him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly fire charred plunder wrecked rains as for the roof
he vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new
way to wit for ever from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets
meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour and repose
of the family if you will not but you must be fatigued shall we
sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits
we have done wrong repeated the marquis with an inquiring smile
and delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself
our family our honourable family whose honour is of so much account
to both of us in such different ways even in my fathers time we did
a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure whatever it was why need i speak of my fathers time
when it is equally yours can i separate my fathers twin brother joint
and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that is
frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the last
look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to
redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain
seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him on the
breast with his forefinger they were now standing by the hearth you
will for ever seek them in vain be assured
every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was
cruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew with his snuff box in his hand once again he
touched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword with which in delicate finesse he ran him through the
my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have
when he had said it he took a culminating pinch of snuff and put his
better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing a small
bell on the table and accept your natural destiny but you are lost
this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadly i
are they both yours to renounce france may be but is the property it
is scarcely worth mentioning but is it yet
i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet if it passed
which i have the vanity to hope is not probable
you do me too much honour said the marquis still i prefer that
 i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere it is little to
relinquish what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin
hah said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room
to the eye it is fair enough here but seen in its integrity
under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste
hah said the marquis again in a well satisfied manner
if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the
weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in
another generation suffer less but it is not for me there is a curse
and you said the uncle forgive my curiosity do you under your new
i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at
their backs may have to do some day work
yes the family honour sir is safe from me in this country the
family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other
the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed chamber to be
lighted it now shone brightly through the door of communication the
marquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of his
england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there he observed then turning his calm face to his nephew
i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may
be indebted to you sir for the rest it is my refuge
they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of many you
know a compatriot who has found a refuge there a doctor
yes said the marquis you are fatigued good night
as he bent his head in his most courtly manner there was a secrecy
in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly at the same
time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes and the thin
straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with a sarcasm that
yes repeated the marquis a doctor with a daughter yes so
commences the new philosophy you are fatigued good night
it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his the nephew
looked at him in vain in passing on to the door
good night said the uncle i look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning good repose light monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will he
added to himself before he rang his little bell again and summoned his
the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber robe to prepare himself gently for sleep that hot still
night rustling about the room his softly slippered feet making no
noise on the floor he moved like a refined tiger looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort in story whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off or just
he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again at the
scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind the slow
toil up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent the mill the
prison on the crag the little village in the hollow the peasants at
the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage that fountain suggested the paris fountain
the little bundle lying on the step the women bending over it and the
tall man with his arms up crying dead
i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may go to bed
so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep
the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours for three heavy hours the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men poets but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them
for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion and human
stared blindly at the night dead darkness lay on all the landscape
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads
the burial place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another the figure on the cross might
have come down for anything that could be seen of it in the village
taxers and taxed were fast asleep dreaming perhaps of banquets as
the starved usually do and of ease and rest as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may its lean inhabitants slept soundly and were fed and
the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard both melting away like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of time through three dark
hours then the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened
lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees and poured its radiance over the hill in the glow the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stone faces
crimsoned the carol of the birds was loud and high and on the
weather beaten sill of the great window of the bed chamber of monsieur
the marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might
at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed and with open
mouth and dropped under jaw looked awe stricken
now the sun was full up and movement began in the village casement
windows opened crazy doors were unbarred and people came forth
shivering chilled as yet by the new sweet air then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population some to the
fountain some to the fields men and women here to dig and delve men
and women there to see to the poor live stock and lead the bony cows
out to such pasture as could be found by the roadside in the church
and at the cross a kneeling figure or two attendant on the latter
prayers the led cow trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awoke gradually and
surely first the lonely boar spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old then had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine
now doors and windows were thrown open horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways leaves sparkled and rustled at iron grated windows dogs
pulled hard at their chains and reared impatient to be loosed
all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life and the
return of morning surely not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau nor the running up and down the stairs nor the hurried
figures on the terrace nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away
what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads already
at work on the hill top beyond the village with his days dinner not
much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crows while to
peck at on a heap of stones had the birds carrying some grains of it
to a distance dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds whether or
no the mender of roads ran on the sultry morning as if for his life
down the hill knee high in dust and never stopped till he got to the
all the people of the village were at the fountain standing about
in their depressed manner and whispering low but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise the led cows hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them were looking stupidly
on or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter some of
the people of the chateau and some of those of the posting house and
all the taxing authorities were armed more or less and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way that was
highly fraught with nothing already the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap what did all this portend
and what portended the swift hoisting up of monsieur gabelle behind
a servant on horseback and the conveying away of the said gabelle
double laden though the horse was at a gallop like a new version of
it portended that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau
the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night and had added
the one stone face wanting the stone face for which it had waited
it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis it was like a fine
mask suddenly startled made angry and petrified driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it was a knife round its hilt
was a frill of paper on which was scrawled
drive him fast to his tomb this from jacques
more months to the number of twelve had come and gone and mr charles
darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french
language who was conversant with french literature in this age he
would have been a professor in that age he was a tutor he read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy he could write of them besides in
sound english and render them into sound english such masters were not
at that time easily found princes that had been and kings that were
to be were not yet of the teacher class and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of tellsons ledgers to turn cooks and carpenters as a
tutor whose attainments made the students way unusually pleasant and
profitable and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge young mr darnay soon became
known and encouraged he was well acquainted more over with the
circumstances of his country and those were of ever growing interest
so with great perseverance and untiring industry he prospered
in london he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold nor
to lie on beds of roses if he had had any such exalted expectation he
would not have prospered he had expected labour and he found it and
did it and made the best of it in this his prosperity consisted
a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in european languages instead of conveying greek
and latin through the custom house the rest of his time he passed in
now from the days when it was always summer in eden to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes the world of a man has
invariably gone one way charles darnays way the way of the love of a
he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger he had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him but he had not yet spoken to her on the subject the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long
long dusty roads the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream had been done a year and he had never yet by so
much as a single spoken word disclosed to her the state of his heart
that he had his reasons for this he knew full well it was again a
summer day when lately arrived in london from his college occupation
he turned into the quiet corner in soho bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to doctor manette it was the close of the summer
day and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross
he found the doctor reading in his arm chair at a window the energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness had been gradually restored to him he was now a
very energetic man indeed with great firmness of purpose strength
of resolution and vigour of action in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties but this had never been
frequently observable and had grown more and more rare
he studied much slept little sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease and was equably cheerful to him now entered charles darnay at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand
charles darnay i rejoice to see you we have been counting on your
return these three or four days past mr stryver and sydney carton were
both here yesterday and both made you out to be more than due
i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter he answered
a little coldly as to them though very warmly as to the doctor miss
is well said the doctor as he stopped short and your return will
delight us all she has gone out on some household matters but will
doctor manette i knew she was from home i took the opportunity of her
being from home to beg to speak to you
yes said the doctor with evident constraint bring your chair here
he complied as to the chair but appeared to find the speaking on less
i have had the happiness doctor manette of being so intimate here
so he at length began for some year and a half that i hope the topic
on which i am about to touch may not 
he was stayed by the doctors putting out his hand to stop him when he
had kept it so a little while he said drawing it back
it is hard for me to speak of her at any time it is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours charles darnay
it is a tone of fervent admiration true homage and deep love doctor
there was another blank silence before her father rejoined
i believe it i do you justice i believe it
his constraint was so manifest and it was so manifest too that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject that charles
you anticipate what i would say though you cannot know how earnestly
i say it how earnestly i feel it without knowing my secret heart and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden dear doctor manette i love your daughter fondly dearly
disinterestedly devotedly if ever there were love in the world i love
her you have loved yourself let your old love speak for me
the doctor sat with his face turned away and his eyes bent on the
ground at the last words he stretched out his hand again hurriedly
not that sir let that be i adjure you do not recall that
his cry was so like a cry of actual pain that it rang in charles
darnays ears long after he had ceased he motioned with the hand he had
extended and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause the latter
i ask your pardon said the doctor in a subdued tone after some
moments i do not doubt your loving lucie you may be satisfied of it
he turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him or
raise his eyes his chin dropped upon his hand and his white hair
it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father her father thanks
he offered his hand but his eyes did not go with it
i know said darnay respectfully how can i fail to know doctor
manette i who have seen you together from day to day that between
you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual so touching so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured that it
can have few parallels even in the tenderness between a father and
child i know doctor manette how can i fail to know that mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman there
is in her heart towards you all the love and reliance of infancy
itself i know that as in her childhood she had no parent so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her i know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life you could
hardly be invested in her sight with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her i know that when she is clinging to
you the hands of baby girl and woman all in one are round your
neck i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age sees and loves you at my age loves her mother broken hearted
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration i
have known this night and day since i have known you in your home
her father sat silent with his face bent down his breathing was a
little quickened but he repressed all other signs of agitation
dear doctor manette always knowing this always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you i have forborne and forborne as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it i have felt and do even
now feel that to bring my love even mine between you is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself but i love her
heaven is my witness that i love her
i believe it answered her father mournfully i have thought so
but do not believe said darnay upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound that if my fortune were so cast as
that being one day so happy as to make her my wife i must at any time
put any separation between her and you i could or would breathe a
word of what i now say besides that i should know it to be hopeless i
should know it to be a baseness if i had any such possibility even at
a remote distance of years harboured in my thoughts and hidden in my
heart if it ever had been there if it ever could be there i could not
he laid his own upon it as he spoke
no dear doctor manette like you a voluntary exile from france like
you driven from it by its distractions oppressions and miseries like
you striving to live away from it by my own exertions and trusting
in a happier future i look only to sharing your fortunes sharing your
life and home and being faithful to you to the death not to divide
with lucie her privilege as your child companion and friend but to
come in aid of it and bind her closer to you if such a thing can be
his touch still lingered on her fathers hand answering the touch for a
moment but not coldly her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference a struggle was evidently in his face a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread
you speak so feelingly and so manfully charles darnay that i thank
you with all my heart and will open all my heart or nearly so have
you any reason to believe that lucie loves you
is it the immediate object of this confidence that you may at once
not even so i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks i
might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness to morrow
i ask none sir but i have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power if you should deem it right to give me some
i well understand that without you i could have no hope i well
understand that even if miss manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart do not think i have the presumption to assume so much i
could retain no place in it against her love for her father
if that be so do you see what on the other hand is involved in it
i understand equally well that a word from her father in any suitors
favour would outweigh herself and all the world for which reason
doctor manette said darnay modestly but firmly i would not ask that
i am sure of it charles darnay mysteries arise out of close love as
well as out of wide division in the former case they are subtle and
delicate and difficult to penetrate my daughter lucie is in this one
respect such a mystery to me i can make no guess at the state of her
may i ask sir if you think she is  as he hesitated her father
her father considered a little before he answered
you have seen mr carton here yourself mr stryver is here too
occasionally if it be at all it can only be by one of these
i had not thought of both i should not think either likely you want
a promise from me tell me what it is
it is that if miss manette should bring to you at any time on her own
part such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you you will
bear testimony to what i have said and to your belief in it i hope you
may be able to think so well of me as to urge no influence against
me i say nothing more of my stake in this this is what i ask the
condition on which i ask it and which you have an undoubted right to
i give the promise said the doctor without any condition i believe
your object to be purely and truthfully as you have stated it i
believe your intention is to perpetuate and not to weaken the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self if she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness i will give her to you
if there were charles darnay if there were 
the young man had taken his hand gratefully their hands were joined as
 any fancies any reasons any apprehensions anything whatsoever
new or old against the man she really loved the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head they should all be obliterated for her
sake she is everything to me more to me than suffering more to me
than wrong more to me well this is idle talk
so strange was the way in which he faded into silence and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak that darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it
you said something to me said doctor manette breaking into a smile
he was at a loss how to answer until he remembered having spoken of a
condition relieved as his mind reverted to that he answered
your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part my present name though but slightly changed from my mothers is
not as you will remember my own i wish to tell you what that is and
i wish it that i may the better deserve your confidence and have no
for an instant the doctor even had his two hands at his ears for
another instant even had his two hands laid on darnays lips
tell me when i ask you not now if your suit should prosper if lucie
should love you you shall tell me on your marriage morning do you
give me your hand she will be home directly and it is better she
should not see us together to night go god bless you
it was dark when charles darnay left him and it was an hour later and
darker when lucie came home she hurried into the room alone for
miss pross had gone straight up stairs and was surprised to find his
my father she called to him father dear
nothing was said in answer but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom passing lightly across the intermediate room she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened crying to herself with her
blood all chilled what shall i do what shall i do
her uncertainty lasted but a moment she hurried back and tapped at
his door and softly called to him the noise ceased at the sound of
her voice and he presently came out to her and they walked up and down
she came down from her bed to look at him in his sleep that night he
slept heavily and his tray of shoemaking tools and his old unfinished
sydney said mr stryver on that self same night or morning to his
jackal mix another bowl of punch i have something to say to you
sydney had been working double tides that night and the night before
and the night before that and a good many nights in succession making
a grand clearance among mr stryvers papers before the setting in
of the long vacation the clearance was effected at last the stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up everything was got rid of until
november should come with its fogs atmospheric and fogs legal and
sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application it had taken a deal of extra wet towelling to pull him
through the night a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling and he was in a very damaged condition as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
are you mixing that other bowl of punch said stryver the portly with
his hands in his waistband glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
now look here i am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me i intend to marry
yes and not for money what do you say now
i dont feel disposed to say much who is she
i am not going to guess at five oclock in the morning with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head if you want me to guess you must ask
well then ill tell you said stryver coming slowly into a sitting
posture sydney i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you
and you returned sydney busy concocting the punch are such a
come rejoined stryver laughing boastfully though i dont prefer
any claim to being the soul of romance for i hope i know better still
i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you
you are a luckier if you mean that
i dont mean that i mean i am a man of more more 
say gallantry while you are about it suggested carton
well ill say gallantry my meaning is that i am a man said stryver
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch who cares more to
be agreeable who takes more pains to be agreeable who knows better how
to be agreeable in a womans society than you do
no but before i go on said stryver shaking his head in his bullying
way ill have this out with you youve been at doctor manettes house
as much as i have or more than i have why i have been ashamed of your
moroseness there your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind that upon my life and soul i have been ashamed of you
it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar to
be ashamed of anything returned sydney you ought to be much obliged
you shall not get off in that way rejoined stryver shouldering the
rejoinder at him no sydney its my duty to tell you and i tell you
to your face to do you good that you are a devilish ill conditioned
fellow in that sort of society you are a disagreeable fellow
sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made and laughed
look at me said stryver squaring himself i have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have being more independent in circumstances
i never saw you do it yet muttered carton
i do it because its politic i do it on principle and look at me i
you dont get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions
answered carton with a careless air i wish you would keep to that as
to me will you never understand that i am incorrigible
he asked the question with some appearance of scorn
you have no business to be incorrigible was his friends answer
i have no business to be at all that i know of said sydney carton
now dont let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable
sydney said mr stryver preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make because i know you dont mean
half you say and if you meant it all it would be of no importance i
make this little preface because you once mentioned the young lady to
sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend
you made mention of the young lady as a golden haired doll the young
lady is miss manette if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way sydney i might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation but you are not
you want that sense altogether therefore i am no more annoyed when i
think of the expression than i should be annoyed by a mans opinion of
a picture of mine who had no eye for pictures or of a piece of music
of mine who had no ear for music
sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate drank it by bumpers
now you know all about it syd said mr stryver i dont care about
fortune she is a charming creature and i have made up my mind to
please myself on the whole i think i can afford to please myself she
will have in me a man already pretty well off and a rapidly rising man
and a man of some distinction it is a piece of good fortune for her
but she is worthy of good fortune are you astonished
carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i be
carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i not approve
well said his friend stryver you take it more easily than i fancied
you would and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would
be though to be sure you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will yes sydney i have had
enough of this style of life with no other as a change from it i
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it when he doesnt he can stay away and i feel
that miss manette will tell well in any station and will always do me
credit so i have made up my mind and now sydney old boy i want to
say a word to you about your prospects you are in a bad way you
know you really are in a bad way you dont know the value of money
you live hard youll knock up one of these days and be ill and poor
you really ought to think about a nurse
the prosperous patronage with which he said it made him look twice as
big as he was and four times as offensive
now let me recommend you pursued stryver to look it in the face
i have looked it in the face in my different way look it in the face

mr stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the doctors daughter resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the long vacation after some mental
debating of the point he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before michaelmas term or in the little christmas vacation between it
as to the strength of his case he had not a doubt about it but clearly
saw his way to the verdict argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds the only grounds ever worth taking into account it was a
plain case and had not a weak spot in it he called himself for the
plaintiff there was no getting over his evidence the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief and the jury did not even turn to
consider after trying it stryver c j was satisfied that no plainer
accordingly mr stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal
proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens that failing to
ranelagh that unaccountably failing too it behoved him to present
himself in soho and there declare his noble mind
towards soho therefore mr stryver shouldered his way from the temple
while the bloom of the long vacations infancy was still upon it
anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet
on saint dunstans side of temple bar bursting in his full blown way
along the pavement to the jostlement of all weaker people might have
his way taking him past tellsons and he both banking at tellsons and
knowing mr lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes it entered mr
stryvers mind to enter the bank and reveal to mr lorry the brightness
of the soho horizon so he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat stumbled down the two steps got past the two ancient
cashiers and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr
lorry sat at great books ruled for figures with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too and everything
halloa said mr stryver how do you do i hope you are well
it was stryvers grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place or space he was so much too big for tellsons that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance as though he
squeezed them against the wall the house itself magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far off perspective lowered displeased as if
the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat
the discreet mr lorry said in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances how do you do mr stryver how do
you do sir and shook hands there was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands always to be seen in any clerk at tellsons who shook
hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air he shook in a
self abnegating way as one who shook for tellson and co

stryver  mr lorry paused and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner as if he were compelled against his will to add internally

opening his eyes wider and taking a long breath if i understand you
mr lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
