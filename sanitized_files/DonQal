invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones called
down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his
promise shed more tears redoubled his sighs and pressed me closer in
his arms from which he had never allowed me to escape and so i was left
by my maid and ceased to be one and he became a traitor and a perjured
the day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so
quickly i imagine as don fernando wished for when desire has attained
its object the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure i
say so because don fernando made all haste to leave me and by the
adroitness of my maid who was indeed the one who had admitted him
gained the street before daybreak but on taking leave of me he told me
though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came that i
might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his
oaths and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and
placed it upon mine he then took his departure and i was left i know
not whether sorrowful or happy all i can say is i was left agitated and
troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place and i had
not the spirit or else it did not occur to me to chide my maid for the
treachery she had been guilty of in concealing don fernando in my
chamber for as yet i was unable to make up my mind whether what had
befallen me was for good or evil i told don fernando at parting that as
i was now his he might see me on other nights in the same way until it
should be his pleasure to let the matter become known but except the
following night he came no more nor for more than a month could i catch
a glimpse of him in the street or in church while i wearied myself with
watching for one although i knew he was in the town and almost every
day went out hunting a pastime he was very fond of i remember well how
sad and dreary those days and hours were to me i remember well how i
began to doubt as they went by and even to lose confidence in the faith
of don fernando and i remember too how my maid heard those words in
reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before and how i was
forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my
countenance not to give my parents cause to ask me why i was so
melancholy and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply but all this was
suddenly brought to an end for the time came when all such
considerations were disregarded and there was no further question of
honour when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known
abroad the reason was that a few days later it was reported in the town
that don fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of
rare beauty the daughter of parents of distinguished position though
not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a
match it was said too that her name was luscinda and that at the
cardenio heard the name of luscinda but he only shrugged his shoulders
bit his lips bent his brows and before long two streams of tears
escaped from his eyes dorothea however did not interrupt her story
this sad intelligence reached my ears and instead of being struck with
a chill with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that i scarcely
restrained myself from rushing out into the streets crying aloud and
proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which i was the victim
but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution i
formed to be carried out the same night and that was to assume this
dress which i got from a servant of my fathers one of the zagals as
they are called in farmhouses to whom i confided the whole of my
misfortune and whom i entreated to accompany me to the city where i
heard my enemy was he though he remonstrated with me for my boldness
and condemned my resolution when he saw me bent upon my purpose offered
to bear me company as he said to the end of the world i at once packed
up in a linen pillow case a womans dress and some jewels and money to
provide for emergencies and in the silence of the night without letting
my treacherous maid know i sallied forth from the house accompanied by
my servant and abundant anxieties and on foot set out for the city but
borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it if not to prevent
what i presumed to be already done at least to call upon don fernando to
tell me with what conscience he had done it i reached my destination in
two days and a half and on entering the city inquired for the house of
luscindas parents the first person i asked gave me more in reply than i
sought to know he showed me the house and told me all that had occurred
at the betrothal of the daughter of the family an affair of such
notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the
street he said that on the night of don fernandos betrothal with
luscinda as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying yes
she was taken with a sudden fainting fit and that on the bridegroom
approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air he found a
paper in her own handwriting in which she said and declared that she
could not be don fernandos bride because she was already cardenios
who according to the mans account was a gentleman of distinction of
the same city and that if she had accepted don fernando it was only in
obedience to her parents in short he said the words of the paper made
it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal
and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was
confirmed it was said by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes
on seeing this don fernando persuaded that luscinda had befooled
slighted and trifled with him assailed her before she had recovered
from her swoon and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been
found and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who were
present prevented him it was said moreover that don fernando went away
at once and that luscinda did not recover from her prostration until the
next day when she told her parents how she was really the bride of that
cardenio i have mentioned i learned besides that cardenio according to
report had been present at the betrothal and that upon seeing her
betrothed contrary to his expectation he had quitted the city in
despair leaving behind him a letter declaring the wrong luscinda had
done him and his intention of going where no one should ever see him
again all this was a matter of notoriety in the city and everyone spoke
of it especially when it became known that luscinda was missing from her
fathers house and from the city for she was not to be found anywhere
to the distraction of her parents who knew not what steps to take to
recover her what i learned revived my hopes and i was better pleased
not to have found don fernando than to find him married for it seemed to
me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case and i
thought that perhaps heaven had put this impediment in the way of the
second marriage to lead him to recognise his obligations under the
former one and reflect that as a christian he was bound to consider his
soul above all human objects all this passed through my mind and i
strove to comfort myself without comfort indulging in faint and distant
hopes of cherishing that life that i now abhor
but while i was in the city uncertain what to do as i could not find
don fernando i heard notice given by the public crier offering a great
reward to anyone who should find me and giving the particulars of my age
and of the very dress i wore and i heard it said that the lad who came
with me had taken me away from my fathers house a thing that cut me to
the heart showing how low my good name had fallen since it was not
enough that i should lose it by my flight but they must add with whom i
had fled and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my
consideration the instant i heard the notice i quitted the city with my
servant who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me
and the same night for fear of discovery we entered the most thickly
wooded part of these mountains but as is commonly said one evil calls
up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of
one still greater and so it proved in my case for my worthy servant
until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot
moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty sought to take
advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him
and with little shame and less fear of god and respect for me began to
make overtures to me and finding that i replied to the effrontery of his
proposals with justly severe language he laid aside the entreaties which
he had employed at first and began to use violence
but just heaven that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions
so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion i
pushed him over a precipice where i left him whether dead or alive i
know not and then with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror
and fatigue i made my way into the mountains without any other thought
or purpose save that of hiding myself among them and escaping my father
and those despatched in search of me by his orders it is now i know not
how many months since with this object i came here where i met a
herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this
sierra and all this time i have been serving him as herd striving to
keep always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly
betrayed me but all my care and pains were unavailing for my master
made the discovery that i was not a man and harboured the same base
designs as my servant and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in
cases of difficulty and i had no precipice or ravine at hand down which
to fling the master and cure his passion as i had in the servants case
i thought it a lesser evil to leave him and again conceal myself among
these crags than make trial of my strength and argument with him so as
i say once more i went into hiding to seek for some place where i might
with sighs and tears implore heaven to have pity on my misery and grant
me help and strength to escape from it or let me die among the
solitudes leaving no trace of an unhappy being who by no fault of hers
has furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad
which treats of the droll device and method adopted to extricate our
love stricken knight from the severe penance he had imposed upon himself
such sirs is the true story of my sad adventures judge for yourselves
now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard and the tears that
flowed from my eyes had not sufficient cause even if i had indulged in
them more freely and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you
will see that consolation is idle as there is no possible remedy for it
all i ask of you is what you may easily and reasonably do to show me
where i may pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by
those who are in search of me for though the great love my parents bear
me makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them so great is my
feeling of shame at the mere thought that i cannot present myself before
them as they expect that i had rather banish myself from their sight for
ever than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld mine
stripped of that purity they had a right to expect in me
with these words she became silent and the colour that overspread her
face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart in
theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes but
as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice
cardenio forestalled him saying so then senora you are the fair
dorothea the only daughter of the rich clenardo dorothea was
astonished at hearing her fathers name and at the miserable appearance
of him who mentioned it for it has been already said how wretchedly clad
and who may you be brother who seem to know my fathers name so well
for so far if i remember rightly i have not mentioned it in the whole
i am that unhappy being senora replied cardenio whom as you have
said luscinda declared to be her husband i am the unfortunate cardenio
whom the wrong doing of him who has brought you to your present condition
has reduced to the state you see me in bare ragged bereft of all human
comfort and what is worse of reason for i only possess it when heaven
is pleased for some short space to restore it to me i dorothea am he
who witnessed the wrong done by don fernando and waited to hear the
yes uttered by which luscinda owned herself his betrothed i am he who
had not courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended or what came of
the paper that was found in her bosom because my heart had not the
fortitude to endure so many strokes of ill fortune at once and so losing
patience i quitted the house and leaving a letter with my host which i
entreated him to place in luscindas hands i betook myself to these
solitudes resolved to end here the life i hated as if it were my mortal
enemy but fate would not rid me of it contenting itself with robbing me
of my reason perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune i have had in
meeting you for if that which you have just told us be true as i
believe it to be it may be that heaven has yet in store for both of us a
happier termination to our misfortunes than we look for because seeing
that luscinda cannot marry don fernando being mine as she has herself
so openly declared and that don fernando cannot marry her as he is
yours we may reasonably hope that heaven will restore to us what is
ours as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed and
as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild
fancy i entreat you senora to form new resolutions in your better
mind as i mean to do in mine preparing yourself to look forward to
happier fortunes for i swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a
christian not to desert you until i see you in possession of don
fernando and if i cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation
to you in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a
gentleman gives me and with just cause challenge him on account of the
injury he has done you not regarding my own wrongs which i shall leave
to heaven to avenge while i on earth devote myself to yours
cardenios words completed the astonishment of dorothea and not knowing
how to return thanks for such an offer she attempted to kiss his feet
but cardenio would not permit it and the licentiate replied for both
commended the sound reasoning of cardenio and lastly begged advised
and urged them to come with him to his village where they might furnish
themselves with what they needed and take measures to discover don
fernando or restore dorothea to her parents or do what seemed to them
most advisable cardenio and dorothea thanked him and accepted the kind
offer he made them and the barber who had been listening to all
attentively and in silence on his part some kindly words also and with
no less good will than the curate offered his services in any way that
might be of use to them he also explained to them in a few words the
object that had brought them there and the strange nature of don
quixotes madness and how they were waiting for his squire who had gone
in search of him like the recollection of a dream the quarrel he had
had with don quixote came back to cardenios memory and he described it
to the others but he was unable to say what the dispute was about
at this moment they heard a shout and recognised it as coming from
sancho panza who not finding them where he had left them was calling
aloud to them they went to meet him and in answer to their inquiries
about don quixote he told them how he had found him stripped to his
shirt lank yellow half dead with hunger and sighing for his lady
dulcinea and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit
that place and come to el toboso where she was expecting him he had
answered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her
beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour and if
this went on sancho said he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as
in duty bound or even an archbishop which was the least he could be
for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him
away from there the licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy for
they would fetch him away in spite of himself he then told cardenio and
dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure don quixote or at any rate
take him home upon which dorothea said that she could play the
distressed damsel better than the barber especially as she had there the
dress in which to do it to the life and that they might trust to her
acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their
scheme for she had read a great many books of chivalry and knew exactly
the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights errant
in that case said the curate there is nothing more required than to
set about it at once for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in
our favour since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your
relief and smoothed the way for us to our object
dorothea then took out of her pillow case a complete petticoat of some
rich stuff and a green mantle of some other fine material and a
necklace and other ornaments out of a little box and with these in an
instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich
lady all this and more she said she had taken from home in case of
need but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it they
were all highly delighted with her grace air and beauty and declared
don fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such
charms but the one who admired her most was sancho panza for it seemed
to him what indeed was true that in all the days of his life he had
never seen such a lovely creature and he asked the curate with great
eagerness who this beautiful lady was and what she wanted in these
this fair lady brother sancho replied the curate is no less a
personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom
of micomicon who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him
which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done
her and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired
far and wide this princess has come from guinea to seek him
a lucky seeking and a lucky finding said sancho panza at this
especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury and
right that wrong and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship
speaks of as kill him he will if he meets him unless indeed he
happens to be a phantom for my master has no power at all against
phantoms but one thing among others i would beg of you senor
licentiate which is that to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an
archbishop for that is what im afraid of your worship would recommend
him to marry this princess at once for in this way he will be disabled
from taking archbishops orders and will easily come into his empire
and i to the end of my desires i have been thinking over the matter
carefully and by what i can make out i find it will not do for me that
my master should become an archbishop because i am no good for the
church as i am married and for me now having as i have a wife and
children to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a
place of profit under the church would be endless work so that senor
it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once for as yet i do not
know her grace and so i cannot call her by her name
she is called the princess micomicona said the curate for as her
kingdom is micomicon it is clear that must be her name
theres no doubt of that replied sancho for i have known many to
take their name and title from the place where they were born and call
themselves pedro of alcala juan of ubeda and diego of valladolid and
it may be that over there in guinea queens have the same way of taking
so it may said the curate and as for your masters marrying i will
do all in my power towards it with which sancho was as much pleased as
the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the
absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy for he had evidently
persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor
by this time dorothea had seated herself upon the curates mule and the
barber had fitted the ox tail beard to his face and they now told sancho
to conduct them to where don quixote was warning him not to say that he
knew either the licentiate or the barber as his masters becoming an
emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them neither the curate
nor cardenio however thought fit to go with them cardenio lest he
should remind don quixote of the quarrel he had with him and the curate
as there was no necessity for his presence just yet so they allowed the
others to go on before them while they themselves followed slowly on
foot the curate did not forget to instruct dorothea how to act but she
said they might make their minds easy as everything would be done
exactly as the books of chivalry required and described
they had gone about three quarters of a league when they discovered don
quixote in a wilderness of rocks by this time clothed but without his
armour and as soon as dorothea saw him and was told by sancho that that
was don quixote she whipped her palfrey the well bearded barber
following her and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule
and came forward to receive her in his arms and she dismounting with
great ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of don quixote
and though he strove to raise her up she without rising addressed him in
from this spot i will not rise valiant and doughty knight until your
goodness and courtesy grant me a boon which will redound to the honour
and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate
and afflicted damsel the sun has seen and if the might of your strong
arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame you are bound to aid
the helpless being who led by the savour of your renowned name hath
come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes
i will not answer a word beauteous lady replied don quixote nor
will i listen to anything further concerning you until you rise from the
i will not rise senor answered the afflicted damsel unless of your
courtesy the boon i ask is first granted me
i grant and accord it said don quixote provided without detriment or
prejudice to my king my country or her who holds the key of my heart
it will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them my worthy
lord said the afflicted damsel and here sancho panza drew close to his
masters ear and said to him very softly your worship may very safely
grant the boon she asks its nothing at all only to kill a big giant
and she who asks it is the exalted princess micomicona queen of the
let her be who she may replied don quixote i will do what is my
bounden duty and what my conscience bids me in conformity with what i
have professed and turning to the damsel he said let your great
beauty rise for i grant the boon which you would ask of me
then what i ask said the damsel is that your magnanimous person
accompany me at once whither i will conduct you and that you promise not
to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a
traitor who against all human and divine law has usurped my kingdom
i repeat that i grant it replied don quixote and so lady you may
from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you and let
your failing hopes gather new life and strength for with the help of god
and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom and
seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm notwithstanding
and despite of the felons who would gainsay it and now hands to the
work for in delay there is apt to be danger
the distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands but
don quixote who was in all things a polished and courteous knight would
by no means allow it but made her rise and embraced her with great
courtesy and politeness and ordered sancho to look to rocinantes
girths and to arm him without a moments delay sancho took down the
armour which was hung up on a tree like a trophy and having seen to the
girths armed his master in a trice who as soon as he found himself in
let us be gone in the name of god to bring aid to this great lady
the barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his
laughter and not let his beard fall for had it fallen maybe their fine
scheme would have come to nothing but now seeing the boon granted and
the promptitude with which don quixote prepared to set out in compliance
with it he rose and took his ladys hand and between them they placed
her upon the mule don quixote then mounted rocinante and the barber
settled himself on his beast sancho being left to go on foot which made
him feel anew the loss of his dapple finding the want of him now but he
bore all with cheerfulness being persuaded that his master had now
fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor for he
felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess and be king of
micomicon at least the only thing that troubled him was the reflection
that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks and that the people they
would give him for vassals would be all black but for this he soon found
a remedy in his fancy and said he to himself what is it to me if my
vassals are blacks what more have i to do than make a cargo of them and
carry them to spain where i can sell them and get ready money for them
and with it buy some title or some office in which to live at ease all
the days of my life not unless you go to sleep and havent the wit or
skill to turn things to account and sell three six or ten thousand
vassals while you would be talking about it by god i will stir them up
big and little or as best i can and let them be ever so black ill turn
them into white or yellow come come what a fool i am and so he
jogged on so occupied with his thoughts and easy in his mind that he
forgot all about the hardship of travelling on foot
cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes
not knowing how to join company with the others but the curate who was
very fertile in devices soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose
and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off
cardenios beard and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him
a black cloak leaving himself in his breeches and doublet while
cardenios appearance was so different from what it had been that he
would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror having
effected this although the others had gone on ahead while they were
disguising themselves they easily came out on the high road before them
for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those
on horseback to go as fast as those on foot they then posted themselves
on the level ground at the outlet of the sierra and as soon as don
quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate began to examine
him very deliberately as though he were striving to recognise him and
after having stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with
open arms exclaiming a happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry my
worthy compatriot don quixote of la mancha the flower and cream of high
breeding the protection and relief of the distressed the quintessence
of knights errant and so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of don
quixotes left leg he astonished at the strangers words and behaviour
looked at him attentively and at length recognised him very much
surprised to see him there and made great efforts to dismount this
however the curate would not allow on which don quixote said permit
me senor licentiate for it is not fitting that i should be on horseback
and so reverend a person as your worship on foot
on no account will i allow it said the curate your mightiness must
remain on horseback for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest
deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age as for me an
unworthy priest it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of
one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship if they
have no objection and i will fancy i am mounted on the steed pegasus or
on the zebra or charger that bore the famous moor muzaraque who to this
day lies enchanted in the great hill of zulema a little distance from
nor even that will i consent to senor licentiate answered don
quixote and i know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the
princess out of love for me to order her squire to give up the saddle
of his mule to your worship and he can sit behind if the beast will bear
it will i am sure said the princess and i am sure too that i need
not order my squire for he is too courteous and considerate to allow a
churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted
that he is said the barber and at once alighting he offered his
saddle to the curate who accepted it without much entreaty but
unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind the mule being as it
happened a hired one which is the same thing as saying ill conditioned
lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air which
would have made master nicholas wish his expedition in quest of don
quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head as it
was they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground giving so
little heed to his beard that it fell off and all he could do when he
found himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his
hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out don quixote when he saw
all that bundle of beard detached without jaws or blood from the face
by the living god but this is a great miracle it has knocked off and
plucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off
the curate seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme at
once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where master nicholas
lay still uttering moans and drawing his head to his breast had it on
in an instant muttering over him some words which he said were a certain
special charm for sticking on beards as they would see and as soon as
he had it fixed he left him and the squire appeared well bearded and
whole as before whereat don quixote was beyond measure astonished and
begged the curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity as
he was persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards
for it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh
must have remained torn and lacerated and when it could heal all that it
and so it is said the curate and he promised to teach it to him on
the first opportunity they then agreed that for the present the curate
should mount and that the three should ride by turns until they reached
the inn which might be about six leagues from where they were
three then being mounted that is to say don quixote the princess and
the curate and three on foot cardenio the barber and sancho panza
let your highness lady lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you
but before she could answer the licentiate said
towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course is it
perchance towards that of micomicon it must be or else i know little
she being ready on all points understood that she was to answer yes
so she said yes senor my way lies towards that kingdom
in that case said the curate we must pass right through my village
and there your worship will take the road to cartagena where you will be
able to embark fortune favouring and if the wind be fair and the sea
smooth and tranquil in somewhat less than nine years you may come in
sight of the great lake meona i mean meotides which is little more than
a hundred days journey this side of your highnesss kingdom
your worship is mistaken senor said she for it is not two years
since i set out from it and though i never had good weather
nevertheless i am here to behold what i so longed for and that is my
lord don quixote of la mancha whose fame came to my ears as soon as i
set foot in spain and impelled me to go in search of him to commend
myself to his courtesy and entrust the justice of my cause to the might
enough no more praise said don quixote at this for i hate all
flattery and though this may not be so still language of the kind is
offensive to my chaste ears i will only say senora that whether it has
might or not that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your
service even to death and now leaving this to its proper season i
would ask the senor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him
into these parts alone unattended and so lightly clad that i am filled
i will answer that briefly replied the curate you must know then
senor don quixote that master nicholas our friend and barber and i
were going to seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who
went to the indies many years ago had sent me and not such a small sum
but that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight full weight which
is something and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by
four footpads who stripped us even to our beards and them they stripped
off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one and even
this young man here pointing to cardenio they completely transformed
but the best of it is the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who
attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who they say were set
free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that in spite
of the commissary and of the guards he released the whole of them and
beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses or he must be as
great a scoundrel as they or some man without heart or conscience to let
the wolf loose among the sheep the fox among the hens the fly among the
honey he has defrauded justice and opposed his king and lawful master
for he opposed his just commands he has i say robbed the galleys of
their feet stirred up the holy brotherhood which for many years past has
been quiet and lastly has done a deed by which his soul may be lost
without any gain to his body sancho had told the curate and the barber
of the adventure of the galley slaves which so much to his glory his
master had achieved and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most
of it to see what would be said or done by don quixote who changed
colour at every word not daring to say that it was he who had been the
liberator of those worthy people these then said the curate were
they who robbed us and god in his mercy pardon him who would not let
which treats of address displayed by the fair dorothea with other
the curate had hardly ceased speaking when sancho said in faith then
senor licentiate he who did that deed was my master and it was not for
want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was
about and that it was a sin to set them at liberty as they were all on
the march there because they were special scoundrels
blockhead said don quixote at this it is no business or concern of
knights errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction in chains
or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer
as they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes it
only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help having regard
to their sufferings and not to their rascalities i encountered a chaplet
or string of miserable and unfortunate people and did for them what my
sense of duty demands of me and as for the rest be that as it may and
whoever takes objection to it saving the sacred dignity of the senor
licentiate and his honoured person i say he knows little about chivalry
and lies like a whoreson villain and this i will give him to know to the
fullest extent with my sword and so saying he settled himself in his
stirrups and pressed down his morion for the barbers basin which
according to him was mambrinos helmet he carried hanging at the
saddle bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley
dorothea who was shrewd and sprightly and by this time thoroughly
understood don quixotes crazy turn and that all except sancho panza
were making game of him not to be behind the rest said to him on
observing his irritation sir knight remember the boon you have
promised me and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any
other adventure be it ever so pressing calm yourself for if the
licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that
unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over or even
bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that
that i swear heartily said the curate and i would have even plucked
i will hold my peace senora said don quixote and i will curb the
natural anger that had arisen in my breast and will proceed in peace and
quietness until i have fulfilled my promise but in return for this
consideration i entreat you to tell me if you have no objection to do
so what is the nature of your trouble and how many who and what are
the persons of whom i am to require due satisfaction and on whom i am to
that i will do with all my heart replied dorothea if it will not be
wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes
it will not be wearisome senora said don quixote to which dorothea
replied well if that be so give me your attention as soon as she
said this cardenio and the barber drew close to her side eager to hear
what sort of story the quick witted dorothea would invent for herself
and sancho did the same for he was as much taken in by her as his
master and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle and
with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think
began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion
first of all i would have you know sirs that my name is  and here
she stopped for a moment for she forgot the name the curate had given
her but he came to her relief seeing what her difficulty was and said
it is no wonder senora that your highness should be confused and
embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes for such afflictions
often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory so that they
do not even remember their own names as is the case now with your
ladyship who has forgotten that she is called the princess micomicona
lawful heiress of the great kingdom of micomicon and with this cue your
highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection all you may wish
that is the truth said the damsel but i think from this on i shall
have no need of any prompting and i shall bring my true story safe into
port and here it is the king my father who was called tinacrio the
sapient was very learned in what they call magic arts and became aware
by his craft that my mother who was called queen jaramilla was to die
before he did and that soon after he too was to depart this life and i
was to be left an orphan without father or mother but all this he
declared did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge
that a prodigious giant the lord of a great island close to our kingdom
pandafilando of the scowl by name for it is averred that though his
eyes are properly placed and straight he always looks askew as if he
squinted and this he does out of malignity to strike fear and terror
into those he looks at that he knew i say that this giant on becoming
aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force
and strip me of all not leaving me even a small village to shelter me
but that i could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if i were willing to
marry him however as far as he could see he never expected that i
would consent to a marriage so unequal and he said no more than the
truth in this for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant or
any other let him be ever so great or enormous my father said too
that when he was dead and i saw pandafilando about to invade my kingdom
i was not to wait and attempt to defend myself for that would be
destructive to me but that i should leave the kingdom entirely open to
him if i wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and
loyal vassals for there would be no possibility of defending myself
against the giants devilish power and that i should at once with some
of my followers set out for spain where i should obtain relief in my
distress on finding a certain knight errant whose fame by that time would
extend over the whole kingdom and who would be called if i remember
don quixote he must have said senora observed sancho at this
otherwise called the knight of the rueful countenance
that is it said dorothea he said moreover that he would be tall of
stature and lank featured and that on his right side under the left
shoulder or thereabouts he would have a grey mole with hairs like
on hearing this don quixote said to his squire here sancho my son
bear a hand and help me to strip for i want to see if i am the knight
what does your worship want to strip for said dorothea
to see if i have that mole your father spoke of answered don quixote
there is no occasion to strip said sancho for i know your worship
has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone which is the mark of
that is enough said dorothea for with friends we must not look too
closely into trifles and whether it be on the shoulder or on the
backbone matters little it is enough if there is a mole be it where it
may for it is all the same flesh no doubt my good father hit the truth
in every particular and i have made a lucky hit in commending myself to
don quixote for he is the one my father spoke of as the features of his
countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide
fame he has acquired not only in spain but in all la mancha for i had
scarcely landed at osuna when i heard such accounts of his achievements
that at once my heart told me he was the very one i had come in search
but how did you land at osuna senora asked don quixote when it is
but before dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her saying the
princess meant to say that after she had landed at malaga the first place
where she heard of your worship was osuna
that is what i meant to say said dorothea
and that would be only natural said the curate will your majesty
there is no more to add said dorothea save that in finding don
quixote i have had such good fortune that i already reckon and regard
myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions since of his courtesy
and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me
whithersoever i may conduct him which will be only to bring him face to
face with pandafilando of the scowl that he may slay him and restore to
me what has been unjustly usurped by him for all this must come to pass
satisfactorily since my good father tinacrio the sapient foretold it who
likewise left it declared in writing in chaldee or greek characters for
i cannot read them that if this predicted knight after having cut the
giants throat should be disposed to marry me i was to offer myself at
once without demur as his lawful wife and yield him possession of my
what thinkest thou now friend sancho said don quixote at this
hearest thou that did i not tell thee so see how we have already got a
kingdom to govern and a queen to marry
on my oath it is so said sancho and foul fortune to him who wont
marry after slitting senor pandahilados windpipe and then how
ill favoured the queen is i wish the fleas in my bed were that sort
and so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of
extreme satisfaction and then ran to seize the bridle of dorotheas
mule and checking it fell on his knees before her begging her to give
him her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen
and mistress which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see
the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant dorothea
therefore gave her hand and promised to make him a great lord in her
kingdom when heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and
enjoy it for which sancho returned thanks in words that set them all
this sirs continued dorothea is my story it only remains to tell
you that of all the attendants i took with me from my kingdom i have none
left except this well bearded squire for all were drowned in a great
tempest we encountered when in sight of port and he and i came to land
on a couple of planks as if by a miracle and indeed the whole course of
my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed and if i
have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as i ought let it
be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale
that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their
they shall not deprive me of mine exalted and worthy princess said
don quixote however great and unexampled those which i shall endure in
your service may be and here i confirm anew the boon i have promised
you and i swear to go with you to the end of the world until i find
myself in the presence of your fierce enemy whose haughty head i trust
by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this i will not say
good sword thanks to gines de pasamonte who carried away mine this he
said between his teeth and then continued and when it has been cut
off and you have been put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall
be left to your own decision to dispose of your person as may be most
pleasing to you for so long as my memory is occupied my will enslaved
and my understanding enthralled by her i say no more it is impossible
for me for a moment to contemplate marriage even with a phoenix
the last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so
disagreeable to sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great
by my oath senor don quixote you are not in your right senses for how
can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as
this do you think fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece
of luck as is offered you now is my lady dulcinea fairer perchance not
she nor half as fair and i will even go so far as to say she does not
come up to the shoe of this one here a poor chance i have of getting
that county i am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in
the bottom of the sea in the devils name marry marry and take this
kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble and when you are king
make me a marquis or governor of a province and for the rest let the
don quixote when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady
dulcinea could not endure it and lifting his pike without saying
anything to sancho or uttering a word he gave him two such thwacks that
he brought him to the ground and had it not been that dorothea cried out
to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot
do you think he said to him after a pause you scurvy clown that you
are to be always interfering with me and that you are to be always
offending and i always pardoning dont fancy it impious scoundrel for
that beyond a doubt thou art since thou hast set thy tongue going
against the peerless dulcinea know you not lout vagabond beggar that
were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm i should not have
strength enough to kill a flea say scoffer with a vipers tongue what
think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giants head and made you
a marquis for all this i count as already accomplished and decided but
the might of dulcinea employing my arm as the instrument of her
achievements she fights in me and conquers in me and i live and breathe
in her and owe my life and being to her o whoreson scoundrel how
ungrateful you are you see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to
be a titled lord and the return you make for so great a benefit is to
speak evil of her who has conferred it upon you
sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said and
rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind
dorotheas palfrey and from that position he said to his master
tell me senor if your worship is resolved not to marry this great
princess it is plain the kingdom will not be yours and not being so
how can you bestow favours upon me that is what i complain of let your
worship at any rate marry this queen now that we have got her here as if
showered down from heaven and afterwards you may go back to my lady
dulcinea for there must have been kings in the world who kept
mistresses as to beauty i have nothing to do with it and if the truth
is to be told i like them both though i have never seen the lady
how never seen her blasphemous traitor exclaimed don quixote hast
thou not just now brought me a message from her
i mean said sancho that i did not see her so much at my leisure that
i could take particular notice of her beauty or of her charms piecemeal
but taken in the lump i like her
now i forgive thee said don quixote and do thou forgive me the
injury i have done thee for our first impulses are not in our control
that i see replied sancho and with me the wish to speak is always
the first impulse and i cannot help saying once at any rate what i
for all that sancho said don quixote take heed of what thou sayest
for the pitcher goes so often to the well i need say no more to thee
well well said sancho god is in heaven and sees all tricks and
will judge who does most harm i in not speaking right or your worship
that is enough said dorothea run sancho and kiss your lords hand
and beg his pardon and henceforward be more circumspect with your praise
and abuse and say nothing in disparagement of that lady toboso of whom
i know nothing save that i am her servant and put your trust in god for
you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince
sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his masters hand which don
quixote with dignity presented to him giving him his blessing as soon as
he had kissed it he then bade him go on ahead a little as he had
questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him
sancho obeyed and when the two had gone some distance in advance don
quixote said to him since thy return i have had no opportunity or time
to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou
hast brought back and now that chance has granted us the time and
opportunity deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good
let your worship ask what you will answered sancho for i shall find
a way out of all as as i found a way in but i implore you senor not
why dost thou say that sancho said don quixote
i say it he returned because those blows just now were more because
of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night than
for what i said against my lady dulcinea whom i love and reverence as i
would a relic though there is nothing of that about her merely as
say no more on that subject for thy life sancho said don quixote
for it is displeasing to me i have already pardoned thee for that and
thou knowest the common saying for a fresh sin a fresh penance
while this was going on they saw coming along the road they were
following a man mounted on an ass who when he came close seemed to be a
gipsy but sancho panza whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw
asses no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be gines de
pasamonte and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball his ass
for it was in fact dapple that carried pasamonte who to escape
recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy being
able to speak the gipsy language and many more as well as if they were
his own sancho saw him and recognised him and the instant he did so he
shouted to him ginesillo you thief give up my treasure release my
life embarrass thyself not with my repose quit my ass leave my
delight be off rip get thee gone thief and give up what is not
there was no necessity for so many words or objurgations for at the
first one gines jumped down and at a like racing speed made off and got
clear of them all sancho hastened to his dapple and embracing him he
said how hast thou fared my blessing dapple of my eyes my comrade
all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being
the ass held his peace and let himself be kissed and caressed by sancho
without answering a single word they all came up and congratulated him
on having found dapple don quixote especially who told him that
notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for the three
while the two had been going along conversing in this fashion the curate
observed to dorothea that she had shown great cleverness as well in the
story itself as in its conciseness and the resemblance it bore to those
of the books of chivalry she said that she had many times amused herself
reading them but that she did not know the situation of the provinces or
seaports and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at osuna
so i saw said the curate and for that reason i made haste to say
what i did by which it was all set right but is it not a strange thing
to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and
lies simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities
so it is said cardenio and so uncommon and unexampled that were one
to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction i doubt if there be any
but another strange thing about it said the curate is that apart
from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with
his craze when other subjects are dealt with he can discuss them in a
perfectly rational manner showing that his mind is quite clear and
composed so that provided his chivalry is not touched upon no one
would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound
while they were holding this conversation don quixote continued his with
friend panza let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels and tell me
now dismissing anger and irritation where how and when didst thou
find dulcinea what was she doing what didst thou say to her what did
she answer how did she look when she was reading my letter who copied
it out for thee and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth
knowing asking and learning neither adding nor falsifying to give me
pleasure nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it
senor replied sancho if the truth is to be told nobody copied out
the letter for me for i carried no letter at all
it is as thou sayest said don quixote for the note book in which i
wrote it i found in my own possession two days after thy departure which
gave me very great vexation as i knew not what thou wouldst do on
finding thyself without any letter and i made sure thou wouldst return
from the place where thou didst first miss it
so i should have done said sancho if i had not got it by heart when
your worship read it to me so that i repeated it to a sacristan who
copied it out for me from hearing it so exactly that he said in all the
days of his life though he had read many a letter of excommunication he
had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that
and hast thou got it still in thy memory sancho said don quixote
no senor replied sancho for as soon as i had repeated it seeing
there was no further use for it i set about forgetting it and if i
recollect any of it it is that about scrubbingi mean to say
sovereign lady and the end yours till death the knight of the rueful
countenance and between these two i put into it more than three hundred
my souls and my lifes and my eyes
of the delectable discussion between don quixote and sancho panza his
all that is not unsatisfactory to me said don quixote go on thou
didst reach her and what was that queen of beauty doing surely thou
didst find her stringing pearls or embroidering some device in gold
