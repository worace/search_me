of the resolution don quixote formed to turn shepherd and take to a life
in the fields while the year for which he had given his word was running
its course with other events truly delectable and happy
if a multitude of reflections used to harass don quixote before he had
been overthrown a great many more harassed him since his fall he was
under the shade of a tree as has been said and there like flies on
honey thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him some of them
turned upon the disenchantment of dulcinea others upon the life he was
about to lead in his enforced retirement sancho came up and spoke in
high praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey tosilos
is it possible sancho said don quixote that thou dost still think
that he yonder is a real lacquey apparently it has escaped thy memory
that thou hast seen dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant wench
and the knight of the mirrors into the bachelor carrasco all the work of
the enchanters that persecute me but tell me now didst thou ask this
tosilos as thou callest him what has become of altisidora did she weep
over my absence or has she already consigned to oblivion the love
thoughts that used to afflict her when i was present
the thoughts that i had said sancho were not such as to leave time
for asking fools questions body o me senor is your worship in a
condition now to inquire into other peoples thoughts above all love
look ye sancho said don quixote there is a great difference between
what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude a knight may
very possibly be proof against love but it is impossible strictly
speaking for him to be ungrateful altisidora to all appearance loved
me truly she gave me the three kerchiefs thou knowest of she wept at my
departure she cursed me she abused me casting shame to the winds she
bewailed herself in public all signs that she adored me for the wrath
of lovers always ends in curses i had no hopes to give her nor
treasures to offer her for mine are given to dulcinea and the treasures
of knights errant are like those of the fairies illusory and deceptive
all i can give her is the place in my memory i keep for her without
prejudice however to that which i hold devoted to dulcinea whom thou
art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that
flesh would that i saw it eaten by wolves which would rather keep
itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady
senor replied sancho if the truth is to be told i cannot persuade
myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the
disenchantment of the enchanted it is like saying if your head aches
rub ointment on your knees at any rate ill make bold to swear that in
all the histories dealing with knight errantry that your worship has read
you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping but whether
or no ill whip myself when i have a fancy for it and the opportunity
god grant it said don quixote and heaven give thee grace to take it
to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady who is
as they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very
same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls don quixote
recognised it and said he to sancho this is the meadow where we came
upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to
revive and imitate the pastoral arcadia there an idea as novel as it was
happy in emulation whereof if so be thou dost approve of it sancho i
would have ourselves turn shepherds at any rate for the time i have to
live in retirement i will buy some ewes and everything else requisite
for the pastoral calling and i under the name of the shepherd quixotize
and thou as the shepherd panzino we will roam the woods and groves and
meadows singing songs here lamenting in elegies there drinking of the
crystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers the
oaks will yield us their sweet fruit with bountiful hand the trunks of
the hard cork trees a seat the willows shade the roses perfume the
widespread meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes the clear pure
air will give us breath the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the
night for us song shall be our delight lamenting our joy apollo will
supply us with verses and love with conceits whereby we shall make
ourselves famed for ever not only in this but in ages to come
egad said sancho but that sort of life squares nay corners with my
notions and what is more the bachelor samson carrasco and master
nicholas the barber wont have well seen it before theyll want to follow
it and turn shepherds along with us and god grant it may not come into
the curates head to join the sheepfold too hes so jovial and fond of
thou art in the right of it sancho said don quixote and the
bachelor samson carrasco if he enters the pastoral fraternity as no
doubt he will may call himself the shepherd samsonino or perhaps the
shepherd carrascon nicholas the barber may call himself niculoso as old
boscan formerly was called nemoroso as for the curate i dont know what
name we can fit to him unless it be something derived from his title and
we call him the shepherd curiambro for the shepherdesses whose lovers we
shall be we can pick names as we would pears and as my ladys name does
just as well for a shepherdesss as for a princesss i need not trouble
myself to look for one that will suit her better to thine sancho thou
i dont mean to give her any but teresona said sancho which will go
well with her stoutness and with her own right name as she is called
teresa and then when i sing her praises in my verses ill show how
chaste my passion is for im not going to look for better bread than
ever came from wheat in other mens houses it wont do for the curate
to have a shepherdess for the sake of good example and if the bachelor
chooses to have one that is his look out
god bless me sancho my friend said don quixote what a life we shall
lead what hautboys and zamora bagpipes we shall hear what tabors
timbrels and rebecks and then if among all these different sorts of
music that of the albogues is heard almost all the pastoral instruments
what are albogues asked sancho for i never in my life heard tell of
albogues said don quixote are brass plates like candlesticks that
struck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which if not
very pleasing or harmonious is not disagreeable and accords very well
with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor the word albogue is
morisco as are all those in our spanish tongue that begin with al for
alcancia and others of the same sort of which there are not many more
our language has only three that are morisco and end in i which are
borcegui zaquizami and maravedi alheli and alfaqui are seen to be
arabic as well by the al at the beginning as by the they end with i
mention this incidentally the chance allusion to albogues having
reminded me of it and it will be of great assistance to us in the
perfect practice of this calling that i am something of a poet as thou
knowest and that besides the bachelor samson carrasco is an accomplished
one of the curate i say nothing but i will wager he has some spice of
the poet in him and no doubt master nicholas too for all barbers or
most of them are guitar players and stringers of verses i will bewail
my separation thou shalt glorify thyself as a constant lover the
shepherd carrascon will figure as a rejected one and the curate
curiambro as whatever may please him best and so all will go as gaily as
to this sancho made answer i am so unlucky senor that im afraid the
day will never come when ill see myself at such a calling o what neat
spoons ill make when im a shepherd what messes creams garlands
pastoral odds and ends and if they dont get me a name for wisdom
theyll not fail to get me one for ingenuity my daughter sanchica will
bring us our dinner to the pasture but stay shes good looking and
shepherds there are with more mischief than simplicity in them i would
not have her come for wool and go back shorn love making and lawless
desires are just as common in the fields as in the cities and in
shepherds shanties as in royal palaces do away with the cause you do
away with the sin if eyes dont see hearts dont break and better a
a truce to thy proverbs sancho exclaimed don quixote any one of
those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning many a time
have i recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to exercise
some moderation in delivering them but it seems to me it is only
preaching in the desert my mother beats me and i go on with my
it seems to me said sancho that your worship is like the common
saying said the frying pan to the kettle get away blackbreech you
chide me for uttering proverbs and you string them in couples yourself
observe sancho replied don quixote i bring in proverbs to the
purpose and when i quote them they fit like a ring to the finger thou
bringest them in by the head and shoulders in such a way that thou dost
drag them in rather than introduce them if i am not mistaken i have
told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from the
experience and observation of our wise men of old but the proverb that
is not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim but enough
of this as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some little distance
from the high road to pass the night what is in store for us to morrow
they turned aside and supped late and poorly very much against sanchos
will who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant upon
knight errantry in woods and forests even though at times plenty
presented itself in castles and houses as at don diego de mirandas at
the wedding of camacho the rich and at don antonio morenos he
reflected however that it could not be always day nor always night
and so that night he passed in sleeping and his master in waking
of the bristly adventure that befell don quixote
the night was somewhat dark for though there was a moon in the sky it
was not in a quarter where she could be seen for sometimes the lady
diana goes on a stroll to the antipodes and leaves the mountains all
black and the valleys in darkness don quixote obeyed nature so far as to
sleep his first sleep but did not give way to the second very different
from sancho who never had any second because with him sleep lasted from
night till morning wherein he showed what a sound constitution and few
cares he had don quixotes cares kept him restless so much so that he
awoke sancho and said to him i am amazed sancho at the unconcern of
thy temperament i believe thou art made of marble or hard brass
incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever i lie awake while thou
sleepest i weep while thou singest i am faint with fasting while thou
art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion it is the duty of good
servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters
if it be only for the sake of appearances see the calmness of the night
the solitude of the spot inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of
some sort rise as thou livest and retire a little distance and with a
good heart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes
on account of dulcineas disenchantment score and this i entreat of
thee making it a request for i have no desire to come to grips with
thee a second time as i know thou hast a heavy hand as soon as thou
hast laid them on we will pass the rest of the night i singing my
separation thou thy constancy making a beginning at once with the
pastoral life we are to follow at our village
senor replied sancho im no monk to get up out of the middle of my
sleep and scourge myself nor does it seem to me that one can pass from
one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music will your
worship let me sleep and not worry me about whipping myself or youll
make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet not to say my flesh
o hard heart said don quixote o pitiless squire o bread
ill bestowed and favours ill acknowledged both those i have done thee
and those i mean to do thee through me hast thou seen thyself a
governor and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of
being a count or obtaining some other equivalent title for i post
i dont know what that is said sancho all i know is that so long as
i am asleep i have neither fear nor hope trouble nor glory and good
luck betide him that invented sleep the cloak that covers over all a
mans thoughts the food that removes hunger the drink that drives away
thirst the fire that warms the cold the cold that tempers the heat
and to wind up with the universal coin wherewith everything is bought
the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal with the king and
the fool with the wise man sleep i have heard say has only one fault
that it is like death for between a sleeping man and a dead man there is
never have i heard thee speak so elegantly as now sancho said don
quixote and here i begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost
sometimes quote not with whom thou art bred but with whom thou art
ha by my life master mine said sancho its not i that am stringing
proverbs now for they drop in pairs from your worships mouth faster
than from mine only there is this difference between mine and yours
that yours are well timed and mine are untimely but anyhow they are all
at this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed
to spread through all the valleys around don quixote stood up and laid
his hand upon his sword and sancho ensconced himself under dapple and
put the bundle of armour on one side of him and the asss pack saddle on
the other in fear and trembling as great as don quixotes perturbation
each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified
men or at least to one for as to the other his courage is known to
all the fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six
hundred pigs to sell at a fair and were on their way with them at that
hour and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and
blowing that they deafened the ears of don quixote and sancho panza and
they could not make out what it was the wide spread grunting drove came
on in a surging mass and without showing any respect for don quixotes
dignity or sanchos passed right over the pair of them demolishing
sanchos entrenchments and not only upsetting don quixote but sweeping
rocinante off his feet into the bargain and what with the trampling and
the grunting and the pace at which the unclean beasts went pack saddle
armour dapple and rocinante were left scattered on the ground and sancho
sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his
sword saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly
pigs for he had by this time found out that that was what they were
let them be my friend said don quixote this insult is the penalty
of my sin and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals
should devour a vanquished knight and wasps sting him and pigs trample
i suppose it is the chastisement of heaven too said sancho that
flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights and lice eat them
and hunger assail them if we squires were the sons of the knights we
serve or their very near relations it would be no wonder if the penalty
of their misdeeds overtook us even to the fourth generation but what
have the panzas to do with the quixotes well well lets lie down again
and sleep out what little of the night theres left and god will send us
sleep thou sancho returned don quixote for thou wast born to sleep
as i was born to watch and during the time it now wants of dawn i will
give a loose rein to my thoughts and seek a vent for them in a little
madrigal which unknown to thee i composed in my head last night
i should think said sancho that the thoughts that allow one to make
verses cannot be of great consequence let your worship string verses as
much as you like and ill sleep as much as i can and forthwith taking
the space of ground he required he muffled himself up and fell into a
sound sleep undisturbed by bond debt or trouble of any sort don
quixote propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork tree for cide
hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was sang in this strain to
in hope therein the end of all to find
that welcome haven in my sea of woe
that life revives and still i linger here
that deals with life and death as with a play
he accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears just like
one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separation
and now daylight came and the sun smote sancho on the eyes with his
beams he awoke roused himself up shook himself and stretched his lazy
limbs and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed
the drove and more besides then the pair resumed their journey and as
evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback
and four or five on foot don quixotes heart beat quick and sanchos
quailed with fear for the persons approaching them carried lances and
bucklers and were in very warlike guise don quixote turned to sancho
and said if i could make use of my weapons and my promise had not tied
my hands i would count this host that comes against us but cakes and
fancy bread but perhaps it may prove something different from what we
apprehend the men on horseback now came up and raising their lances
surrounded don quixote in silence and pointed them at his back and
breast menacing him with death one of those on foot putting his finger
to his lips as a sign to him to be silent seized rocinantes bridle and
drew him out of the road and the others driving sancho and dapple before
them and all maintaining a strange silence followed in the steps of the
one who led don quixote the latter two or three times attempted to ask
where they were taking him to and what they wanted but the instant he
began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of
their lances and sancho fared the same way for the moment he seemed
about to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad and dapple
likewise as if he too wanted to talk night set in they quickened their
pace and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater especially as they
heard themselves assailed with get on ye troglodytes silence ye
barbarians march ye cannibals no murmuring ye scythians dont
open your eyes ye murderous polyphemes ye blood thirsty lions and
suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched
master and man sancho went along saying to himself we tortolites
barbers animals i dont like those names at all its in a bad wind
our corn is being winnowed misfortune comes upon us all at once like
sticks on a dog and god grant it may be no worse than them that this
don quixote rode completely dazed unable with the aid of all his wits to
make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called
them and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no
good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared and now about an hour
after midnight they reached a castle which don quixote saw at once was
the dukes where they had been but a short time before god bless me
said he as he recognised the mansion what does this mean it is all
courtesy and politeness in this house but with the vanquished good turns
they entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and
fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their
fears as will be seen in the following chapter
of the strangest and most extraordinary adventure that befell don quixote
in the whole course of this great history
the horsemen dismounted and together with the men on foot without a
moments delay taking up sancho and don quixote bodily they carried them
into the court all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets
were burning besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors so that
in spite of the night which was somewhat dark the want of daylight
could not be perceived in the middle of the court was a catafalque
raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an
immense canopy of black velvet and on the steps all round it white wax
tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks upon the
catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her
beauty she made death itself look beautiful she lay with her head
resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of
sweet smelling flowers of divers sorts her hands crossed upon her bosom
and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory on one side of the
court was erected a stage where upon two chairs were seated two persons
who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres in their hands
appeared to be kings of some sort whether real or mock ones by the side
of this stage which was reached by steps were two other chairs on which
the men carrying the prisoners seated don quixote and sancho all in
silence and by signs giving them to understand that they too were to be
silent which however they would have been without any signs for their
amazement at all they saw held them tongue tied and now two persons of
distinction who were at once recognised by don quixote as his hosts the
duke and duchess ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite and
seated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings as they
seemed to be who would not have been amazed at this nor was this all
for don quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was
that of the fair altisidora as the duke and duchess mounted the stage
don quixote and sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance which
they returned by bowing their heads slightly at this moment an official
crossed over and approaching sancho threw over him a robe of black
buckram painted all over with flames of fire and taking off his cap put
upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the holy
office wear and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips or
they would put a gag upon him or take his life sancho surveyed himself
from head to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames but as they did
not burn him he did not care two farthings for them he took off the
mitre and seeing painted with devils he put it on again saying to
himself well so far those dont burn me nor do these carry me off
don quixote surveyed him too and though fear had got the better of his
faculties he could not help smiling to see the figure sancho presented
and now from underneath the catafalque so it seemed there rose a low
sweet sound of flutes which coming unbroken by human voice for there
silence itself kept silence had a soft and languishing effect then
beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body suddenly appeared a
fair youth in a roman habit who to the accompaniment of a harp which he
himself played sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas
returns to life and in this magic court
the dames in sables come to grace the scene
and while her matrons all in seemly sort
her beauty and her sorrows will i sing
with defter quill than touched the thracian string
but not in life alone methinks to me
is cold in death believe me unto thee
my soul from this strait prison house set free
as oer the stygian lake it floats along
thy praises singing still shall hold its way
at this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed enough
enough divine singer it would be an endless task to put before us now
the death and the charms of the peerless altisidora not dead as the
ignorant world imagines but living in the voice of fame and in the
penance which sancho panza here present has to undergo to restore her
to the long lost light do thou therefore o rhadamanthus who sittest
in judgment with me in the murky caverns of dis as thou knowest all that
the inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this
damsel announce and declare it at once that the happiness we look
forward to from her restoration be no longer deferred
no sooner had minos the fellow judge of rhadamanthus said this than
ho officials of this house high and low great and small make haste
hither one and all and print on sanchos face four and twenty smacks
and give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms for
upon this ceremony depends the restoration of altisidora
on hearing this sancho broke silence and cried out by all thats good
ill as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn moor body o me
what has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this damsel
the old woman took kindly to the blits they enchant dulcinea and whip
me in order to disenchant her altisidora dies of ailments god was
pleased to send her and to bring her to life again they must give me
four and twenty smacks and prick holes in my body with pins and raise
weals on my arms with pinches try those jokes on a brother in law im
an old dog and tus tus is no use with me
thou shalt die said rhadamanthus in a loud voice relent thou tiger
humble thyself proud nimrod suffer and be silent for no
impossibilities are asked of thee it is not for thee to inquire into the
difficulties in this matter smacked thou must be pricked thou shalt see
thyself and with pinches thou must be made to howl ho i say
officials obey my orders or by the word of an honest man ye shall see
at this some six duennas advancing across the court made their
appearance in procession one after the other four of them with
spectacles and all with their right hands uplifted showing four fingers
of wrist to make their hands look longer as is the fashion now a days
no sooner had sancho caught sight of them than bellowing like a bull he
exclaimed i might let myself be handled by all the world but allow
duennas to touch me not a bit of it scratch my face as my master was
served in this very castle run me through the body with burnished
daggers pinch my arms with red hot pincers ill bear all in patience to
serve these gentlefolk but i wont let duennas touch me though the
here don quixote too broke silence saying to sancho have patience
my son and gratify these noble persons and give all thanks to heaven
that it has infused such virtue into thy person that by its sufferings
thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead
the duennas were now close to sancho and he having become more
tractable and reasonable settling himself well in his chair presented
his face and beard to the first who delivered him a smack very stoutly
laid on and then made him a low curtsey
less politeness and less paint senora duenna said sancho by god
in fine all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household
pinched him but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins
and so apparently out of patience he started up out of his chair and
seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the
whole set of his tormentors exclaiming begone ye ministers of hell
im not made of brass not to feel such out of the way tortures
at this instant altisidora who probably was tired of having been so long
lying on her back turned on her side seeing which the bystanders cried
out almost with one voice altisidora is alive altisidora lives
rhadamanthus bade sancho put away his wrath as the object they had in
view was now attained when don quixote saw altisidora move he went on
his knees to sancho saying to him now is the time son of my bowels
not to call thee my squire for thee to give thyself some of those lashes
thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of dulcinea now i say
is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe and endowed with
efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee
to which sancho made answer thats trick upon trick i think and not
honey upon pancakes a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now
on the top of pinches smacks and pin proddings you had better take a
big stone and tie it round my neck and pitch me into a well i should
not mind it much if im to be always made the cow of the wedding for the
cure of other peoples ailments leave me alone or else by god ill
fling the whole thing to the dogs let come what may
altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque and as she did so
the clarions sounded accompanied by the flutes and the voices of all
present exclaiming long life to altisidora long life to altisidora
the duke and duchess and the kings minos and rhadamanthus stood up and
all together with don quixote and sancho advanced to receive her and
take her down from the catafalque and she making as though she were
recovering from a swoon bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to
the kings and looking sideways at don quixote said to him god forgive
thee insensible knight for through thy cruelty i have been to me it
seems more than a thousand years in the other world and to thee the
most compassionate upon earth i render thanks for the life i am now in
possession of from this day forth friend sancho count as thine six
smocks of mine which i bestow upon thee to make as many shirts for
thyself and if they are not all quite whole at any rate they are all
sancho kissed her hands in gratitude kneeling and with the mitre in his
hand the duke bade them take it from him and give him back his cap and
doublet and remove the flaming robe sancho begged the duke to let them
leave him the robe and mitre as he wanted to take them home for a token
and memento of that unexampled adventure the duchess said they must
leave them with him for he knew already what a great friend of his she
was the duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared and that
all should retire to their chambers and that don quixote and sancho
which follows sixty nine and deals with matters indispensable for the
sancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with don quixote a
thing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very well that
with questions and answers his master would not let him sleep and he was
in no humour for talking much as he still felt the pain of his late
martyrdom which interfered with his freedom of speech and it would have
been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone than in that luxurious
chamber in company and so well founded did his apprehension prove and
so correct was his anticipation that scarcely had his master got into
bed when he said what dost thou think of tonights adventure sancho
great and mighty is the power of cold hearted scorn for thou with thine
own eyes hast seen altisidora slain not by arrows nor by the sword nor
by any warlike weapon nor by deadly poisons but by the thought of the
sternness and scorn with which i have always treated her
she might have died and welcome said sancho when she pleased and how
she pleased and she might have left me alone for i never made her fall
in love or scorned her i dont know nor can i imagine how the recovery
of altisidora a damsel more fanciful than wise can have as i have said
before anything to do with the sufferings of sancho panza now i begin
to see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters and enchanted people
in the world and may god deliver me from them since i cant deliver
myself and so i beg of your worship to let me sleep and not ask me any
more questions unless you want me to throw myself out of the window
sleep sancho my friend said don quixote if the pinprodding and
pinches thou hast received and the smacks administered to thee will let
no pain came up to the insult of the smacks said sancho for the
simple reason that it was duennas confound them that gave them to me
but once more i entreat your worship to let me sleep for sleep is relief
from misery to those who are miserable when awake
be it so and god be with thee said don quixote
they fell asleep both of them and cide hamete the author of this great
history took this opportunity to record and relate what it was that
induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been
described the bachelor samson carrasco he says not forgetting how he
as the knight of the mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by don
quixote which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans resolved to try
his hand again hoping for better luck than he had before and so having
learned where don quixote was from the page who brought the letter and
present to sanchos wife teresa panza he got himself new armour and
another horse and put a white moon upon his shield and to carry his
arms he had a mule led by a peasant not by tom cecial his former squire
for fear he should be recognised by sancho or don quixote he came to the
dukes castle and the duke informed him of the road and route don
quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at
saragossa he told him too of the jokes he had practised upon him and
of the device for the disenchantment of dulcinea at the expense of
sanchos backside and finally he gave him an account of the trick sancho
had played upon his master making him believe that dulcinea was
enchanted and turned into a country wench and of how the duchess his
wife had persuaded sancho that it was he himself who was deceived
inasmuch as dulcinea was really enchanted at which the bachelor laughed
not a little and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of
sancho as at the length to which don quixotes madness went the duke
begged of him if he found him whether he overcame him or not to return
that way and let him know the result this the bachelor did he set out
in quest of don quixote and not finding him at saragossa he went on
and how he fared has been already told he returned to the dukes castle
and told him all what the conditions of the combat were and how don
quixote was now like a loyal knight errant returning to keep his
promise of retiring to his village for a year by which time said the
bachelor he might perhaps be cured of his madness for that was the
object that had led him to adopt these disguises as it was a sad thing
for a gentleman of such good parts as don quixote to be a madman and so
he took his leave of the duke and went home to his village to wait there
for don quixote who was coming after him thereupon the duke seized the
opportunity of practising this mystification upon him so much did he
enjoy everything connected with sancho and don quixote he had the roads
about the castle far and near everywhere he thought don quixote was
likely to pass on his return occupied by large numbers of his servants
on foot and on horseback who were to bring him to the castle by fair
means or foul if they met him they did meet him and sent word to the
duke who having already settled what was to be done as soon as he
heard of his arrival ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be
lit and altisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and
ceremony that has been described the whole affair being so well arranged
and acted that it differed but little from reality and cide hamete says
moreover that for his part he considers the concocters of the joke as
crazy as the victims of it and that the duke and duchess were not two
fingers breadth removed from being something like fools themselves when
they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools
as for the latter one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake
occupied with his desultory thoughts when daylight came to them bringing
with it the desire to rise for the lazy down was never a delight to don
quixote victor or vanquished altisidora come back from death to life
as don quixote fancied following up the freak of her lord and lady
entered the chamber crowned with the garland she had worn on the
catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers
her hair flowing loose over her shoulders and leaning upon a staff of
fine black ebony don quixote disconcerted and in confusion at her
appearance huddled himself up and well nigh covered himself altogether
with the sheets and counterpane of the bed tongue tied and unable to
offer her any civility altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head
of the bed and after a deep sigh said to him in a feeble soft voice
when women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot and
give a loose to the tongue that breaks through every impediment
publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their hearts they are reduced to
sore extremities such a one am i senor don quixote of la mancha
crushed conquered love smitten but yet patient under suffering and
virtuous and so much so that my heart broke with grief and i lost my
life for the last two days i have been dead slain by the thought of the
cruelty with which thou hast treated me obdurate knight
o harder thou than marble to my plaint
or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me and had it not been
that love taking pity on me let my recovery rest upon the sufferings of
this good squire there i should have remained in the other world
love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass and
i should have been obliged to him said sancho but tell me
senora and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master what did
you see in the other world what goes on in hell for of course thats
where one who dies in despair is bound for
to tell you the truth said altisidora i cannot have died outright
for i did not go into hell had i gone in it is very certain i should
never have come out again do what i might the truth is i came to the
gate where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis all in
breeches and doublets with falling collars trimmed with flemish
bonelace and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands with
four fingers breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look
longer in their hands they held rackets of fire but what amazed me
still more was that books apparently full of wind and rubbish served
them for tennis balls a strange and marvellous thing this however did
not astonish me so much as to observe that although with players it is
usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry there in that game
all were growling all were snarling and all were cursing one another
thats no wonder said sancho for devils whether playing or not can
very likely said altisidora but there is another thing that
surprises me too i mean surprised me then and that was that no ball
outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time and it was
wonderful the constant succession there was of books new and old to one
of them a brand new well bound one they gave such a stroke that they
knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about look what
book that is said one devil to another and the other replied it is
the second part of the history of don quixote of la mancha not by cide
hamete the original author but by an aragonese who by his own account
is of tordesillas out of this with it said the first and into the
depths of hell with it out of my sight is it so bad said the other
so bad is it said the first that if i had set myself deliberately to
make a worse i could not have done it they then went on with their
game knocking other books about and i having heard them mention the
name of don quixote whom i love and adore so took care to retain this
a vision it must have been no doubt said don quixote for there is
no other i in the world this history has been going about here for some
time from hand to hand but it does not stay long in any for everybody
gives it a taste of his foot i am not disturbed by hearing that i am
wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or in the
daylight above for i am not the one that history treats of if it should
be good faithful and true it will have ages of life but if it should
be bad from its birth to its burial will not be a very long journey
altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against don quixote
when he said to her i have several times told you senora that it
grieves me you should have set your affections upon me as from mine they
can only receive gratitude but no return i was born to belong to
dulcinea del toboso and the fates if there are any dedicated me to
her and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies
in my heart is to suppose an impossibility this frank declaration should
suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty for no one
hearing this altisidora with a show of anger and agitation exclaimed
gods life don stockfish soul of a mortar stone of a date more
obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his mind
made up if i fall upon you ill tear your eyes out do you fancy don
vanquished don cudgelled that i died for your sake all that you have
seen to night has been make believe im not the woman to let the black
of my nail suffer for such a camel much less die
that i can well believe said sancho for all that about lovers pining
to death is absurd they may talk of it but as for doing it judas may
while they were talking the musician singer and poet who had sung the
two stanzas given above came in and making a profound obeisance to don
quixote said will your worship sir knight reckon and retain me in the
number of your most faithful servants for i have long been a great
admirer of yours as well because of your fame as because of your
achievements will your worship tell me who you are replied don
quixote so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts the
young man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night
before of a truth said don quixote your worship has a most
excellent voice but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the
purpose for what have garcilassos stanzas to do with the death of this
dont be surprised at that returned the musician for with the callow
poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleases and
pilfer where he chooses whether it be germane to the matter or not and
now a days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or write that is
don quixote was about to reply but was prevented by the duke and
duchess who came in to see him and with them there followed a long and
delightful conversation in the course of which sancho said so many droll
and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at
his simplicity but at his sharpness don quixote begged their permission
to take his departure that same day inasmuch as for a vanquished knight
like himself it was fitter he should live in a pig sty than in a royal
palace they gave it very readily and the duchess asked him if
he replied senora let me tell your ladyship that this damsels ailment
comes entirely of idleness and the cure for it is honest and constant
employment she herself has told me that lace is worn in hell and as she
must know how to make it let it never be out of her hands for when she
is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro the image or images of
what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts this is the
truth this is my opinion and this is my advice
and mine added sancho for i never in all my life saw a lace maker
that died for love when damsels are at work their minds are more set on
finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves i speak from my
own experience for when im digging i never think of my old woman i
mean my teresa panza whom i love better than my own eyelids you say
well sancho said the duchess and i will take care that my altisidora
employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort for she is
extremely expert at it there is no occasion to have recourse to that
remedy senora said altisidora for the mere thought of the cruelty
with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot him
out of my memory without any other device with your highnesss leave i
will retire not to have before my eyes i wont say his rueful
countenance but his abominable ugly looks that reminds me of the
common saying that he that rails is ready to forgive said the duke
altisidora then pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief
made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room
ill luck betide thee poor damsel said sancho ill luck betide thee
thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as hard as
oak had it been me ifaith another cock would have crowed to thee
so the conversation came to an end and don quixote dressed himself and
dined with the duke and duchess and set out the same evening
of what passed between don quixote and his squire sancho on the way to
the vanquished and afflicted don quixote went along very downcast in one
respect and very happy in another his sadness arose from his defeat and
his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in sancho as
had been proved by the resurrection of altisidora though it was with
difficulty he could persuade himself that the love smitten damsel had
been really dead sancho went along anything but cheerful for it grieved
him that altisidora had not kept her promise of giving him the smocks
and turning this over in his mind he said to his master surely senor
im the most unlucky doctor in the world theres many a physician that
after killing the sick man he had to cure requires to be paid for his
work though it is only signing a bit of a list of medicines that the
apothecary and not he makes up and there his labour is over but with
me though to cure somebody else costs me drops of blood smacks pinches
pinproddings and whippings nobody gives me a farthing well i swear by
all thats good if they put another patient into my hands theyll have
to grease them for me before i cure him for as they say its by his
singing the abbot gets his dinner and im not going to believe that
heaven has bestowed upon me the virtue i have that i should be dealing
thou art right sancho my friend said don quixote and altisidora has
behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised and
although that virtue of thine is gratis data as it has cost thee no
study whatever any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may
be i can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the lashes
on account of the disenchant of dulcinea i would have given it to thee
freely ere this i am not sure however whether payment will comport
with the cure and i would not have the reward interfere with the
medicine i think there will be nothing lost by trying it consider how
much thou wouldst have sancho and whip thyself at once and pay thyself
down with thine own hand as thou hast money of mine
at this proposal sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palms breadth
wide and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself and
said he to his master very well then senor ill hold myself in
readiness to gratify your worships wishes if im to profit by it for
the love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping let your
worship say how much you will pay me for each lash i give myself
if sancho replied don quixote i were to requite thee as the
importance and nature of the cure deserves the treasures of venice the
mines of potosi would be insufficient to pay thee see what thou hast of
mine and put a price on each lash
of them said sancho there are three thousand three hundred and odd
of these i have given myself five the rest remain let the five go for
the odd ones and let us take the three thousand three hundred which at
a quarter real apiece for i will not take less though the whole world
should bid me make three thousand three hundred quarter reals the three
thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals which make seven
hundred and fifty reals and the three hundred make a hundred and fifty
half reals which come to seventy five reals which added to the seven
hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty five reals in all these
i will stop out of what i have belonging to your worship and ill return
home rich and content though well whipped for theres no taking
o blessed sancho o dear sancho said don quixote how we shall be
bound to serve thee dulcinea and i all the days of our lives that
heaven may grant us if she returns to her lost shape and it cannot be
but that she will her misfortune will have been good fortune and my
defeat a most happy triumph but look here sancho when wilt thou begin
the scourging for if thou wilt make short work of it i will give thee a
when said sancho this night without fail let your worship order it
so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air and ill scarify
night longed for by don quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world
came at last though it seemed to him that the wheels of apollos car had
broken down and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual
just as is the case with lovers who never make the reckoning of their
desires agree with time they made their way at length in among some
pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road and there
vacating rocinantes saddle and dapples pack saddle they stretched
themselves on the green grass and made their supper off sanchos stores
and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of dapples halter and
headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech
trees don quixote seeing him march off with such resolution and spirit
said to him take care my friend not to cut thyself to pieces allow
the lashes to wait for one another and do not be in so great a hurry as
to run thyself out of breath midway i mean do not lay on so strenuously
as to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reached the desired
number and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much or too little i
will station myself apart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou
givest thyself may heaven help thee as thy good intention deserves
pledges dont distress a good payer said sancho i mean to lay on
in such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself for in that no
he then stripped himself from the waist upwards and snatching up the
rope he began to lay on and don quixote to count the lashes he might
have given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no
trifle and its price very low and holding his hand for a moment he
told his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain for
each of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real
go on sancho my friend and be not disheartened said don quixote
for i double the stakes as to price
in that case said sancho in gods hand be it and let it rain
lashes but the rogue no longer laid them on his shoulders but laid on
to the trees with such groans every now and then that one would have
thought at each of them his soul was being plucked up by the roots don
quixote touched to the heart and fearing he might make an end of
himself and that through sanchos imprudence he might miss his own
object said to him as thou livest my friend let the matter rest
where it is for the remedy seems to me a very rough one and it will be
well to have patience zamora was not won in an hour if i have not
reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lashes that is
enough for the present for the ass to put it in homely phrase bears
no no senor replied sancho it shall never be said of me the
money paid the arms broken go back a little further your worship and
let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more for in a couple of
bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot and there will be
as thou art in such a willing mood said don quixote may heaven aid
sancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had the
bark stripped off several trees such was the severity with which he
whipped himself and one time raising his voice and giving a beech a
tremendous lash he cried out here dies samson and all with him
at the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash don
quixote ran to him at once and seizing the twisted halter that served
him for a courbash said to him heaven forbid sancho my friend that
to please me thou shouldst lose thy life which is needed for the support
of thy wife and children let dulcinea wait for a better opportunity and
i will content myself with a hope soon to be realised and have patience
until thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business
as your worship will have it so senor said sancho so be it but
throw your cloak over my shoulders for im sweating and i dont want to
take cold its a risk that novice disciplinants run
don quixote obeyed and stripping himself covered sancho who slept until
the sun woke him they then resumed their journey which for the time
being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues farther
on they dismounted at a hostelry which don quixote recognised as such
and did not take to be a castle with moat turrets portcullis and
drawbridge for ever since he had been vanquished he talked more
rationally about everything as will be shown presently they quartered
him in a room on the ground floor where in place of leather hangings
there were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in villages
on one of them was painted by some very poor hand the rape of helen when
the bold guest carried her off from menelaus and on the other was the
story of dido and aeneas she on a high tower as though she were making
signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was out at sea flying
in a frigate or brigantine he noticed in the two stories that helen did
not go very reluctantly for she was laughing slyly and roguishly but
the fair dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes
don quixote as he looked at them observed those two ladies were very
unfortunate not to have been born in this age and i unfortunate above
all men not to have been born in theirs had i fallen in with those
gentlemen troy would not have been burned or carthage destroyed for it
would have been only for me to slay paris and all these misfortunes
ill lay a bet said sancho that before long there wont be a tavern
roadside inn hostelry or barbers shop where the story of our doings
wont be painted up but id like it painted by the hand of a better
thou art right sancho said don quixote for this painter is like
orbaneja a painter there was at ubeda who when they asked him what he
was painting used to say whatever it may turn out and if he chanced
to paint a cock he would write under it this is a cock for fear they
might think it was a fox the painter or writer for its all the same
who published the history of this new don quixote that has come out must
have been one of this sort i think sancho for he painted or wrote
whatever it might turn out or perhaps he is like a poet called mauleon
that was about the court some years ago who used to answer at haphazard
whatever he was asked and on one asking him what deum de deo meant he
