the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the
head of their charges and their pastoral letters the poor people of the
country side had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among
the names and prenomens of their bishop that which had a meaning for
them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu
welcome we will follow their example and will also call him thus
when we have occasion to name him moreover this appellation pleased
i like that name said he bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur
we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable we
confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original
chapter iii a hard bishopric for a good bishop
the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his
carriage into alms the diocese of d is a fatiguing one there are
very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have
just seen thirty two curacies forty one vicarships and two hundred
and eighty five auxiliary chapels to visit all these is quite a task
the bishop managed to do it he went on foot when it was in the
neighborhood in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain and on
a donkey in the mountains the two old women accompanied him when the
trip was too hard for them he went alone
one day he arrived at senez which is an ancient episcopal city he was
mounted on an ass his purse which was very dry at that moment did not
permit him any other equipage the mayor of the town came to receive
him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass
with scandalized eyes some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i
perceive that i shock you you think it very arrogant in a poor priest
to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ i have done so from
necessity i assure you and not from vanity
in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked
rather than preached he never went far in search of his arguments and
his examples he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example
of a neighboring district in the cantons where they were harsh to the
poor he said look at the people of briancon they have conferred on
the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadows mown
three days in advance of every one else they rebuild their houses for
them gratuitously when they are ruined therefore it is a country which
is blessed by god for a whole century there has not been a single
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at
the people of embrun if at the harvest season the father of a family
has his son away on service in the army and his daughters at service in
the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to
the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the
inhabitants of the village men women and children go to the poor
mans field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his
grain to his granary to families divided by questions of money and
inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devolny a country so
wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years
well when the father of a family dies the boys go off to seek their
fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find
husbands to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the
farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said look at those good
peasants in the valley of queyras there are three thousand souls of
them mon dieu it is like a little republic neither judge nor bailiff
is known there the mayor does everything he allots the imposts
taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides
inheritances without charge pronounces sentences gratuitously and he
is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men to villages where
he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras do
you know how they manage he said since a little country of a
dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher they have
school masters who are paid by the whole valley who make the round
of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and
instruct them these teachers go to the fairs i have seen them there
they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord
of their hat those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach
reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning
and latin have three pens but what a disgrace to be ignorant do like
thus he discoursed gravely and paternally in default of examples he
invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and
many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus
christ and being convinced himself he was persuasive
his conversation was gay and affable he put himself on a level with the
two old women who had passed their lives beside him when he laughed
it was the laugh of a schoolboy madame magloire liked to call him your
grace votre grandeur one day he rose from his arm chair and went
to his library in search of a book this book was on one of the upper
shelves as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not
reach it madame magloire said he fetch me a chair my greatness
grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed
an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she
designated as the expectations of her three sons she had numerous
relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons
were the natural heirs the youngest of the three was to receive from a
grand aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the
heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to
succeed to the peerage of his grandfather the bishop was accustomed to
listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts on
one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual
while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these
inheritances and all these expectations she interrupted herself
impatiently mon dieu cousin what are you thinking about i am
thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be
found i believe in st augustine place your hopes in the man from
at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a
gentleman of the country side wherein not only the dignities of the
dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his
relatives spread over an entire page what a stout back death has
he exclaimed what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed
on him and how much wit must men have in order thus to press the tomb
he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always
concealed a serious meaning in the course of one lent a youthful vicar
came to d  and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent
the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the
poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful
manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he
represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was
a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m
geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse
cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m
geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that
sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old
beggar women at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to
share it one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing
this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by
a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which
induced reflection once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room
of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy
and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time
an ultra royalist and an ultra voltairian this variety of man has
actually existed when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you
must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and
answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur give them
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral
my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred
and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three
openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but
two openings the door and one window and three hundred and forty six
thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door and this
arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows just
put poor families old women and little children in those buildings
and behold the fevers and maladies which result alas god gives air to
men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god
in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments
of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even
wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have
no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in
pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly
country of dauphine they make bread for six months at one time they
bake it with dried cow dung in the winter they break this bread up with
an axe and they soak it for twenty four hours in order to render it
eatable my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of
born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the
south he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte
anaras passa as in the basses alpes puerte un bouen moutu embe un
bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine this pleased the people
extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all
spirits he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the
mountains he understood how to say the grandest things in the most
vulgar of idioms as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards
the lower classes he condemned nothing in haste and without taking
circumstances into account he said examine the road over which the
being as he described himself with a smile an ex sinner he had none
of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal
of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a
doctrine which may be summed up as follows
man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his
temptation he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it
check it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity there may
be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is
venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in
to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err
fall sin if you will but be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man no sin at all is the dream
of the angel all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very
quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is
a great crime which all the world commits these are hypocrisies
which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of
human society rest he said the faults of women of children of the
feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands
the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as
possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction
gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul
is full of shadow sin is therein committed the guilty one is not the
person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging
things i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the
point of trial discussed in a drawing room a wretched man being at
the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for
a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was
still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested
in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man she was
held but there were no proofs except against her she alone could
accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession she denied they
insisted she persisted in her denial thereupon an idea occurred to
the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of
the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly
presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and
that the man was deceiving her thereupon exasperated by jealousy she
the man was ruined he was shortly to be tried at aix with his
accomplice they were relating the matter and each one was expressing
enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy
into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had
educed the justice of revenge the bishop listened to all this in
where are this man and woman to be tried
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for
murder he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly
ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the
public the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the
day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the
prison fell ill a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his
last moments they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come
saying that is no affair of mine i have nothing to do with that
unpleasant task and with that mountebank i too am ill and besides
it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said
monsieur le cure is right it is not his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the
mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to
him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep
praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the
condemned man for his own he told him the best truths which are also
the most simple he was father brother friend he was bishop only to
bless he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man
was on the point of dying in despair death was an abyss to him as he
stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he
was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his
condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken
through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery
of things and which we call life he gazed incessantly beyond this
world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness the bishop
on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the
bishop was still there he followed him and exhibited himself to the
eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon
his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the
sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was
radiant he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god the
bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall
he said to him god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom
his brothers have rejected finds his father once more pray believe
enter into life the father is there when he descended from the
scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw
aside to let him pass they did not know which was most worthy of
admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble
dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least
understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on
this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing rooms
the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine
and it was a long time before he recovered from it
in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has
something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain
indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon
it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with
ones own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent
one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire
it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine
is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral
and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers
with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their
interrogation point around this chopping knife the scaffold is a
vision the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not
a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of
it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre
initiative one would say that this piece of carpenters work saw that
this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood
this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful
meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears
in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on the
scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats
flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated
by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a
horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day
following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop
appeared to be crushed the almost violent serenity of the funereal
moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him he
who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction
seemed to be reproaching himself at times he talked to himself and
stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice this is one which his
sister overheard one evening and preserved i did not think that it was
so monstrous it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a
degree as not to perceive human law death belongs to god alone by what
in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided
m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and
dying he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and
his greatest labor widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon
him he came of his own accord he understood how to sit down and hold
his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his
love of the mother who had lost her child as he knew the moment for
silence he knew also the moment for speech oh admirable consoler he
sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify
have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think
not of that which perishes gaze steadily you will perceive the living
light of your well beloved dead in the depths of heaven he knew that
faith is wholesome he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by
pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which
gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a
chapter v monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long
the private life of m myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his
public life the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d lived
would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have
like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little
this brief slumber was profound in the morning he meditated for an
hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own
house his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk
of his own cows then he set to work
a bishop is a very busy man he must every day receive the secretary
of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his
vicars general he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant
a whole ecclesiastical library to examine prayer books diocesan
catechisms books of hours etc charges to write sermons to
authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an
administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the
holy see and a thousand matters of business
what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and
his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous
the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the
afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work sometimes
he dug in his garden again he read or wrote he had but one word
for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening the mind is a
towards mid day when the weather was fine he went forth and took a
stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings he
was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down
supporting himself on his long cane clad in his wadded purple garment
of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse
shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels
of large bullion to droop from its three points
it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared one would have said that
his presence had something warming and luminous about it the children
and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the
sun he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him they pointed out
his house to any one who was in need of anything
here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled
upon the mothers he visited the poor so long as he had any money when
he no longer had any he visited the rich
as he made his cassocks last a long while and did not wish to have it
noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak
on his return he dined the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame
magloire standing behind them and serving them at table nothing could
be more frugal than this repast if however the bishop had one of his
cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to
serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some
fine game from the mountains every cure furnished the pretext for
a good meal the bishop did not interfere with that exception his
ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil
soup thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in
the cheer of a cure he indulges in the cheer of a trappist
after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine
and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing
sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio he was
a man of letters and rather learned he left behind him five or six
very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in
genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated upon the waters
with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says
the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was
precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of
onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew upon the face of
the waters in another dissertation he examines the theological works
of hugo bishop of ptolemais great grand uncle to the writer of this
book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed
the divers little works published during the last century under the
sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might
be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound
meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of
the volume itself these lines have often no connection whatever with
the book which contains them we now have under our eyes a note written
by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain
with generals clinton cornwallis and the admirals on the american
station versailles poincot book seller and paris pissot
ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful the maccabees call you the
creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls
you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you
light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence
leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you god man
calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most
toward nine oclock in the evening the two women retired and betook
themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until
it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the
chapter vi who guarded his house for him
the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground
floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three
chambers on the first and an attic above behind the house was a
garden a quarter of an acre in extent the two women occupied the
first floor the bishop was lodged below the first room opening on the
street served him as dining room the second was his bedroom and the
third his oratory there was no exit possible from this oratory except
by passing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom without passing
through the dining room at the end of the suite in the oratory there
was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the
the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added
to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into
a kitchen and cellar in addition to this there was in the garden a
stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in
which the bishop kept two cows no matter what the quantity of milk they
gave he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in
the hospital i am paying my tithes he said
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad
weather as wood is extremely dear at d  he hit upon the idea of
having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow shed here he
passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his
in this winter salon as in the dining room there was no other
furniture than a square table in white wood and four straw seated
chairs in addition to this the dining room was ornamented with an
antique sideboard painted pink in water colors out of a similar
sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the
bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory
his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d had more than once
assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for monseigneurs
oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to
the poor the most beautiful of altars he said is the soul of an
in his oratory there were two straw prie dieu and there was an
arm chair also in straw in his bedroom when by chance he received
seven or eight persons at one time the prefect or the general or the
staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little
seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the
stable the prie dieu from the oratory and the arm chair from the
bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the
visitors a room was dismantled for each new guest
it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop
then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front
of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was
there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was
half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service
only when propped against the wall mademoiselle baptistine had also in
her own room a very large easy chair of wood which had formerly been
gilded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been
obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window
as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned
among the possibilities in the way of furniture
mademoiselle baptistines ambition had been to be able to purchase a set
of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose
pattern and with mahogany in swans neck style with a sofa but this
would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact
that she had only been able to lay by forty two francs and ten sous for
this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing
the idea however who is there who has attained his ideal
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishops
bedchamber a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the
bed a hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serge in the
shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet
which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there
were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the
other near the bookcase opening into the dining room the bookcase was
a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of
wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire in the
chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron ornamented above with two
garlanded vases and flutings which had formerly been silvered
with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the
chimney piece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed
on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the
gilding had fallen near the glass door a large table with an inkstand
loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the
table an arm chair of straw in front of the bed a prie dieu borrowed
two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of
the bed small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at
the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented
one the abbe of chaliot bishop of saint claude the other the abbe
tourteau vicar general of agde abbe of grand champ order of citeaux
diocese of chartres when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after
the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left
them they were priests and probably donors two reasons for respecting
them all that he knew about these two persons was that they had
been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his
benefice on the same day the 27th of april 1785 madame magloire
having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these
particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed
by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of
at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which
finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one
madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle
of it this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often called
attention to it how delightful that is he said
all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground
floor as well as those on the first floor were white washed which is a
however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the
paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment
of mademoiselle baptistine as we shall see further on before becoming
a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the
bourgeois hence this decoration the chambers were paved in red bricks
which were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was
exquisitely clean from top to bottom this was the sole luxury which the
bishop permitted he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former
possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup ladle which
madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened
splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth and since we are now painting
the bishop of d as he was in reality we must add that he had said
more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive
silver which he had inherited from a great aunt these candlesticks
held two wax candles and usually figured on the bishops chimney piece
when he had any one to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles
in the bishops own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small
cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and
forks and the big spoon every night but it is necessary to add that
the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which
we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross form radiating
from a tank another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted
the white wall which enclosed it these alleys left behind them four
square plots rimmed with box in three of these madame magloire
cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some
flowers here and there stood a few fruit trees madame magloire had
once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn
everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot it would be
better to grow salads there than bouquets madame magloire retorted
the bishop you are mistaken the beautiful is as useful as the
useful he added after a pause more so perhaps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop
almost as much as did his books he liked to pass an hour or two there
trimming hoeing and making holes here and there in the earth into
which he dropped seeds he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener
could have wished to see him moreover he made no pretensions to
botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest
effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part
neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against
linnaeus he did not study plants he loved flowers he respected
learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without
ever failing in these two respects he watered his flower beds every
summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green
the house had not a single door which could be locked the door of the
dining room which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral
square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door
of a prison the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door
was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the
latch all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it
a push at first the two women had been very much tried by this door
which was never fastened but monsieur de d had said to them have
bolts put on your rooms if that will please you they had ended by
sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it
madame magloire alone had frights from time to time as for the bishop
his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three
lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of
difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had
written this other note am not i a physician like them i also have my
patients and then too i have some whom i call my unfortunates
again he wrote do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of
you the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs
it chanced that a worthy cure i know not whether it was the cure of
couloubroux or the cure of pompierry took it into his head to ask
him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether
monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to a
certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the
mercy of any one who should choose to enter and whether in short
he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little
guarded the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and
said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigilant qui
custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch
he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as
the bravery of a colonel of dragoons only he added ours must be
it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not
omit because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a
after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes who had infested the
gorges of ollioules one of his lieutenants cravatte took refuge in
the mountains he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the
remnant of gaspard bess troop in the county of nice then he made his
way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity
of barcelonette he was first seen at jauziers then at tuiles he hid
himself in the caverns of the joug de laigle and thence he descended
towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and
he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night
and despoiled the sacristy his highway robberies laid waste the
country side the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain he
always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force he was a bold
wretch in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived he was
making his circuit to chastelar the mayor came to meet him and urged
him to retrace his steps cravatte was in possession of the mountains
as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it
merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose
therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort
you do not really mean that monseigneur exclaimed the mayor
i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and
there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny
community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years
they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds they own
one goat out of every thirty that they tend they make very pretty
woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain airs on
little flutes with six holes they need to be told of the good god now
and then what would they say to a bishop who was afraid what would
hold said the bishop i must think of that you are right i may
meet them they too need to be told of the good god
but monseigneur there is a band of them a flock of wolves
monsieur le maire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves
that jesus has constituted me the shepherd who knows the ways of
an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers bah
oh mon dieu what if you should meet them
i should beg alms of them for my poor
do not go monseigneur in the name of heaven you are risking your
monsieur le maire said the bishop is that really all i am not in
the world to guard my own life but to guard souls
they had to allow him to do as he pleased he set out accompanied only
by a child who offered to serve as a guide his obstinacy was bruited
about the country side and caused great consternation
he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire he traversed the
mountain on mule back encountered no one and arrived safe and sound
at the residence of his good friends the shepherds he remained
there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching
exhorting when the time of his departure approached he resolved to
chant a te deum pontifically he mentioned it to the cure but what was
to be done there were no episcopal ornaments they could only place at
his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasubles
bah said the bishop let us announce our te deum from the pulpit
nevertheless monsieur le cure things will arrange themselves
they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood all the
magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed
to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly
while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and
deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who
departed on the instant the chest was opened it contained a cope of
cloth of gold a mitre ornamented with diamonds an archbishops cross
a magnificent crosier all the pontifical vestments which had been
stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame dembrun in
the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravatte
did not i say that things would come right of themselves said the
bishop then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with
the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop
monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile
the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority
when he returned to chastelar the people came out to stare at him as at
a curiosity all along the road at the priests house in chastelar he
rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire who were waiting
for him and he said to his sister well was i in the right the poor
priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns
from them with his hands full i set out bearing only my faith in god i
have brought back the treasure of a cathedral
that evening before he went to bed he said again let us never fear
robbers nor murderers those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves prejudices are the real robbers vices are the
real murderers the great dangers lie within ourselves what matters it
what threatens our head or our purse let us think only of that which
then turning to his sister sister never a precaution on the part
of the priest against his fellow man that which his fellow does god
permits let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger
is approaching us let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother
may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life we relate those of which
we know but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at
the same moment one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we
should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction it consisted of
very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very
well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate stolen
they had already been elsewhere half of the adventure was completed it
only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it
to take a short trip in the direction of the poor however we make no
assertions on this point only a rather obscure note was found among
the bishops papers which may bear some relation to this matter and
which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether
this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital
the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way
heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called
conscience sworn faith justice duty he had marched straight to his
goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his
interest he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by
any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons
his sons in law his relations and even to his friends having wisely
seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls
everything else seemed to him very stupid he was intelligent and just
sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he
was in reality only a product of pigault lebrun he laughed willingly
and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets
of that good old fellow the bishop he even sometimes laughed at him
with an amiable authority in the presence of m myriel himself who
on some semi official occasion or other i do not recollect what
count this senator and m myriel were to dine with the prefect
at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still
egad bishop lets have a discussion it is hard for a senator and a
bishop to look at each other without winking we are two augurs i am
going to make a confession to you i have a philosophy of my own
and you are right replied the bishop as one makes ones philosophy
so one lies on it you are on the bed of purple senator
i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis dargens
pyrrhon hobbes and m naigeon are no rascals i have all the
philosophers in my library gilded on the edges
i hate diderot he is an ideologist a declaimer and a revolutionist
a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire voltaire
made sport of needham and he was wrong for needhams eels prove that
god is useless a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies
the fiat lux suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger
you have the world man is the eel then what is the good of the eternal
father the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop it is good for nothing
but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow down with that
great all which torments me hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace
between you and me and in order to empty my sack and make confession
to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i
have good sense i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches
renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity tis the counsel of an
avaricious man to beggars renunciation why sacrifice to what end
i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another
wolf let us stick to nature then we are at the top let us have a
superior philosophy what is the advantage of being at the top if
one sees no further than the end of other peoples noses let us live
merrily life is all that man has another future elsewhere on high
below anywhere i dont believe not one single word of it ah
sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to
everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the
just and the unjust over the fas and the nefas why because i shall
have to render an account of my actions when after death what a fine
dream after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me
have a handful of dust seized by a shadow hand if you can let us tell
the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis
there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation
let us seek the real let us get to the bottom of it let us go into it
thoroughly what the deuce let us go to the bottom of it we must scent
out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it then it gives you
exquisite joys then you grow strong and you laugh i am square on the
bottom i am immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead mens
shoes ah what a charming promise trust to it if you like what a
fine lot adam has we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings
on our shoulder blades do come to my assistance is it not tertullian
who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star very well we
shall be the grasshoppers of the stars and then besides we shall
see god ta ta ta what twaddle all these paradises are god is a
nonsensical monster i would not say that in the moniteur egad but i
may whisper it among friends inter pocula to sacrifice the world to
paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow be the dupe of the
infinite im not such a fool i am a nought i call myself monsieur le
comte nought senator did i exist before my birth no shall i exist
after death no what am i a little dust collected in an organism what
am i to do on this earth the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy
whither will suffering lead me to nothingness but i shall have
suffered whither will enjoyment lead me to nothingness but i shall
have enjoyed myself my choice is made one must eat or be eaten i
shall eat it is better to be the tooth than the grass such is my
wisdom after which go whither i push thee the grave digger is there
the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great hole end finis
total liquidation this is the vanishing point death is death believe
me i laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell
me on that subject fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for
men no our to morrow is the night beyond the tomb there is nothing
but equal nothingness you have been sardanapalus you have been vincent
de paul it makes no difference that is the truth then live your life
above all things make use of your i while you have it in truth
bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i have my
philosophers i dont let myself be taken in with that nonsense
of course there must be something for those who are down for the
barefooted beggars knife grinders and miserable wretches legends
chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for
them to swallow they gobble it down they spread it on their dry bread
he who has nothing else has the good god that is the least he can
have i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naigeon for
myself the good god is good for the populace
thats talking he exclaimed what an excellent and really marvellous
thing is this materialism not every one who wants it can have it ah
when one does have it one is no longer a dupe one does not stupidly
allow ones self to be exiled like cato nor stoned like stephen nor
burned alive like jeanne darc those who have succeeded in procuring
this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves
irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without
