jai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le general  but
nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate the
scattered fragments of the army he left behind
 i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the general
then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially of
ney a greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way by
night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to
orsha abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his men
and lastly the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic
army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
characteristic of genius even that final running away described in
ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is
taught to be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the
when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical
ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all that
humanity calls right or even just the historians produce a saving
conception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standards
of right and wrong for the great man nothing is wrong there is no
atrocity for which a great man can be blamed
cest grand  say the historians and there no longer exists either
good or evil but only grand and not grand grand is good not grand
is bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of some
special animals called heroes and napoleon escaping home in a warm
fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades
but were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que cest
du sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny a
quun pas  said he and the whole world for fifty years has been
repeating sublime grand napoleon le grand du sublime au ridicule
 from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step
and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingness
for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human
actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicity
what russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of
1812 has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret
dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is
that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry
and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate
the aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off and
how was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than the
french had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when it
had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture
them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had
surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could
history or what is called by that name replying to these questions
says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov and
this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers
but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were
guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and
punished but even if we admitted that kutuzov chichagov and others
were the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible
why the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and
at the berezina in both cases we had superior forces the french army
with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what
the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military
historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is unfounded
for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the
enemy in full strength at borodino defeated at krasnoe and the berezina
by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically
if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but
all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last
period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a
series of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian
the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of
logic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical
rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admit
that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for
but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french
victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of
russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals
from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this
last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed namely that of
cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army
there never was or could have been such an aim for it would have been
it would have been senseless first because napoleons disorganized army
was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was
doing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performing
various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they
secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops in
order to destroy the french army which without external interference
was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not
blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually
did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army
fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
emperor kings and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest
degree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of
the time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senseless
would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when our
own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole
division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and
when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his
army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of
his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should
run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said
in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even
that could be said for those who drew up this project for it was not
they who had suffered from the trampled beds
but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have
it was impossible first because as experience shows that a three mile
movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the
probability of chichagov kutuzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction
on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
impossibility as in fact thought kutuzov who when he received the plan
remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which
napoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the
thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has no
meaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut off
an army to bar its road is quite impossible for there is always
plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can
be seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture
prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to
catch a swallow if it settles on ones hand men can only be taken
prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not
consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited
fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world
began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
in 1812 and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its
strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost
fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to the
population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the army
and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and
sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and was
camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of
frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the
rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
maintained when men were taken into that region of death where
discipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but for
months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
cold when half the army perished in a single month it is of this
period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich
should have made a flank march to such and such a place tormasov to
another place and chichagov should have crossed more than knee deep in
snow to somewhere else and how so and so routed and cut off the
the russians half of whom died did all that could and should have been
done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame
because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they should
all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
and sentiments of various generals and not the history of the events
to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do their
surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of
yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble
easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution
the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the
imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was
the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim
was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and
so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was
attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and
thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french
ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped
the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the
experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
menace than to strike the running animal on the head
when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance
similar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a
beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at
the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound which
like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but always
aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch
after prince andrews death natasha and princess mary alike felt this
drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they
carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact
everything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons to
dinner the maids inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still any
word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully
irritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they
both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into those
mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they
spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very
both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a
future seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did
they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them that
what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in
words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the
majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before
continued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything
that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the
boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with
still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling
but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy
princess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first to
be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to
which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put
was damp and he began to cough alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports
on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street which
had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did not
stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess
mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had
lived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
natasha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with
alpatych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and
natasha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making
preparations for departure held aloof from her too
princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscow
and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter
losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the
advice of moscow doctors would be good for her
i am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to
her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room with
difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than
after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief
natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddled
up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting
something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhausted
and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone
entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression and
picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the
she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on
which with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her
one day toward the end of december natasha pale and thin dressed in a
black woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was
crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and
smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side
of life and that other side of life of which she had never before
thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable
was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of
life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering
she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him
otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been
she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own and
sometimes devised other words they might have spoken
there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his
head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his
shoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and a
wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitches
just perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is struggling with
terrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain what
does he feel how does it hurt him thought natasha he noticed her
watching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriously
one thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to a
suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly
at her natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she
would say she said this cant go on it wont you will get well
she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she
had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
i agreed natasha now said to herself that it would be dreadful if
he always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have
been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it
would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared death
and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i
thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have
said even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyes
i should have been happy compared with what i am now now there is
nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know
it and now it will never never be possible to put it right and now
he again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in her
imagination natasha this time gave him a different answer she stopped
him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me
there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest
happiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed
it that terrible evening four days before his death and in her
imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
said then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love love
she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again
everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a
strained frown she peered toward the world where he was and now now it
seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at the instant
when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a
loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears dunyasha
her maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look
on her face and showing no concern for her mistress
come to your papa at once please said she with a strange excited
look a misfortune about peter ilynich a letter she finished
besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a
special estrangement from the members of her own family all of them
her father mother and sonya were so near to her so familiar so
commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the
world in which she had been living of late and she felt not merely
indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she heard
dunyashas words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not grasp
what misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just live
their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natasha
as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her
mothers room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he had
evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
choking him when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly and
burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face
pe petya go go she is calling and weeping like a child
and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell into
suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natashas whole being
terrible anguish struck her heart she felt a dreadful ache as if
something was being torn inside her and she were dying but the pain was
immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive
constraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of her
father the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the
door made her immediately forget herself and her own grief
she ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to her
mothers door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came out
from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to her
natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausing
at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ran
the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position
stretching out and beating her head against the wall sonya and the
natasha natasha cried the countess its not true its not
true hes lying natasha she shrieked pushing those around her
away go away all of you its not true killed ha ha ha
natasha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother embraced
her and with unexpected strength raised her turned her face toward
mummy darling i am here my dearest mummy she kept on
she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her
demanded a pillow and hot water and unfastened and tore open her
my dearest darling mummy my precious she whispered
incessantly kissing her head her hands her face and feeling her own
irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks
the countess pressed her daughters hand closed her eyes and became
quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness
glanced vacantly around her and seeing natasha began to press her
daughters head with all her strength then she turned toward her
daughters face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it
natasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper natasha
you would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truth
natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was
nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness
my darling mummy she repeated straining all the power of her love to
find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her
and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing to
believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom
of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium
natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the
next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her
persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess
every moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to life
during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes
and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes
but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was
how glad i am you have come you are tired wont you have some tea
natasha went up to her you have improved in looks and grown more
manly continued the countess taking her daughters hand
and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the first
princess mary postponed her departure sonya and the count tried to
replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able to
restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natasha
remained constantly at her mothers side sleeping on a lounge chair in
her room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantly
because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her
the mothers wounded spirit could not heal petyas death had torn from
her half her life when the news of petyas death had come she had been
a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her room
a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow that
almost killed the countess this second blow restored natasha to life
a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a
physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may
heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet
heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within
natashas wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended but
her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of
life love was still active within her love awoke and so did life
prince andrews last days had bound princess mary and natasha together
this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary
put off her departure and for three weeks looked after natasha as if
she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her mothers bedroom
one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever princess mary took
her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay down
but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
i dont want to sleep mary sit by me a little
no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me
she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary
natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
is she like him thought natasha yes like and yet not like but she
is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what is
in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like what
does she think about me yes she is splendid
mary she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herself
mary you mustnt think me wicked no mary darling how i love you
and natasha embracing her began kissing her face and hands making
princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings
from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
between women was established between princess mary and natasha they
were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and
spent most of their time together when one went out the other became
restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony
with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a
feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusive
feeling of life being possible only in each others presence
sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already
in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they spoke most
of what was long past princess mary spoke of her childhood of her
mother her father and her daydreams and natasha who with a passive
lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
devotion submission and the poetry of christian self sacrifice now
feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to love her
past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
her she did not think of applying submission and self abnegation to her
own life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understood
and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues for
princess mary listening to natashas tales of childhood and early
youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
just as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they
thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him had
the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being
natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
talked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she was
suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness
and loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
carefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed her
drawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed to
her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad
one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath
unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down and
then testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the result
another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled so she called
again though she could hear dunyasha coming called her in the deep
chest tones in which she had been wont to sing and listened attentively
she did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layer
of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicate
young shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would so
cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it
would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to heal
at the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the count
insisted on natashas going with her to consult the doctors
after the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to hold
back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and
so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russians
who pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle the
flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not
keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the
information received of the movements of the french was never reliable
the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching
at the rate of twenty seven miles a day that they could not go any
to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only
necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not
losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and
less than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a
hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand
the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was that
the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction
as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in
enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own
people the chief cause of the wastage of napoleons army was the
rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the
kutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the
movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian
army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done at
tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another
reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov
the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the
french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on
their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at
some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all
the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of
the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable
aim was to shorten those marches to that end kutuzovs activity was
directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or
intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it
kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of
his russian being what every russian soldier felt that the french were
beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the
same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march
the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year
but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army
who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some
reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle
must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer
somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another
they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
ill shod insufficiently clad and half starved who within a month and
without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at
the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance
than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier
this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and
to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on
so it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three
french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen
thousand men despite all kutuzovs efforts to avoid that ruinous
encounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob of
french soldiers by worn out russians continued at krasnoe for three
toll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and so
etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition
prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds
that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not
arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselves
in the forest by night making their way round as best they could and
miloradovich who said he did not want to know anything about the
commissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when he
was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  as he styled
himself who was fond of parleys with the french sent envoys demanding
their surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do
i give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops and
and the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
scarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to them
that is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold frost bitten
and starving and the column that had been presented to them threw down
its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do
at krasnoe they took twenty six thousand prisoners several hundred
cannon and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed as to who
had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement
though they much regretted not having taken napoleon or at least a
marshal or a hero of some sort and reproached one another and
especially kutuzov for having failed to do so
these men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of the
most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes and
imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed
they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the
campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought of
nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen
factories because he was comfortable there that at krasnoe he checked
the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite
lost his head and that it was probable that he had an understanding
with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so on
not only did his contemporaries carried away by their passions talk in
this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand
while kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weak
old courtier and by russians as something indefinite a sort of puppet
useful only because he had a russian name
in 1812 and 1813 kutuzov was openly accused of blundering the emperor
was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of
the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court
liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders at
krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of
 history of the year 1812 the character of kutuzov and reflections on
the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovich
such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian mind
does not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individuals
who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to
it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
for russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleon that most
insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showed
human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is
grand but kutuzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his
activity in 1812 never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to
vilna presented an example exceptional in history of self sacrifice and
a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening
kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and when
speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed
and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be
difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will
of the whole people still more difficult would it be to find an
instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so
completely accomplished as that to which all kutuzovs efforts were
kutuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the
pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of what
he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said
nothing about himself adopted no pose always appeared to be the
simplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most
ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de
stael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested with
generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who tried
to prove anything to him when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge
galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the
destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon
moscow without a battle kutuzov replied and i shall not abandon
moscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned when
arakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to be
appointed chief of the artillery kutuzov replied yes i was just
saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the
contrary what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless
crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the
calamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to
him who was appointed chief of the artillery
not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by
experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite
meaningless words that happened to enter his head
but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole
time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite of
himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real
thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood
beginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreement
with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodino
was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and
reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of
moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to lauristons proposal of
peace he said there can be no peace for such is the peoples will he
alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are
useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither
the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that
we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would
not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen
and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to
please the emperor he alone incurring thereby the emperors
displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is
nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
events his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed
to one and the same threefold end 1 to brace all his strength for
conflict with the french 2 to defeat them and 3 to drive them out
of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time this
enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing the
preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who before
the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in
contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodino
was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat
insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought
and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia
it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only
we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that
existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and
but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion
so truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events that
in all his activity he was never once untrue to it
the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the
events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in
only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
the people in so strange a manner contrary to the tsars wish to
select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the
national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human
pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all his powers
not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast
in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that
to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of
the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of
krasnoe toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by
generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had
been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the
enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
battle kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters
the day was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump little
white horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who
whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of
french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them
were crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immense
crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the road
beside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of the
commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on
kutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat
that bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on his
white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and
kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially
wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frost bitten noses
and cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyes
one group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one of
whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw flesh
with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the
fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent
expression with which after a glance at kutuzov the soldier with the
sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing
kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered his
face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another
spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the
shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov with
the same expression on his face again swayed his head
what were you saying he asked the general who continuing his report
directed the commander in chiefs attention to some standards captured
from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment
ah the standards said kutuzov evidently detaching himself with
he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from
he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply and
closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the
standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them
kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evident
reluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head and
began to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked
attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of
i thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again the
officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
distinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful service
the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you
lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally
lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk
standards lower lower thats it hurrah lads he added addressing
the men with a rapid movement of his chin
while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle
and bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all at
once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longer
the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the
soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to
you see brothers i know its hard for you but it cant be helped
