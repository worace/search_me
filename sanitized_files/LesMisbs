from time to time as they passed the lighted shop windows the smallest
halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from
well he is a very green un said gavroche
then becoming thoughtful he muttered between his teeth
all the same if i had charge of the babes id lock em up better than
just as they were finishing their morsel of bread and had reached the
angle of that gloomy rue des ballets at the other end of which the low
and threatening wicket of la force was visible
hullo is that you gavroche said some one
a man had just accosted the street urchin and the man was no other
than montparnasse in disguise with blue spectacles but recognizable to
the bow wows went on gavroche youve got a hide the color of a
linseed plaster and blue specs like a doctor youre putting on style
and he drew gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops
the two little ones followed mechanically holding each other by the
when they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere sheltered
do you know where im going demanded montparnasse
to the abbey of ascend with regret36 replied gavroche
ah exclaimed gavroche so her name is babet
and he rapidly related to the gamin how on the morning of that very
day babet having been transferred to la conciergerie had made his
escape by turning to the left instead of to the right in the police
montparnasse added a few details as to babets flight and ended with
gavroche as he listened had seized a cane that montparnasse held in
his hand and mechanically pulled at the upper part and the blade of a
ah he exclaimed pushing the dagger back in haste you have brought
the deuce resumed gavroche so youre going to have a bout with the
you cant tell replied montparnasse with an indifferent air its
always a good thing to have a pin about one
again montparnasse took a grave tone and said mouthing every syllable
something happened tother day fancy i meet a bourgeois he makes
me a present of a sermon and his purse i put it in my pocket a minute
later i feel in my pocket theres nothing there
but you went on montparnasse where are you bound for now
gavroche pointed to his two proteges and said
im going to put these infants to bed
montparnasse though not naturally inclined to astonishment could not
well yes in the elephant retorted gavroche kekcaa
this is another word of the language which no one writes and which
kekcaa signifies quest que cest que cela a whats the matter with
the urchins profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and
good sense he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to
of course said he yes the elephant is it comfortable there
very said gavroche its really bully there there aint any
parbleu i should say so but you mustnt tell its between the fore
a turn of the hand cric crac and its all over no one there
i shall have a ladder for these children
where the devil did you pick up those young uns
they are some brats that a wig maker made me a present of
he took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than
two quills wrapped in cotton and thrust one up each of his nostrils
that changes you remarked gavroche you are less homely so you
ought to keep them on all the time
montparnasse was a handsome fellow but gavroche was a tease
seriously demanded montparnasse how do you like me so
the sound of his voice was different also in a twinkling montparnasse
oh do play porrichinelle for us exclaimed gavroche
the two children who had not been listening up to this point being
occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses drew
near at this name and stared at montparnasse with dawning joy and
he laid his hand on gavroches shoulder and said to him emphasizing
his words listen to what i tell you boy if i were on the square with
my dog my knife and my wife and if you were to squander ten sous on
me i wouldnt refuse to work but this isnt shrove tuesday
this odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin he wheeled
round hastily darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound
attention and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to
them a few paces off gavroche allowed an ah good to escape him
but immediately suppressed it and shaking montparnasses hand
well good evening said he im going off to my elephant with my
brats supposing that you should need me some night you can come and
hunt me up there i lodge on the entresol there is no porter you will
and they parted montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of
the greve and gavroche towards the bastille the little one of five
dragged along by his brother who was dragged by gavroche turned his
head back several times to watch porrichinelle as he went
the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche
of the presence of the policeman contained no other talisman than
the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms this
syllable dig uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of
a phrase means take care we can no longer talk freely there was
besides in montparnasses sentence a literary beauty which was
lost upon gavroche that is mon dogue ma dague et ma digue a slang
expression of the temple which signifies my dog my knife and my wife
greatly in vogue among clowns and the red tails in the great century
twenty years ago there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of
the place de la bastille near the basin of the canal excavated in the
ancient ditch of the fortress prison a singular monument which has
already been effaced from the memories of parisians and which deserved
to leave some trace for it was the idea of a member of the institute
the general in chief of the army of egypt
we say monument although it was only a rough model but this model
itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of
napoleons which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown
on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had
acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional
aspect it was an elephant forty feet high constructed of timber and
masonry bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house formerly
painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind
and time in this deserted and unprotected corner of the place the
broad brow of the colossus his trunk his tusks his tower his
enormous crupper his four feet like columns produced at night under
the starry heavens a surprising and terrible form it was a sort of
symbol of popular force it was sombre mysterious and immense it was
some mighty visible phantom one knew not what standing erect beside
few strangers visited this edifice no passer by looked at it it was
falling into ruins every season the plaster which detached itself
from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it the aediles as the
expression ran in elegant dialect had forgotten it ever since 1814
there it stood in its corner melancholy sick crumbling surrounded
by a rotten palisade soiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks
meandered athwart its belly a lath projected from its tail tall grass
flourished between its legs and as the level of the place had been
rising all around it for a space of thirty years by that slow and
continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns
it stood in a hollow and it looked as though the ground were giving way
beneath it it was unclean despised repulsive and superb ugly in the
eyes of the bourgeois melancholy in the eyes of the thinker there was
something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out
and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated
as we have said at night its aspect changed night is the real element
of everything that is dark as soon as twilight descended the old
elephant became transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable
appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows being of the past
he belonged to night and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur
this rough squat heavy hard austere almost misshapen but assuredly
majestic monument stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage
gravity has disappeared and left to reign in peace a sort of gigantic
stove ornamented with its pipe which has replaced the sombre fortress
with its nine towers very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal
classes it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an
epoch in which a pot contains power this epoch will pass away people
have already begun to understand that if there can be force in a
boiler there can be no force except in the brain in other words
that which leads and drags on the world is not locomotives but ideas
harness locomotives to ideas that is well done but do not mistake the
at all events to return to the place de la bastille the architect
of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster the
architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of
this stove pipe which has been baptized by a sonorous name and called
the column of july this monument of a revolution that miscarried
was still enveloped in 1832 in an immense shirt of woodwork which we
regret for our part and by a vast plank enclosure which completed the
it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection
of a distant street lamp that the gamin guided his two brats
the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him
that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the
tribunals were called upon to judge under the charge of vagabondage
and mutilation of a public monument a child who had been caught asleep
in this very elephant of the bastille this fact noted we proceed
on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus gavroche comprehended the
effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small
then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephants enclosure
and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach the two
children somewhat frightened followed gavroche without uttering a
word and confided themselves to this little providence in rags which
had given them bread and had promised them a shelter
there extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served
the laborers in the neighboring timber yard gavroche raised it with
remarkable vigor and placed it against one of the elephants forelegs
near the point where the ladder ended a sort of black hole in the belly
gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to
he clasped the rough leg of the elephant and in a twinkling without
deigning to make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture he
entered it as an adder slips through a crevice and disappeared within
and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale
appear vaguely on the edge of the shadowy hole like a wan and whitish
well he exclaimed climb up young uns youll see how snug it is
here come up you he said to the elder ill lend you a hand
the little fellows nudged each other the gamin frightened and inspired
them with confidence at one and the same time and then it was raining
very hard the elder one undertook the risk the younger on seeing his
brother climbing up and himself left alone between the paws of this
huge beast felt greatly inclined to cry but he did not dare
the elder lad climbed with uncertain steps up the rungs of the ladder
gavroche in the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamations like a
fencing master to his pupils or a muleteer to his mules
dont be afraid thats it come on put your feet there give us
and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and
vigorously by the arm and pulled him towards him
now said gavroche wait for me be so good as to take a seat
and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down
the elephants leg with the agility of a monkey landed on his feet in
the grass grasped the child of five round the body and planted him
fairly in the middle of the ladder then he began to climb up behind
im going to boost him do you tug
and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled
thrust stuffed into the hole before he had time to recover himself
and gavroche entering behind him and repulsing the ladder with a kick
which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry
now young uns you are in my house
oh unforeseen utility of the useless charity of great things goodness
of giants this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the
emperors had become the box of a street urchin the brat had been
accepted and sheltered by the colossus the bourgeois decked out in
their sunday finery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond
of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes
whats the good of that it served to save from the cold the frost
the hail and rain to shelter from the winds of winter to preserve
from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the
snow which produces death a little being who had no father no mother
no bread no clothes no refuge it served to receive the innocent whom
society repulsed it served to diminish public crime it was a lair
open to one against whom all doors were shut it seemed as though the
miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with
warts with mould and ulcers tottering worm eaten abandoned
condemned a sort of mendicant colossus asking alms in vain with a
benevolent look in the midst of the cross roads had taken pity on that
other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet
without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rags fed
on rejected scraps that was what the elephant of the bastille was good
for this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by
god that which had been merely illustrious had become august in order
to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass
iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster
sufficed for god the emperor had had the dream of a genius in that
titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing its
tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters he
wished to incarnate the people god had done a grander thing with it he
the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was
hardly visible from the outside being concealed as we have stated
beneath the elephants belly and so narrow that it was only cats and
lets begin said gavroche by telling the porter that we are not at
and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is
well acquainted with his apartments he took a plank and stopped up the
again gavroche plunged into the obscurity the children heard the
crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle the chemical
match was not yet in existence at that epoch the fumade steel
a sudden light made them blink gavroche had just managed to ignite one
of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats the
cellar rat which emitted more smoke than light rendered the interior
gavroches two guests glanced about them and the sensation which they
experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in
the great tun of heidelberg or better still like what jonah must have
felt in the biblical belly of the whale an entire and gigantic skeleton
appeared enveloping them above a long brown beam whence started at
regular distances massive arching ribs represented the vertebral
column with its sides stalactites of plaster depended from them like
entrails and vast spiders webs stretching from side to side formed
dirty diaphragms here and there in the corners were visible large
blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive and which
changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement
fragments which had fallen from the elephants back into his belly had
filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a
the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to
this remark drew an exclamation from gavroche the petrified air of the
whats that you are gabbling about there he exclaimed are
you scoffing at me are you turning up your noses do you want the
tuileries are you brutes come say i warn you that i dont belong to
the regiment of simpletons ah come now are you brats from the popes
a little roughness is good in cases of fear it is reassuring the two
gavroche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grave to
stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing
intonation its outside that it is black outside its raining here
it does not rain outside its cold here theres not an atom of wind
outside there are heaps of people here theres no one outside there
aint even the moon here theres my candle confound it
the two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror but
gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation
and he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the
gavroches bed was complete that is to say it had a mattress a
the mattress was a straw mat the blanket a rather large strip of
gray woollen stuff very warm and almost new this is what the alcove
three rather long poles thrust into and consolidated with the rubbish
which formed the floor that is to say the belly of the elephant two
in front and one behind and united by a rope at their summits so as to
form a pyramidal bundle this cluster supported a trellis work of brass
wire which was simply placed upon it but artistically applied and held
by fastenings of iron wire so that it enveloped all three holes a row
of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing
could pass under it this grating was nothing else than a piece of the
brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries gavroches
bed stood as in a cage behind this net the whole resembled an
this trellis work took the place of curtains
gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front
and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart
he made his guests enter the cage with great precaution then he crawled
in after them pulled the stones together and closed the opening
all three had stretched out on the mat gavroche still had the cellar
now said he go to sleep im going to suppress the candelabra
monsieur the elder of the brothers asked gavroche pointing to the
that answered gavroche gravely is for the rats go to sleep
nevertheless he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the
benefit of these young creatures and he continued
its a thing from the jardin des plantes its used for fierce animals
theres a whole shopful of them there all youve got to do is to climb
over a wall crawl through a window and pass through a door you can
as he spoke he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the
gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket
thats from the jardin des plantes too said he i took that from
and pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying a very
the beasts had all these things i took them away from them it didnt
trouble them i told them its for the elephant
you crawl over the walls and you dont care a straw for the government
the two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this
intrepid and ingenious being a vagabond like themselves isolated
like themselves frail like themselves who had something admirable
and all powerful about him who seemed supernatural to them and whose
physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank
mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles
monsieur ventured the elder timidly you are not afraid of the
the smaller had his eyes wide open but he said nothing as he was on
the edge of the mat the elder being in the middle gavroche tucked the
blanket round him as a mother might have done and heightened the mat
under his head with old rags in such a way as to form a pillow for the
ah yes replied the elder gazing at gavroche with the expression of
the two poor little children who had been soaked through began to grow
ah by the way continued gavroche what were you bawling about
and pointing out the little one to his brother
a mite like that ive nothing to say about but the idea of a big
fellow like you crying its idiotic you looked like a calf
gracious replied the child we have no lodging
bother retorted gavroche you dont say lodgings you say crib
and then we were afraid of being alone like that at night
listen went on gavroche you must never bawl again over anything
ill take care of you you shall see what fun well have in summer
well go to the glaciere with navet one of my pals well bathe in
the gare well run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at
austerlitz that makes the laundresses raging they scream they get
mad and if you only knew how ridiculous they are well go and see the
man skeleton and then ill take you to the play ill take you to see
frederick lemaitre i have tickets i know some of the actors i even
played in a piece once there were a lot of us fellers and we ran
under a cloth and that made the sea ill get you an engagement at my
theatre well go to see the savages they aint real those savages
aint they wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles and you can see
where their elbows have been darned with white then well go to the
opera well get in with the hired applauders the opera claque is well
managed i wouldnt associate with the claque on the boulevard at the
opera just fancy some of them pay twenty sous but theyre ninnies
theyre called dishclouts and then well go to see the guillotine work
ill show you the executioner he lives in the rue des marais monsieur
sanson he has a letter box at his door ah well have famous fun
at that moment a drop of wax fell on gavroches finger and recalled him
the deuce said he theres the wick giving out attention i cant
spend more than a sou a month on my lighting when a body goes to bed
he must sleep we havent the time to read m paul de kocks
romances and besides the light might pass through the cracks of the
porte cochere and all the bobbies need to do is to see it
and then remarked the elder timidly he alone dared talk to
gavroche and reply to him a spark might fall in the straw and we
must look out and not burn the house down
people dont say burn the house down remarked gavroche they say
the storm increased in violence and the heavy downpour beat upon the
back of the colossus amid claps of thunder youre taken in rain
said gavroche it amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of
the house winter is a stupid it wastes its merchandise it loses
its labor it cant wet us and that makes it kick up a row old
this allusion to the thunder all the consequences of which gavroche in
his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century accepted was
followed by a broad flash of lightning so dazzling that a hint of it
entered the belly of the elephant through the crack almost at the same
instant the thunder rumbled with great fury the two little creatures
uttered a shriek and started up so eagerly that the network came near
being displaced but gavroche turned his bold face to them and took
advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh
calm down children dont topple over the edifice thats fine
first class thunder all right thats no slouch of a streak of
lightning bravo for the good god deuce take it its almost as good as
that said he restored order in the netting pushed the two children
gently down on the bed pressed their knees in order to stretch them
since the good god is lighting his candle i can blow out mine now
babes now my young humans you must shut your peepers its very bad
not to sleep itll make you swallow the strainer or as they say in
fashionable society stink in the gullet wrap yourself up well in the
hide im going to put out the light are you ready
yes murmured the elder im all right i seem to have feathers under
people dont say head cried gavroche they say nut
the two children nestled close to each other gavroche finished
arranging them on the mat drew the blanket up to their very ears then
repeated for the third time his injunction in the hieratical tongue
hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began
to affect the netting under which the three children lay
it consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic
sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire this was
accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries
the little five year old boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and
chilled with terror jogged his brothers elbow but the elder brother
had already shut his peepers as gavroche had ordered then the little
one who could no longer control his terror questioned gavroche but in
a very low tone and with bated breath
hey said gavroche who had just closed his eyes
and he laid his head down on the mat again
the rats in fact who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the
elephant and who were the living black spots which we have already
mentioned had been held in awe by the flame of the candle so long as
it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern which was the same
as their city had returned to darkness scenting what the good
story teller perrault calls fresh meat they had hurled themselves in
throngs on gavroches tent had climbed to the top of it and had begun
to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new fangled trap
this explanation reassured the child a little he had seen white mice in
the course of his life and he was not afraid of them nevertheless he
i did have one replied gavroche i brought one here but they ate
this second explanation undid the work of the first and the little
the dialogue between him and gavroche began again for the fourth time
the child in consternation dismayed at the thought of mice which ate
the childs terror had reached its climax but gavroche added
dont be afraid they cant get in and besides im here here catch
hold of my hand hold your tongue and shut your peepers
at the same time gavroche grasped the little fellows hand across his
brother the child pressed the hand close to him and felt reassured
courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating
themselves silence reigned round them once more the sound of their
voices had frightened off the rats at the expiration of a few minutes
they came raging back but in vain the three little fellows were fast
the hours of the night fled away darkness covered the vast place de la
bastille a wintry gale which mingled with the rain blew in gusts the
patrol searched all the doorways alleys enclosures and obscure nooks
and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence
before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring open eyed
into the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good
deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping
in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must
remember that at that epoch the bastille guard house was situated at
the other end of the square and that what took place in the vicinity of
the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel
towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn a
man turned from the rue saint antoine at a run made the circuit of the
enclosure of the column of july and glided between the palings until he
was underneath the belly of the elephant if any light had illuminated
that man it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which
he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain arrived beneath
the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any
human tongue and which a paroquet alone could have imitated twice he
repeated this cry of whose orthography the following barely conveys an
at the second cry a clear young merry voice responded from the belly
almost immediately the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside
and gave passage to a child who descended the elephants leg and fell
briskly near the man it was gavroche the man was montparnasse
as for his cry of kirikikiou that was doubtless what the child had
on hearing it he had waked with a start had crawled out of his
alcove pushing apart the netting a little and carefully drawing it
together again then he had opened the trap and descended
the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom
we need you come lend us a hand
and both took their way towards the rue saint antoine whence
montparnasse had emerged winding rapidly through the long file of
market gardeners carts which descend towards the markets at that hour
the market gardeners crouching half asleep in their wagons amid the
salads and vegetables enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers
on account of the beating rain did not even glance at these strange
this is what had taken place that same night at the la force
an escape had been planned between babet brujon guelemer and
thenardier although thenardier was in close confinement babet had
arranged the matter for his own benefit on the same day as the reader
has seen from montparnasses account to gavroche montparnasse was to
brujon after having passed a month in the punishment cell had had
time in the first place to weave a rope in the second to mature a
plan in former times those severe places where the discipline of the
prison delivers the convict into his own hands were composed of four
stone walls a stone ceiling a flagged pavement a camp bed a grated
window and a door lined with iron and were called dungeons but the
dungeon was judged to be too terrible nowadays they are composed of an
iron door a grated window a camp bed a flagged pavement four stone
walls and a stone ceiling and are called chambers of punishment a
little light penetrates towards mid day the inconvenient point about
these chambers which as the reader sees are not dungeons is that they
allow the persons who should be at work to think
so brujon meditated and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with
a rope as he had the name of being very dangerous in the charlemagne
courtyard he was placed in the new building the first thing he found
in the new building was guelemer the second was a nail guelemer that
is to say crime a nail that is to say liberty brujon of whom it
is high time that the reader should have a complete idea was with an
appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor a
polished intelligent sprig and a thief who had a caressing glance
and an atrocious smile his glance resulted from his will and his
smile from his nature his first studies in his art had been directed
to roofs he had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear
off lead who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process
the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly
favorable for an attempt at escape was that the roofers were re laying
and re jointing at that very moment a portion of the slates on the
prison the saint bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated
from the charlemagne and the saint louis courts up above there were
scaffoldings and ladders in other words bridges and stairs in the
the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be
seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison the walls
were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been
obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood
because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on
the prisoners in their beds in spite of this antiquity the authorities
committed the error of confining in the new building the most
troublesome prisoners of placing there the hard cases as they say in
the new building contained four dormitories one above the other and a
top story which was called the bel air fine air a large chimney flue
probably from some ancient kitchen of the dukes de la force started
from the groundfloor traversed all four stories cut the dormitories
where it figured as a flattened pillar into two portions and finally
guelemer and brujon were in the same dormitory they had been placed by
way of precaution on the lower story chance ordained that the heads of
thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as
fine air the pedestrian who halts on the rue culture sainte catherine
after passing the barracks of the firemen in front of the porte cochere
of the bathing establishment beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs
in wooden boxes at the extremity of which spreads out a little white
rotunda with two wings brightened up with green shutters the bucolic
not more than ten years ago there rose above that rotunda an enormous
black hideous bare wall by which it was backed up
this was the outer wall of la force
this wall beside that rotunda was milton viewed through berquin
lofty as it was this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof which
could be seen beyond this was the roof of the new building there
one could descry four dormer windows guarded with bars they were the
a chimney pierced the roof this was the chimney which traversed the
the bel air that top story of the new building was a sort of large
hall with a mansard roof guarded with triple gratings and double doors
of sheet iron which were studded with enormous bolts when one entered
from the north end one had on ones left the four dormer windows on
ones right facing the windows at regular intervals four square
tolerably vast cages separated by narrow passages built of masonry
to about the height of the elbow and the rest up to the roof of iron
thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since
the night of the 3d of february no one was ever able to discover how
and by what connivance he succeeded in procuring and secreting a
bottle of wine invented so it is said by desrues with which
a narcotic is mixed and which the band of the endormeurs or
there are in many prisons treacherous employees half jailers
half thieves who assist in escapes who sell to the police an
unfaithful service and who turn a penny whenever they can
on that same night then when little gavroche picked up the two lost
children brujon and guelemer who knew that babet who had escaped that
morning was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse
rose softly and with the nail which brujon had found began to pierce
the chimney against which their beds stood the rubbish fell on brujons
bed so that they were not heard showers mingled with thunder shook
the doors on their hinges and created in the prison a terrible and
opportune uproar those of the prisoners who woke pretended to fall
asleep again and left guelemer and brujon to their own devices brujon
was adroit guelemer was vigorous before any sound had reached the
watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the
dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scaled the iron
grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced and the two
redoubtable ruffians were on the roof the wind and rain redoubled the
what a good night to leg it said brujon
an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the
surrounding wall at the bottom of this abyss they could see the musket
of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom they fastened one end of the
rope which brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars
which they had just wrenched off flung the other over the outer wall
crossed the abyss at one bound clung to the coping of the wall got
astride of it let themselves slip one after the other along the rope
upon a little roof which touches the bath house pulled their rope after
