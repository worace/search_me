chapter vi the two old men do everything each one after his own
everything was made ready for the wedding the doctor on being
consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then
december a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed
the grandfather was not the least happy of them all he remained for a
quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette
the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed and she has so sweet and
good an air she is without exception the most charming girl that i
have ever seen in my life later on shell have virtues with an odor of
violets how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such
a creature marius my boy you are a baron you are rich dont go to
cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise
the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned
do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette
no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring
jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged
everything made everything easy he hastened towards cosettes
happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as
as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate
problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted cosettes
civil status if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might
prevent the marriage who knows he extricated cosette from all
difficulties he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means
of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an
extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of
the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to
the convent of the petit picpus inquiry was made at that convent the
very best information and the most respectable references abounded the
good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of
paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never
understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the
daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal an
acte de notoriete was drawn up cosette became in the eyes of the law
mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent she was declared an orphan both
father and mother being dead jean valjean so arranged it that he was
appointed under the name of fauchelevent as cosettes guardian with
as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted
a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to
remain unknown the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and
ninety four thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended
on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that
amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in
the hands of a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her
majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was
very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum
due was half a million there were some peculiarities here and there
it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties
had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand
cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she
had so long called father he was merely a kinsman another fauchelevent
was her real father at any other time this would have broken her heart
but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it cast
but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the
cloud did not last long she had marius the young man arrived the old
and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas
around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always
nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean father
cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father gillenormand
it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and
presents while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal
situation in society and an unassailable status m gillenormand was
superintending the basket of wedding gifts nothing so amused him as
being magnificent he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure
which had descended to him from his own grandmother
these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the
rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my
he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with
swelling fronts which had not been opened for years let us hear the
confession of these dowagers he said let us see what they have in
their paunches he noisily violated the pot bellied drawers of all
his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers pekins
damasks lampas painted moires robes of shot gros de tours india
kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed dauphines without a
right or wrong side in the piece genoa and alencon point lace
parures in antique goldsmiths work ivory bon bon boxes ornamented
with microscopic battles gewgaws and ribbons he lavished everything on
cosette cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with
gratitude towards m gillenormand dreamed of a happiness without limit
clothed in satin and velvet her wedding basket seemed to her to be
upheld by seraphim her soul flew out into the azure depths with wings
the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already
said by the ecstasy of the grandfather a sort of flourish of trumpets
went on in the rue des filles du calvaire
every morning a fresh offering of bric a brac from the grandfather to
one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his
bliss said apropos of i know not what incident
the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of
the ages like cato and like phocion and each one of them seems to me
moire antique exclaimed the old gentleman thanks marius that is
precisely the idea of which i was in search
and on the following day a magnificent dress of tea rose colored moire
from these fripperies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom
love is all very well but there must be something else to go with
it the useless must be mingled with happiness happiness is only the
necessary season that enormously with the superfluous for me a
palace and her heart her heart and the louvre her heart and the grand
waterworks of versailles give me my shepherdess and try to make her a
duchess fetch me phyllis crowned with corn flowers and add a hundred
thousand francs income open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you
can see beneath a marble colonnade i consent to the bucolic and also
to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold dry happiness resembles dry
bread one eats but one does not dine i want the superfluous the
useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose i
remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall
as a three story house which marked the hours which had the kindness to
indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and
which after having struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the
sun or midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like
gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and
fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a
niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and
eponine and sabinus and a throng of little gilded goodmen who played
on the trumpet to boot without reckoning delicious chimes which it
sprinkled through the air on every occasion without any ones knowing
why is a petty bald clock face which merely tells the hour equal to
that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg
and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest
m gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding and all
the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell mell through his
you are ignorant of the art of festivals you do not know how to
organize a day of enjoyment in this age he exclaimed your nineteenth
century is weak it lacks excess it ignores the rich it ignores the
noble in everything it is clean shaven your third estate is insipid
colorless odorless and shapeless the dreams of your bourgeois who
set up as they express it a pretty boudoir freshly decorated violet
ebony and calico make way make way the sieur curmudgeon is marrying
mademoiselle clutch penny sumptuousness and splendor a louis dor has
been stuck to a candle theres the epoch for you my demand is that i
may flee from it beyond the sarmatians ah in 1787 i predict that all
was lost from the day when i beheld the duc de rohan prince de leon
duc de chabot duc de montbazon marquis de sonbise vicomte de thouars
peer of france go to longchamps in a tapecu that has borne its fruits
in this century men attend to business they gamble on change they
win money they are stingy people take care of their surfaces and
varnish them every one is dressed as though just out of a band box
washed soaped scraped shaved combed waked smoothed rubbed
brushed cleaned on the outside irreproachable polished as a pebble
discreet neat and at the same time death of my life in the depths of
their consciences they have dung heaps and cesspools that are enough to
make a cow herd who blows his nose in his fingers recoil i grant to
this age the device dirty cleanliness dont be vexed marius give
me permission to speak i say no evil of the people as you see i am
always harping on your people but do look favorably on my dealing a bit
of a slap to the bourgeoisie i belong to it he who loves well lashes
well thereupon i say plainly that now a days people marry but that
they no longer know how to marry ah it is true i regret the grace
of the ancient manners i regret everything about them their elegance
their chivalry those courteous and delicate ways that joyous luxury
which every one possessed music forming part of the wedding a symphony
above stairs a beating of drums below stairs the dances the joyous
faces round the table the fine spun gallant compliments the songs the
fireworks the frank laughter the devils own row the huge knots of
ribbon i regret the brides garter the brides garter is cousin to the
girdle of venus on what does the war of troy turn on helens garter
parbleu why did they fight why did diomed the divine break over
the head of meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points why did
achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances
because helen allowed paris to take her garter with cosettes garter
homer would construct the iliad he would put in his poem a loquacious
old fellow like me and he would call him nestor my friends in bygone
days in those amiable days of yore people married wisely they had a
good contract and then they had a good carouse as soon as cujas had
taken his departure gamacho entered but in sooth the stomach is
an agreeable beast which demands its due and which wants to have its
wedding also people supped well and had at table a beautiful neighbor
without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed oh
the large laughing mouths and how gay we were in those days youth was
a bouquet every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft
of roses whether he was a shepherd or a warrior and if by chance
one was a captain of dragoons one found means to call oneself florian
people thought much of looking well they embroidered and tinted
themselves a bourgeois had the air of a flower a marquis had the air
of a precious stone people had no straps to their boots they had no
boots they were spruce shining waved lustrous fluttering dainty
coquettish which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their
sides the humming bird has beak and claws that was the day of the
galland indies one of the sides of that century was delicate the other
was magnificent and by the green cabbages people amused themselves
to day people are serious the bourgeois is avaricious the bourgeoise
is a prude your century is unfortunate people would drive away the
graces as being too low in the neck alas beauty is concealed as
though it were ugliness since the revolution everything including the
ballet dancers has had its trousers a mountebank dancer must be grave
your rigadoons are doctrinarian it is necessary to be majestic people
would be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their
cravats the ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries is to
resemble m royer collard and do you know what one arrives at with
that majesty at being petty learn this joy is not only joyous it is
great but be in love gayly then what the deuce marry when you marry
with fever and giddiness and tumult and the uproar of happiness be
grave in church well and good but as soon as the mass is finished
sarpejou you must make a dream whirl around the bride a marriage
should be royal and chimerical it should promenade its ceremony from
the cathedral of rheims to the pagoda of chanteloup i have a horror
of a paltry wedding ventregoulette be in olympus for that one day
at least be one of the gods ah people might be sylphs games and
laughter argiraspides they are stupids my friends every recently
made bridegroom ought to be prince aldobrandini profit by that unique
minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the
eagles even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the
bourgeoisie of the frogs dont economize on the nuptials do not prune
them of their splendors dont scrimp on the day when you beam the
wedding is not the housekeeping oh if i were to carry out my fancy
it would be gallant violins would be heard under the trees here is
my programme sky blue and silver i would mingle with the festival
the rural divinities i would convoke the dryads and the nereids the
nuptials of amphitrite a rosy cloud nymphs with well dressed locks
and entirely naked an academician offering quatrains to the goddess a
triton trottait devant et tirait de sa conque
theres a festive programme theres a good one or else i know
while the grandfather in full lyrical effusion was listening to
himself cosette and marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at
aunt gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity
within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount
of emotions marius returned marius brought back bleeding marius
brought back from a barricade marius dead then living marius
reconciled marius betrothed marius wedding a poor girl marius wedding
a millionairess the six hundred thousand francs had been her last
surprise then her indifference of a girl taking her first communion
returned to her she went regularly to service told her beads read her
euchology mumbled aves in one corner of the house while i love you
was being whispered in the other and she beheld marius and cosette in a
vague way like two shadows the shadow was herself
there is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul
neutralized by torpor a stranger to that which may be designated as the
business of living receives no impressions either human or pleasant
or painful with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes this
devotion as father gillenormand said to his daughter corresponds to
a cold in the head you smell nothing of life neither any bad nor any
moreover the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly
spinsters indecision her father had acquired the habit of taking her
so little into account that he had not consulted her in the matter of
consent to marius marriage he had acted impetuously according to his
wont having a despot turned slave but a single thought to satisfy
marius as for the aunt it had not even occurred to him that the aunt
existed and that she could have an opinion of her own and sheep as
she was this had vexed her somewhat resentful in her inmost soul but
impassive externally she had said to herself my father has settled
the question of the marriage without reference to me i shall settle the
question of the inheritance without consulting him she was rich in
fact and her father was not she had reserved her decision on this
point it is probable that had the match been a poor one she would
have left him poor so much the worse for my nephew he is wedding a
beggar let him be a beggar himself but cosettes half million pleased
the aunt and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers
were concerned one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand
francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave
her fortune to these young people since they did not need it
it was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather m
gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber the finest in
the house that will make me young again he said its an old plan
of mine i have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my
he furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles he had
the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff which he had by
him in the piece and which he believed to have emanated from utrecht
with a buttercup colored satin ground covered with velvet auricula
blossoms it was with that stuff said he that the bed of the
duchesse danville at la roche guyon was draped on the chimney piece
he set a little figure in saxe porcelain carrying a muff against her
m gillenormands library became the lawyers study which marius
needed a study it will be remembered being required by the council of
chapter vii the effects of dreams mingled with happiness
the lovers saw each other every day cosette came with m
gillenormand to have the bride come to the house to do the courting
like this but marius convalescence had caused the habit to become
established and the arm chairs of the rue des filles du calvaire
better adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the rue de lhomme
arme had rooted it marius and m fauchelevent saw each other but did
not address each other it seemed as though this had been agreed upon
every girl needs a chaperon cosette could not have come without
m fauchelevent in marius eyes m fauchelevent was the condition
attached to cosette he accepted it by dint of discussing political
matters vaguely and without precision from the point of view of the
general amelioration of the fate of all men they came to say a little
more than yes and no once on the subject of education which
marius wished to have free and obligatory multiplied under all forms
lavished on every one like the air and the sun in a word respirable
for the entire population they were in unison and they almost
conversed m fauchelevent talked well and even with a certain
loftiness of language still he lacked something indescribable m
fauchelevent possessed something less and also something more than a
marius inwardly and in the depths of his thought surrounded with
all sorts of mute questions this m fauchelevent who was to him simply
benevolent and cold there were moments when doubts as to his own
recollections occurred to him there was a void in his memory a black
spot an abyss excavated by four months of agony many things had been
lost therein he had come to the point of asking himself whether it were
really a fact that he had seen m fauchelevent so serious and so calm a
this was not however the only stupor which the apparitions and the
disappearances of the past had left in his mind it must not be supposed
that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which
force us even when happy even when satisfied to glance sadly behind
us the head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have
vanished contains neither thought nor love at times marius clasped his
face between his hands and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the
twilight which reigned in his brain again he beheld mabeuf fall he
heard gavroche singing amid the grape shot he felt beneath his lips the
cold brow of eponine enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire combeferre
bossuet grantaire all his friends rose erect before him then
dispersed into thin air were all those dear sorrowful valiant
charming or tragic beings merely dreams had they actually existed the
revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke these great fevers create
great dreams he questioned himself he felt himself all these vanished
realities made him dizzy where were they all then was it really true
that all were dead a fall into the shadows had carried off all except
himself it all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the
curtain of a theatre there are curtains like this which drop in life
and he himself was he actually the same man he the poor man was
rich he the abandoned had a family he the despairing was to marry
cosette it seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb and that he had
entered into it black and had emerged from it white and in that tomb
the others had remained at certain moments all these beings of the
past returned and present formed a circle around him and overshadowed
him then he thought of cosette and recovered his serenity but nothing
less than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe
m fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings
marius hesitated to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was
the same as this fauchelevent in flesh and blood sitting so gravely
beside cosette the first was probably one of those nightmares
occasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium however
the natures of both men were rigid no question from marius to m
fauchelevent was possible such an idea had not even occurred to him we
two men who have a secret in common and who by a sort of tacit
agreement exchange not a word on the subject are less rare than is
once only did marius make the attempt he introduced into the
conversation the rue de la chanvrerie and turning to m fauchelevent
of course you are acquainted with that street
i have no idea of the name of that street replied m fauchelevent in
the response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the
street itself appeared to marius to be more conclusive than it really
decidedly thought he i have been dreaming i have been subject to
a hallucination it was some one who resembled him m fauchelevent was
marius enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind
while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed
upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be
he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his fathers
there was thenardier there was the unknown man who had brought him
marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to
be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of
gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which
it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind
him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain
that thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he
had saved colonel pontmercy thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all
and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of waterloo
was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as
thenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted
to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any
none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering
any trace of thenardier obliteration appeared to be complete in
that quarter madame thenardier had died in prison pending the trial
thenardier and his daughter azelma the only two remaining of that
lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom the gulf of the
social unknown had silently closed above those beings on the surface
there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those
obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in
madame thenardier being dead boulatruelle being eliminated from the
case claquesous having disappeared the principal persons accused
having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the
that affair had remained rather obscure the bench of assizes had been
obliged to content themselves with two subordinates panchaud alias
printanier alias bigrenaille and demi liard alias deux milliards who
had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of
the case to ten years in the galleys hard labor for life had been the
sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices
thenardier the head and leader had been through contumacy likewise
this sentence was the only information remaining about thenardier
casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a
moreover by thrusting thenardier back into the very remotest depths
through a fear of being re captured this sentence added to the density
as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius
the researches were at first to some extent successful then came to
an abrupt conclusion they succeeded in finding the carriage which had
brought marius to the rue des filles du calvaire on the evening of the
the coachman declared that on the 6th of june in obedience to the
commands of a police agent he had stood from three oclock in the
afternoon until nightfall on the quai des champs elysees above the
outlet of the grand sewer that towards nine oclock in the evening
the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had
opened that a man had emerged therefrom bearing on his shoulders
another man who seemed to be dead that the agent who was on the watch
at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man
that at the order of the police agent he the coachman had taken all
those folks into his carriage that they had first driven to the rue
des filles du calvaire that they had there deposited the dead man that
the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized
him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards they
had entered the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horses a few
paces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt
that there in the street they had paid him and left him and that the
police agent had led the other man away that he knew nothing more that
marius as we have said recalled nothing he only remembered that he
had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he
was falling backwards into the barricade then everything vanished so
he had only regained consciousness at m gillenormands
he could not doubt his own identity still how had it come to pass
that having fallen in the rue de la chanvrerie he had been picked
up by the police agent on the banks of the seine near the pont des
some one had carried him from the quartier des halles to the
champs elysees and how through the sewer unheard of devotion
this was the man for whom marius was searching
of this man who was his savior nothing not a trace not the faintest
marius although forced to preserve great reserve in that direction
pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police there no more
than elsewhere did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment
the prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney coachman
they had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of june
no report of any agent had been received there upon this matter which
was regarded at the prefecture as a fable the invention of this fable
a coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything even of
imagination the fact was assured nevertheless and marius could not
doubt it unless he doubted his own identity as we have just said
what had become of that man that mysterious man whom the coachman had
seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back
the unconscious marius and whom the police agent on the watch had
arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent what had become of
why had this agent preserved silence had the man succeeded in making
his escape had he bribed the agent why did this man give no sign of
life to marius who owed everything to him his disinterestedness was no
less tremendous than his devotion why had not that man appeared again
perhaps he was above compensation but no one is above gratitude was he
dead who was the man what sort of a face had he no one could tell him
the coachman answered the night was very dark basque and nicolette
all in a flutter had looked only at their young master all covered with
the porter whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of marius had
been the only one to take note of the man in question and this is the
marius had the blood stained clothing which he had worn when he had been
brought back to his grandfather preserved in the hope that it would
on examining the coat it was found that one skirt had been torn in a
one evening marius was speaking in the presence of cosette and jean
valjean of the whole of that singular adventure of the innumerable
inquiries which he had made and of the fruitlessness of his efforts
the cold countenance of monsieur fauchelevent angered him
he exclaimed with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it
yes that man whoever he may have been was sublime do you know what
he did sir he intervened like an archangel he must have flung himself
into the midst of the battle have stolen me away have opened the
sewer have dragged me into it and have carried me through it he
must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful
subterranean galleries bent over weighed down in the dark in the
cess pool more than a league and a half sir with a corpse upon his
back and with what object with the sole object of saving the corpse
and that corpse i was he said to himself there may still be a
glimpse of life there perchance i will risk my own existence for that
miserable spark and his existence he risked not once but twenty times
and every step was a danger the proof of it is that on emerging from
the sewer he was arrested do you know sir that that man did all
this and he had no recompense to expect what was i an insurgent
what was i one of the conquered oh if cosettes six hundred thousand
well resumed marius i would give them all to find that man once
the night of the 16th to the 17th of february 1833 was a blessed
night above its shadows heaven stood open it was the wedding night of
it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy
spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the
bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be
placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling
the manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to day france
had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off
ones wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with
shame from ones happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with
the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the
full the chastity exquisiteness and decency of jolting their paradise
in a posting chaise of breaking up their mystery with clic clacs of
taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn and of leaving behind them
in a commonplace chamber at such a night the most sacred of
the souvenirs of life mingled pell mell with the tete a tete of the
conductor of the diligence and the maid servant of the inn
in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now
living the mayor and his scarf the priest and his chasuble the law
and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion de
lonjumeau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons
a plaque like a vantbrace knee breeches of green leather oaths to the
norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished
hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does
not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility
and raining down on the post chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm
of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn out shoes in memory of
churchill afterwards marlborough or malbrouck who was assailed on
his wedding day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck
old shoes and slippers do not as yet form a part of our nuptial
celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall
in 1833 a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot
strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was
a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not
spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be
honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a
good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence
a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the
household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness
and people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes
the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now
natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to
publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church
produce some complication they could not get ready before the 16th of
now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it
chanced that the 16th fell on shrove tuesday hesitations scruples
shrove tuesday exclaimed the grandfather so much the better there
let us proceed here goes for the 16th do you want to delay marius
accordingly the marriage took place on the 16th notwithstanding the
public merrymaking it rained that day but there is always in the sky
a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even
when the rest of creation is under an umbrella
on the preceding evening jean valjean handed to marius in the presence
of m gillenormand the five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of
henceforth toussaint was of no use to jean valjean cosette inherited
her and promoted her to the rank of ladys maid
as for jean valjean a beautiful chamber in the gillenormand house had
been furnished expressly for him and cosette had said to him in such
an irresistible manner father i entreat you that she had almost
persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it
a few days before that fixed on for the marriage an accident happened
to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand this was not a
serious matter and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself
about it nor to dress it nor even to see his hurt not even cosette
nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage
and to carry his arm in a sling and had prevented his signing m
gillenormand in his capacity of cosettes supervising guardian had
we will not conduct the reader either to the mayors office or to the
church one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent and one is
accustomed to turn ones back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding
nosegay in its buttonhole we will confine ourselves to noting an
incident which though unnoticed by the wedding party marked the
transit from the rue des filles du calvaire to the church of saint paul
at that epoch the northern extremity of the rue saint louis was in
process of repaving it was barred off beginning with the rue du
pare royal it was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly
to saint paul they were obliged to alter their course and the simplest
way was to turn through the boulevard one of the invited guests
observed that it was shrove tuesday and that there would be a jam
of vehicles why asked m gillenormand because of the
maskers capital said the grandfather let us go that way these
young folks are on the way to be married they are about to enter the
serious part of life this will prepare them for seeing a bit of the
they went by way of the boulevard the first wedding coach held cosette
and aunt gillenormand m gillenormand and jean valjean marius still
separated from his betrothed according to usage did not come until
the second the nuptial train on emerging from the rue des
filles du calvaire became entangled in a long procession of vehicles
which formed an endless chain from the madeleine to the bastille and
from the bastille to the madeleine maskers abounded on the boulevard
in spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals merry andrew
pantaloon and clown persisted in the good humor of that winter of 1833
paris had disguised itself as venice such shrove tuesdays are no
longer to be seen now a days everything which exists being a scattered
the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with
curious spectators the terraces which crown the peristyles of the
theatres were bordered with spectators besides the maskers they stared
at that procession peculiar to shrove tuesday as to longchamps of
cabriolets marching in order rigorously riveted to each other by the
police regulations and locked into rails as it were any one in
these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle police sergeants
maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable
parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that
nothing interfered with that double current those two brooks of
carriages flowing the one down stream the other up stream the
one towards the chaussee dantin the other towards the faubourg
saint antoine the carriages of the peers of france and of the
ambassadors emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way
going and coming freely certain joyous and magnificent trains notably
that of the boeuf gras had the same privilege in this gayety of paris
england cracked her whip lord seymours post chaise harassed by a
nickname from the populace passed with great noise
in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like
sheep dogs honest family coaches loaded down with great aunts and
grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in
disguise clowns of seven years of age columbines of six ravishing
little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the
public mirth who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade
from time to time a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of
vehicles one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot
was disentangled one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole
line then they set out again on the march
the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the bastille
and skirting the right side of the boulevard at the top of the
pont aux choux there was a stoppage nearly at the same moment the
other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also at
that point of the file there was a carriage load of maskers
these carriages or to speak more correctly these wagon loads of
maskers are very familiar to parisians if they were missing on a shrove
tuesday or at the mid lent it would be taken in bad part and people
would say theres something behind that probably the ministry
is about to undergo a change a pile of cassandras harlequins and
columbines jolted along high above the passers by all possible
grotesquenesses from the turk to the savage hercules supporting
marquises fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just
as the maenads made aristophanes drop his eyes tow wigs pink tights
dandified hats spectacles of a grimacer three cornered hats of janot
tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists on
hips bold attitudes bare shoulders immodesty unchained a chaos of
shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers this is what
greece stood in need of the chariot of thespis france stands in need of
everything can be parodied even parody the saturnalia that grimace of
antique beauty ends through exaggeration after exaggeration in shrove
tuesday and the bacchanal formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves
and grapes inundated with sunshine displaying her marble breast in a
divine semi nudity having at the present day lost her shape under
the soaked rags of the north has finally come to be called the
the tradition of carriage loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient
days of the monarchy the accounts of louis xi allot to the bailiff of
the palace twenty sous tournois for three coaches of mascarades
in the cross roads in our day these noisy heaps of creatures are
accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage
whose imperial they load down or they overwhelm a hired landau with
its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups twenty of them ride
in a carriage intended for six they cling to the seats to the rumble
on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts they even bestride the
carriage lamps they stand sit lie with their knees drawn up in a
knot and their legs hanging the women sit on the mens laps far
away above the throng of heads their wild pyramid is visible these
carriage loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout colle
panard and piron flow from it enriched with slang this carriage which
has become colossal through its freight has an air of conquest uproar
reigns in front tumult behind people vociferate shout howl there
they break forth and writhe with enjoyment gayety roars sarcasm flames
forth joviality is flaunted like a red flag two jades there drag farce
blossomed forth into an apotheosis it is the triumphal car of laughter
a laughter that is too cynical to be frank in truth this laughter is
suspicious this laughter has a mission it is charged with proving the
these fishwife vehicles in which one feels one knows not what shadows
set the philosopher to thinking there is government therein there one
lays ones finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public
it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total
of gayety that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should
be enticed that the system of spying and serving as caryatids to
prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them that the
crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags half
dung half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they
should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames that there
would be no festival for the populace did not the police promenade in
their midst these sorts of twenty headed hydras of joy but what can be
done about it these be ribboned and be flowered tumbrils of mire are
insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public the laughter of all
is the accomplice of universal degradation certain unhealthy festivals
disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace and
populaces like tyrants require buffoons the king has roquelaure
the populace has the merry andrew paris is a great mad city on every
occasion that it is a great sublime city there the carnival forms
part of politics paris let us confess it willingly allows infamy to
furnish it with comedy she only demands of her masters when she has
masters one thing paint me the mud rome was of the same mind she
chance ordained as we have just said that one of these shapeless
clusters of masked men and women dragged about on a vast calash should
halt on the left of the boulevard while the wedding train halted on the
right the carriage load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage
containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the
a sham wedding retorted another we are the genuine article
and being too far off to accost the wedding party and fearing also
the rebuke of the police the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere
at the end of another minute the carriage load of maskers had their
hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the crowds caress
to masquerades and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the
throng with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of
projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous
verbal attacks of the populace a frightful exchange of metaphors took
in the meanwhile two other maskers in the same carriage a spaniard
with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and a
gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl masked with a loup67 had
also noticed the wedding and while their companions and the passers by
were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice
their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it the gusts of
rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open the
breezes of february are not warm as the fishwife clad in a low necked
gown replied to the spaniard she shivered laughed and coughed
yonder in the first wedding cart on our side
the one with his arm hung up in a black cravat
im willing that they should cut my throat and im ready to swear that
i never said either you thou or i in my life if i dont know that
can you see the bride if you stoop down
try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low
never mind that old cove who has something the matter with his paw i
and what good does it do to know him
i dont care a hang for old fellows that i dont
how the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party
get off of our trap and spin that wedding
to find out where it goes and what it is hurry up and jump down
