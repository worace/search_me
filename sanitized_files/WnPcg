bear up it wont be for long now well see our visitors off and then
well rest the tsar wont forget your service it is hard for you but
still you are at home while they you see what they have come to said
he pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggars
while they were strong we didnt spare ourselves but now we may even
pity them they are human beings too isnt it so lads
he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed
upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew brighter
and brighter with an old mans mild smile which drew the corners of his
lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased speaking and bowed
but after all who asked them here serves them right the bloody
and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time
during the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldiers
kutuzovs words were hardly understood by the troops no one could have
repeated the field marshals address begun solemnly and then changing
into an old mans simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of that
speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
and consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by that
old mans good natured expletives was not merely understood but lay in
the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long
sustained shouts afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov
asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for kutuzov in
answering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly moved
when the troops reached their nights halting place on the eighth of
november the last day of the krasnoe battles it was already growing
dusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
falling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the falling
snow a purple black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew
an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but
now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night
at its halting place a village on the highroad the quartermasters who
met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
frenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one hut
the commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through the
village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts
like some huge many limbed animal the regiment began to prepare its
lair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded knee deep through
the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village and
immediately the sound of axes and swords the crashing of branches and
merry voices could be heard from there another section amid the
regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
getting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a third
section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
officers carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts and
dragging away boards dry wood and thatch from the roofs for the
campfires or wattle fences to serve for shelter
some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
wall of a shed the roof of which had already been removed
now then all together shove cried the voices and the huge surface
of the wall sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost was seen
swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more and
more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had been pushing
it loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued
now then catch hold in twos hand up the lever thats it where are
now all together but wait a moment boys with a song
all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to sing at
the end of the third verse as the last note died away twenty voices
roared out at once oo oo oo oo thats it all together heave away
boys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved and
in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible
here you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a hand
will you you may want us one of these days
some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the
village joined the haulers and the wattle wall which was about thirty
five feet long and seven feet high moved forward along the village
street swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping
get along falling what are you stopping for there now
what are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden
there are gentry here the general himself is in that hut and you
foul mouthed devils you brutes ill give it to you shouted he
hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back
the men became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped
his face which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against
there how that devil hits out hes made my face all bloody said he
in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on
dont you like it said a laughing voice and moderating their tones
when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as
before interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives
in the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered and
were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the
maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank march
to the left cut off the vice king murat and capture him
by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the
campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the wood
crackled the snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers flitted to
and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden
axes and choppers were plied all around everything was done without any
orders being given stores of wood were brought for the night shelters
were rigged up for the officers caldrons were being boiled and muskets
the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
eighth company as a shelter from the north propped up by musket rests
and a campfire was built before it they beat the tattoo called the
roll had supper and settled down round the fires for the night some
repairing their footgear some smoking pipes and some stripping
themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts
one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
conditions the russian soldiers were in at that time lacking warm boots
and sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the snow with
eighteen degrees of frost and without even full rations the
commissariat did not always keep up with the troops they would have
on the contrary the army had never under the best material conditions
presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all who
began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army
day by day all the physically or morally weak had long since been left
behind and only the flower of the army physically and mentally
more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than
anywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
campfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by their wattle
eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost or
have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a red haired
and red faced man screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the
smoke but not moving back from the fire and you jackdaw go and fetch
this red haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being
robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they
called jackdaw a thin little fellow with a sharp nose rose
obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the
light of the fire the slender handsome figure of a young soldier
they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with
their mouths and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats making
the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit their pipes
the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood setting his arms
akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot
mother the dew is cold but clear its well that im a
musketeer he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable
look out your soles will fly off shouted the red haired man
noticing that the sole of the dancers boot was hanging loose what a
the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it
right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his
knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot
its the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet
theyll soon be issuing us new ones they say that when weve finished
and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems
ive had an eye on him this long while said the other
but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday
yes its all very well but when a mans feet are frozen how can he
eh dont talk nonsense said a sergeant major
do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning
reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet
well you know said the sharp nosed man they called jackdaw in a
squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the
fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one its death take me
now ive got no strength left he added with sudden resolution
turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital im
aching all over anyway i shant be able to keep up
thatll do thatll do replied the sergeant major quietly
the soldier said no more and the talk went on
what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that
not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier
starting a new theme they were no more than make believes
the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the
colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in
the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would
you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo
but theyre a clean folk lads the first man went on he was white
as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows you might
well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there
but they dont understand our talk at all said the dancer with a
puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his
but its strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their
whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began
burying the dead where the battle was you know well those dead had
been lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as
white as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder
youre a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it
had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he
says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says
we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper
and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder
it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to
that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all
called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and
still didnt finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he
that was a real battle said an old soldier its the only one worth
remembering but since that its only been tormenting folk
and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my
word they didnt let us get near before they just threw down their
muskets and went on their knees pardon they say thats only one
case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he didnt know the
right charm he catches him and catches him no good he turns into a
bird in his hands and flies away and theres no way of killing him
youre a first class liar kiselev when i come to look at you
if he fell into my hands when id caught him id bury him in the
ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of men hes
well anyhow were going to end it he wont come here again remarked
the conversation flagged and the soldiers began settling down to sleep
look at the stars its wonderful how they shine you would think the
women had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing with
thats a sign of a good harvest next year
you warm your back and your belly gets frozen thats queer
what are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how hes
in the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleep
could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and again
exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the
soldiers and what a lot of them there are
one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company
theyre having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have
turned up ones quite frozen and the others an awful swaggerer hes
oh ill go across and have a look
and several of the men went over to the fifth company
the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest a huge
campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up the
about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest
a bear lads said one of the men
they all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into the
bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to
these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they came up
to the fire hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
not understand one was taller than the other he wore an officers hat
and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been going to
sit down but fell the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied
round his head was stronger he raised his companion and said
something pointing to his mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen
spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man and brought some
buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them
the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head
wrapped in the shawl was morel his orderly
when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
soldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food and
resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking at
the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted a
long drawn groan and then again became silent morel pointing to his
shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was
an officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer who had come up to
the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french
officer into his hut to warm him and when the messenger returned and
said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballe
was told to go he rose and tried to walk but staggered and would have
fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up
you wont do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking and
oh you fool why talk rubbish lout that you are a real peasant
came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier
they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of two
soldiers and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around their
necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively
oh you fine fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh my
brave kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded by
morel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes was
wearing a womans cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french song
in a hoarse broken voice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier
the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him
now then now then teach us how it goes ill soon pick it up how is
it said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing
vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sang morel winking ce
 long live henry the fourth that valiant king that rowdy devil
vivarika vif seruvaru sedyablyaka repeated the soldier flourishing
bravo ha ha ha rose their rough joyous laughter from all sides
qui eut le triple talent de boire de battre et detre un vert
 who had a triple talent for drinking for fighting and for being a
ke zaletaev brought out with effort ke e e e he drawled
laboriously pursing his lips le trip ta la de bu de ba e de tra va
fine just like the frenchie oh ho ho do you want some more to eat
give him some porridge it takes a long time to get filled up after
they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on
his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him
the older men who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire but one
would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a
they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
coat even wormwood grows on its own root
o lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hard
they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was looking
at them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring up
now vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering something
the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
progression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has
been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not
at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and
still is written about the berezina on the french side this is only
because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the
russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a
plan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch napoleon in a
strategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured himself that all
would happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was just
the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality
the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in
guns and men lost than krasnoe had been as the figures show
the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
cutting off the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possible
line of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army
demanded namely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fled
at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible
to block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it
made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges
broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with children
who were with the french transport all carried on by vis inertiae
pressed forward into boats and into the ice covered water and did not
that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers
was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each
might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held
among them but those who surrendered while remaining in the same
pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
necessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the fact
that half the prisoners with whom the russians did not know what to do
perished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save them
they felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate russian
commanders those favorable to the french and even the frenchmen in the
russian service could do nothing for the prisoners the french perished
from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed it was
impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable
soldiers to give to the french who though not harmful or hated or
guilty were simply unnecessary some russians even did that but they
certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope
their ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collective
flight and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated
the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
remnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of the
petersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the russians and the
keener grew the passions of the russian commanders who blamed one
another and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the
petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led to
dissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more strongly
expressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
respectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to
blame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or
asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
formality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it
was useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the
profundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases which
they thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about the
impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions
and so forth they had heard all that before and all he said that it
was necessary to await provisions or that the men had no boots was so
simple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that it
was evident that he was old and stupid and that they though not in
after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg
hero wittgenstein this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their
maximum kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders
only once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and write
to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the following
on account of your spells of ill health will your excellency please be
so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and there await
further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty
but after bennigsens departure the grand duke tsarevich constantine
pavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of the
campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov now
having come to the army he informed kutuzov of the emperors
displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their
advance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days
the old man experienced in court as well as in military affairs this
same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against
the sovereigns wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heir
apparent from the army who on his own authority and contrary to the
emperors will had decided on the abandonment of moscow now realized at
once that his day was over that his part was played and that the power
he was supposed to hold was no longer his and he understood this not
merely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that the
military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt
that his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be
conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the
on the twenty ninth of november kutuzov entered vilna his dear vilna
as he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been governor of
vilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old
friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had
so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and
state and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed
immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
done in the realm of history did not concern him at all
chichagov one of the most zealous cutters off and breakers up who
had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but
never wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldness
with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutuzov to be
under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with
turkey in 1811 independently of kutuzov and found that peace had
already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of
securing that peace was really kutuzovs this chichagov was the first
to meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress
naval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handed
kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously
respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was
expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who knew
of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov
when speaking to chichagov kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the
vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov
had been recovered and would be restored to him
you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the
contrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to give
dinner parties warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word he
spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be
kutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetrating
smile i meant merely to say what i said
contrary to the emperors wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the
army at vilna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
and physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to army
affairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaiting
having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count
tolstoy prince volkonski arakcheev and others the emperor reached
vilna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the
castle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff
officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well as
a guard of honor of the semenov regiment
a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with three
foam flecked horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into the
vestibule to inform kutuzov who was waiting in the hall porters little
a minute later the old mans large stout figure in full dress uniform
his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach
waddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to the
sides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
sideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand the
there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka flew
furiously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in
which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be
from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect
on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over
readjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and at
the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh
lifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in his
the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to foot
frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the
old man extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too owing
to a long standing impression related to his innermost feelings had its
usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob
the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard and again
pressing the old mans hand went with him into the castle
when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his
dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made
at krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of his intentions for a
future campaign abroad kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark the same
submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the
emperors commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled
when kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by someones
kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
count tolstoy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
a small object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of
suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
across his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took the
object that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of the
next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor
honored by his presence kutuzov had received the order of st george of
the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but
everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprieties
were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but
everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good for
nothing when kutuzov conforming to a custom of catherines day
ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
emperors feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry face
and muttered something in which some people caught the words the old
the emperors displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna
by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the
when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled
about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they
all understood that the war was not ended
kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that
no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia
but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had
gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying
fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of
this being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regarded
as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war
to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method was
to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the
beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the
emperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander in
chiefs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the
with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
strength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovnitsyn and
ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field
his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
another and in fact his health was poor
so naturally simply and gradually just as he had come from turkey to
the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the army
when he was needed there now when his part was played out kutuzovs
place was taken by a new and necessary performer
the war of 1812 besides its national significance dear to every russian
heart was now to assume another a european significance
the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another
leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from
alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been
kutuzov did not understand what europe the balance of power or
napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of
the russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had
been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothing
left to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of the
national war but to die and kutuzov died
as generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the
physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after
they were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the third
day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up for
three months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever but
despite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave him
scarcely any impression was left on pierres mind by all that happened
to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered only
the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physical
distress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a general
impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being
worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he
also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and
above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time
on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov that same
day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of
borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs house
at yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned helenes
death supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this at
the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its
significance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as
possible from places where people were killing one another to some
peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all
the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he
immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw
in attendance on him two of his servants terenty and vaska who had
come from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been
living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had
it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the
impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and
got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
tomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he
would be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time in
his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the
same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
told after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of
his wife and the destruction of the french
a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural
to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow
filled pierres soul during his convalescence he was surprised to find
that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions
now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was
alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything
of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his
wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there
oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid
table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for
the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had
gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid
and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then
what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer
the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had
continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him
now that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
present itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him the
complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
he could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind of
rule or words or ideas but faith in an ever living ever manifest
god formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for
an aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivity
he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
nurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in his
captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infinite
and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the
freemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into
the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life he
had looked over the heads of the men around him when he should have
merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes
in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
infinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had only
what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped
himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where
petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him
great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had
seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accounted
them his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen
the same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he had
learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and
therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he naturally threw
away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens heads
and gladly regarded the ever changing eternally great unfathomable
and infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil
and happy he became that dreadful question what for which had
formerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for him
to that question what for a simple answer was now always ready in
his soul because there is a god that god without whose will not one
in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he was
just what he used to be as before he was absent minded and seemed
occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of
his own the difference between his former and present self was that
formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him
he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
distinguish something at a distance at present he still forgot what was
said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he now
looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
was before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeing
and hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be a
kindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoid
him now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips and
sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
whether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by his
previously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked and
seldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew
how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
the princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularly
hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
the old counts death now after staying a short time in orel where she
had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
considered it her duty to nurse him felt to her surprise and vexation
that she had become fond of him pierre did not in any way seek her
approval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had felt
that he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into
herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
of her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
intimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards
gratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her character
the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
showing sympathy with them yet pierres cunning consisted simply in
finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered
hard and in her own way proud princess
yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence of
bad people but of people such as myself thought she
his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the change
that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much
simpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him good
night often lingered with his masters boots in his hands and clothes
over his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre
noticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him there
well tell me now how did you get food he would ask
and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of the
old count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
talking or sometimes listening to pierres stories and then would go
out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though he
considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierre
telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
characters of his patients in general and especially of the ladies
its a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our
there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the
doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre
this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of
the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk
with him tell him about his past his life at home and his love and
pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially
if all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight
such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the
french do not even feel animosity toward them
pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by
evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing
during the last days of pierres stay in orel his old masonic
acquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in
1807 came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress who
had a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary post in
hearing that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had never been
intimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy
that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another
willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own
circle and as he supposed of similar interests
but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much
behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into
you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said
but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been
formerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre as
he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that
he had been like that himself but a short time before
willarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairs
his wifes affairs and his official duties he regarded all these
occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all
contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
continually absorbed his attention and pierre without trying to change
the others views and without condemning him but with the quiet
joyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in this
there was a new feature in pierres relations with willarski with the
princess with the doctor and with all the people he now met which
gained for him the general good will this was his acknowledgment of the
impossibility of changing a mans convictions by words and his
recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeing
things each from his own point of view this legitimate peculiarity of
each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a
basis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in other
people the difference and sometimes complete contradiction between
mens opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleased
him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile
