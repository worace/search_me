is that you clement he asked where the devil but noticing
his mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as a
stranger asking what he could do for him
dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
anything of the 6th regiment none of them knew anything and petya
thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with
hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent
if you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late said
a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh
dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that
he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
neck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again asked
to what regiment he belonged dolokhov as if he had not heard the
question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took
from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
those brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the
dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
such as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare to
attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied
well now hell come away petya thought every moment as he stood by
but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began
putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion
how many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the russian
a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one it would be
better to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strange
that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise
and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire
no one replied a word to dolokhovs laughter and a french officer whom
they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whispered
something to a companion dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who
will they bring our horses or not thought petya instinctively
petya wished to say good night but could not utter a word the
officers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting his
horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at a
footpace petya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether or
not the french were running after them but not daring to
coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the open
country but through the village at one spot he stopped and listened
do you hear he asked petya recognized the sound of russian voices
and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires
when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the
sentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it then
they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them
well now good by tell denisov at the first shot at daybreak said
dolokhov and was about to ride away but petya seized hold of him
really he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how splendid
all right all right said dolokhov but petya did not let go of him
and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him and
wanted to kiss him dolokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse and
having returned to the watchmans hut petya found denisov in the
passage he was awaiting petyas return in a state of agitation
anxiety and self reproach for having let him go
thank god he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated listening to
petyas rapturous account but devil take you i havent slept because
of you well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap before
but no said petya i dont want to sleep yet besides i know
myself if i fall asleep its finished and then i am used to not
he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day
then noticing that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of doors
it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were still
falling from the trees near the watchmans hut the black shapes of the
cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen behind
the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
were discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red not
all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid the
sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could be
heard low voices which seemed to be whispering
petya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagons
someone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses
munching their oats in the dark petya recognized his own horse which
he called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to it
well karabakh well do some service tomorrow said he sniffing its
why arent you asleep sir said a cossack who was sitting under a
no ah likhachev isnt that your name do you know i have only just
come back weve been into the french camp
and petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
also of his object and why he considered it better to risk his life
well you should get some sleep now said the cossack
no i am used to this said petya i say arent the flints in your
pistols worn out i brought some with me dont you want any you can
the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said petya
some fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and then
theyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like that
oh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my
saber for me its got bl petya feared to tell a lie and the saber
never had been sharpened can you do it
likhachev got up rummaged in his pack and soon petya heard the warlike
sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon
i say are the lads asleep asked petya
vesenny oh hes thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep
after that petya remained silent for a long time listening to the
sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared
what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon
thats right said the man whom petya took to be an hussar was the
it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away
petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisovs
guerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagon
captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under
it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark
blotch to the right was the watchmans hut and the red blotch below to
the left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come
for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor
waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where
nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be the
watchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the
earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of an
enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it might
very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high
tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or a
whole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was
just the cossack likhachev who was sitting under the wagon but it
might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in the
world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar
came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply
nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in a
he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth
it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly
sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the clouds
were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if
the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
petyas eyes began to close and he swayed a little
the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and
ozheg zheg ozheg zheg hissed the saber against the whetstone and
suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown
sweetly solemn hymn petya was as musical as natasha and more so than
nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the
melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
fresh and attractive the music became more and more audible the melody
grew and passed from one instrument to another and what was played was
a fugue though petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is
each instrument now resembling a violin and now a horn but better and
clearer than violin or horn played its own part and before it had
finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
same air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended into
one and again became separate and again blended now into solemn church
music now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant
oh why that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurched
forward its in my ears but perhaps its music of my own well go
he closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance sounds
fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again all
mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful as
much as i like and as i like said petya to himself he tried to
now softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him now fuller
more joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth rose
increasingly triumphant sounds now voices join in ordered petya and
at first from afar he heard mens voices and then womens the voices
grew in harmonious triumphant strength and petya listened to their
with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from the
trees and the hissing of the saber ozheg zheg zheg and again the
horses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir but
petya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the
time wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to
share it he was awakened by likhachevs kindly voice
its ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it
its getting light its really getting light he exclaimed
the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their
very tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches
petya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave it
to likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it
the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle
denisov came out of the watchmans hut and having called petya gave
the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened
their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the
watchmans hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment
passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
of early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul
gave some orders to his men petya held his horse by the bridle
impatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed in
cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliant
cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically
well is evwything weady asked denisov bwing the horses
the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the
saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted petya put his
foot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but
petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and
turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode
vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for gods
denisov seemed to have forgotten petyas very existence he turned to
i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove
he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way
when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing
light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the
cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden by
denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their
haunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into the
ravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantly
increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid
distant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back and
the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the tramp
of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sides
at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting petya lashed his
horse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denisov who
shouted at him it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was fired
it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge
cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the bridge he
collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on in
front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right to
left across the road one of them fell in the mud under his horses
cossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midst
of that crowd terrible screams arose petya galloped up and the first
thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman
clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him
hurrah lads ours shouted petya and giving rein to his
excited horse he galloped forward along the village street
he could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged
russian prisoners who had come running from both sides of the road
were shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallant looking
frenchman in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red face
had been defending himself against the hussars when petya galloped up
the frenchman had already fallen too late again flashed through
petyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
could be heard the shots came from the yard of the landowners house he
had visited the night before with dolokhov the french were making a
stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway
through the smoke as he approached the gate petya saw dolokhov whose
face was of a pale greenish tint shouting to his men go round wait
for the infantry he exclaimed as petya rode up to him
wait hurrah ah ah shouted petya and without pausing a moment
galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
a volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed
against something the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya into
the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of the
french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the
cossacks while others ran down the hill toward the pond petya was
galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he waved
both his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and farther
to one side in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfire
that was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and petya
fell heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms and
legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet had
after speaking to the senior french officer who came out of the house
with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they
surrendered dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya who lay
done for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet denisov
killed cried denisov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably
lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which petyas body was
done for repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words
afforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were
surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up we wont take them he
denisov did not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and with
trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained mud bespattered
i am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all he
recalled petyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the
sound like the yelp of a dog with which denisov turned away walked to
the wattle fence and seized hold of it
among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierre
during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been
issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among
whom was pierre on the twenty second of october that party was no
longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone
on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in
front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillery
the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now
replaced by marshal junots enormous baggage train convoyed by
westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train
from vyazma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three
columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre
had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now
the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
continually changed about now joining the moving column now again
several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run
headlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled and
these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores the convoy of
prisoners and junots baggage train still constituted a separate and
united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away
of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been
captured or left behind some of junots wagons also had been captured
or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from
davouts corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a
larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the
prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been
shot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon belonging to the
the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundred
and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now
remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the
cavalry saddles or junots baggage they understood that the saddles and
junots spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers
should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who
froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to
shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the
escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in
of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness
at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking the
prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores several
of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were
the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners
should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned
all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had
rejoined karataev and the gray blue bandy legged dog that had chosen
on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the
fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grew
gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but
since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go
near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
karataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelled
the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre
moved farther away and did not think about him
while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect
but with his whole being by life itself that man is created for
happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simple
human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from
superfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he had
learned still another new consolatory truth that nothing in this world
is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which man
can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he
need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom
have their limits and that those limits are very near together that the
person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as
he now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled
while the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing
shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to
pieces he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free
will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when
they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself
subsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcely
felt the worst was the state of his bare raw and scab covered feet
the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of
the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no
great cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night
there were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body
the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet
after the second days march pierre having examined his feet by the
campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when
everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up
walked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more
terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them now
only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to
another which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit
he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
behind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did not
think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the
harder his position became and the more terrible the future the more
independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful
and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him
at midday on the twenty second of october pierre was going uphill along
the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of
the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar
and his own the blue gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and self satisfaction
lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on
all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the
dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay
the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of
decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the
it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining
harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water
pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in
threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the
rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder
it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep
within him his soul was occupied with something important and
comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
at their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire
pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better
there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his
greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his
effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it
was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free of
his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and
heard platons voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face
brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his
feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away
but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at
how am i if we grumble at sickness god wont grant us death replied
platon and at once resumed the story he had begun
and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face
and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother
pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to
him alone some half dozen times and always with a specially joyful
emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to
something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told
it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant
who lived a good and god fearing life with his family and who went once
to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant
having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his
companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife
was found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knouted and
his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put it
he was sent to hard labor in siberia
and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years
or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he
should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one
night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among
them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they
had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had
taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply
been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what
are you being punished for daddy i my dear brothers said he am
being punished for my own and other mens sins but i have not killed
anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my
poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much
property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i
dont grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me
only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began
to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when
and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache
so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet
you are perishing because of me daddy he says its quite true
lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for
nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your
head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for christs
karataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew
and the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in his
sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and
what do you think dear friends karataev continued his face
brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story
what do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the
authorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sinner
but what i am most sorry for is this old man dont let him suffer
because of me so he confessed and it was all written down and the
papers sent off in due form the place was a long way off and while
they were judging what with one thing and another filling in the
papers all in due form the authorities i mean time passed the affair
reached the tsar after a while the tsars decree came to set the
merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded the
paper arrived and they began to look for the old man where is the old
man who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come from
the tsar so they began looking for him here karataevs lower jaw
trembled but god had already forgiven him he was dead thats how it
was dear fellows karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent
and pierres soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
but by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit up
karataevs face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy
a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful
and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
prisoners from all sides came shouts of command and from the left came
smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at a
trot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the
approach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and were
pushed off the road the convoy formed up
the emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had the
sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled
by pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three cornered hat with a
tranquil look on his handsome plump white face it was one of the
marshals his eye fell on pierres large and striking figure and in the
expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he
detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy
the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
red and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse several officers
formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all
what did he say what did he say pierre heard them ask
while the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in a
crowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning he
sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his face
besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling
the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now an
karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
tears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if he
did not notice that look and moved hastily away
when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev was
still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
frenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look round again
from behind where karataev had been sitting came the sound of a shot
pierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he had
not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
smolensk a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he
again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one of
whom carried a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and in
the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at pierre
there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young
soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and remembered
that two days before that man had burned his shirt while drying it at
the fire and how they had laughed at him
behind him where karataev had been sitting the dog began to howl
what a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierre
his comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided looking
back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling
just as pierre did but there was a set look on all their faces
the stores the prisoners and the marshals baggage train stopped at
the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires
pierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his
back to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had
done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino
again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or another
gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had
life is everything life is god everything changes and moves and that
movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness
of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than
all else is to love this life in ones sufferings in innocent
and suddenly he saw vividly before him a long forgotten kindly old man
who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit said
the old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was alive a
vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of
drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed
places sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one
dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much
space as possible but others striving to do the same compressed it
sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it
how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know
god is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him
to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the
surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev has
spread out and disappeared do you understand my child said the
do you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke up
he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian
soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of
meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy
hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his
brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of
its all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldier
and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away
and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier the
frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something
with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the blue gray dog
ah hes come said pierre and plat  he began but did not finish
suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy of
the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree of the shot
heard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty faces of the two
frenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and of
karataevs absence at this halt and he was on the point of realizing
that karataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew not
why the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev and
without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from
them pierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country in
summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibrating
globe and he sank into water so that it closed over his head
before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing
the cossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd of
for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him all
around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy
brothers dear fellows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping as
the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered them
clothes another boots and a third bread pierre sobbed as he sat among
them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier who
dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd of
disarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that had
happened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passed
dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them
with cold glassy eyes that boded no good they became silent on the
opposite side stood dolokhovs cossack counting the prisoners and
marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate
filez filez  dolokhov kept saying having adopted this expression
from the french and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
denisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossacks
who were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dug
after the twenty eighth of october when the frosts began the flight of
the french assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing or
roasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages with
people dressed in furs continued to drive past carrying away the
property that had been stolen by the emperor kings and dukes but the
process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on
from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventy three thousand men not
reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillage
was reduced to thirty six thousand though not more than five thousand
had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding terms of the
progression could be determined mathematically the french army melted
away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma from vyazma to
smolensk from smolensk to the berezina and from the berezina to vilna
independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold the
pursuit the barring of the way or any other particular conditions
beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled
together into one mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to his
emperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge
from the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is what
i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various
corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
two or three days march they are almost disbanded scarcely a quarter
of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the others
go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
escape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place where
they hope to recover during the last few days many of the men have been
seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms in such a state of
affairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of your
majestys service demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk
and should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismounted
cavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longer
in proportion to the present forces the soldiers who are worn out with
hunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as a few days rest
many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs this
state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that
unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under
after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land the
french searching for food killed one another sacked their own stores
and when everything had been plundered fled farther
they all went without knowing whither or why they were going still less
did that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any orders to him
but still he and those about him retained their old habits wrote
commands letters reports and orders of the day called one another
sire mon cousin prince deckmuhl roi de naples and so on but these
orders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted upon
for they could not be carried out and though they entitled one another
majesties highnesses or cousins they all felt that they were
miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay
and though they pretended to be concerned about the army each was
thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from
moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian
blindmans bluff in which two players are blindfolded and one of them
occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
whereabouts first he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into a
tight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking to
at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road napoleons
armies made their presence known but later when they reached the
smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight and
often thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians
owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and
the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of
approximately ascertaining the enemys position by cavalry scouting
was not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change
of position by each army even what information was obtained could not
be delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy had
been in a certain position the day before by the third day when
something could have been done that army was already two days march
one army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were several
different roads available for the french and one would have thought
that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the
enemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
undertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob with no
maneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neither
to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road through
expecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separated
in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty four hours in
front of them all fled the emperor then the kings then the dukes the
russian army expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
the dnieper which was the only reasonable thing for him to do
themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at
krasnoe and here as in a game of blindmans buff the french ran into
our vanguard seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into
confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright but then they
resumed their flight abandoning their comrades who were farther behind
then for three days separate portions of the french army first murats
the vice kings then davouts and then neys ran as it were the
gauntlet of the russian army they abandoned one another abandoned all
their heavy baggage their artillery and half their men and fled
getting past the russians by night by making semicircles to the right
ney who came last had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
smolensk which were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunate
plight of the french or because of it they wished to punish the floor
against which they had hurt themselves ney who had had a corps of ten
thousand men reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men left
having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon and having crossed the
dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot
from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna still playing at
blindmans buff with the pursuing army at the berezina they again
became disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but those
who got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a fur
coat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on alone
abandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away too
leaving those who could not to surrender or die
this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did
all they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto the
kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army none of the
movements of the crowd had any sense so one might have thought that
regarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed the
actions of the mass to the will of one man would have found it
impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory but no
mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
campaign and everywhere are described napoleons arrangements the
maneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as the
the retreat from malo yaroslavets when he had a free road into a well
supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which
kutuzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a
devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound
considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his
retreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is
described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
and take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stick
