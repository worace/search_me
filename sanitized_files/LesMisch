on the day of the sixth of june a battue of the sewers had been
ordered it was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for
refuge and prefect gisquet was to search occult paris while general
bugeaud swept public paris a double and connected operation which
exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force represented
above by the army and below by the police three squads of agents and
sewermen explored the subterranean drain of paris the first on the
right bank the second on the left bank the third in the city the
agents of police were armed with carabines with bludgeons swords and
that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern
this patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind
alleys which lie beneath the rue du cadran while they were passing
their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys jean valjean had
encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery had perceived
that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated
thither he had passed on the police on emerging from the gallery
du cadran had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the
direction of the belt sewer they were in fact the steps of jean
valjean the sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern
and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence
this was an indescribable moment for jean valjean
happily if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill it
was light and he was shadow he was very far off and mingled with the
darkness of the place he hugged the wall and halted moreover he did
not understand what it was that was moving behind him the lack of sleep
and food and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of
a visionary he beheld a gleam and around that gleam forms what was
the men of the patrol listened and heard nothing they looked and saw
there existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer a sort
of cross roads called de service which was afterwards suppressed on
account of the little interior lake which formed there swallowing up
the torrent of rain in heavy storms the patrol could form a cluster in
this open space jean valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle
these bull dogs heads approached each other closely and whispered
the result of this council held by the watch dogs was that they had
been mistaken that there had been no noise that it was useless to get
entangled in the belt sewer that it would only be a waste of time
but that they ought to hasten towards saint merry that if there
was anything to do and any bousingot to track out it was in that
from time to time parties re sole their old insults in 1832 the word
bousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin which had become
obsolete and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent
the sergeant gave orders to turn to the left towards the watershed of
if it had occurred to them to separate into two squads and to go in
both directions jean valjean would have been captured all hung on
that thread it is probable that the instructions of the prefecture
foreseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force had
forbidden the patrol to part company the patrol resumed its march
leaving jean valjean behind it of all this movement jean valjean
perceived nothing except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly
before taking his departure the sergeant in order to acquit his
policemans conscience discharged his gun in the direction of jean
valjean the detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt like the
rumbling of that titanic entrail a bit of plaster which fell into the
stream and splashed up the water a few paces away from jean valjean
warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head
slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work
gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance the group
of black forms vanished a glimmer of light oscillated and floated
communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter then
disappeared the silence became profound once more the obscurity became
complete blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows
and jean valjean not daring to stir as yet remained for a long time
leaning with his back against the wall with straining ears and dilated
pupils watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol
this justice must be rendered to the police of that period that even in
the most serious public junctures it imperturbably fulfilled its duties
connected with the sewers and surveillance a revolt was in its eyes
no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths
and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in
peril the ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the
extraordinary service and was not troubled by the latter in the midst
of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of
a possible revolution a police agent spun a thief without allowing
himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades
it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon
of the 6th of june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right
shore a little beyond the pont des invalides
there is no longer any bank there now the aspect of the locality has
on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be
watching each other while mutually avoiding each other the one who was
in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to
it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence
neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though
each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his
one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and
purposely without wearing the air of doing so the prey was crafty and
the proper relations between the hunted pole cat and the hunting dog
were observed the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant
mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize
him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter
the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second
but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious any one who
could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre
hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains
the shore was deserted there were no passers by not even a boatman nor
a lighter man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there
it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and
to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was
in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal
being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the
other like a classic and official personage wearing the frock coat of
perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see
what was the object of the second man
probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly
when a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags it is in order
to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state only the whole
question lies in the color to be dressed in blue is glorious to be
it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which
if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it
was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to
some significant meeting place and to some group worth catching this
what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned up
man on catching sight from the shore of a hackney coach on the quay
as it was passing along empty made a sign to the driver the driver
understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal
turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay
at a foot pace this was not observed by the slouching and tattered
the hackney coach rolled along the trees of the champs elysees the
bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the
one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents
contains this article always have on hand a hackney coach in case of
while these two men were manoeuvring each on his own side with
irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay
which descended to the shore and which permitted cab drivers arriving
from passy to come to the river and water their horses this inclined
plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die
it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend
this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the
champs elysees a place ornamented with trees but in return much
infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise
this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to
paris from moret in 1824 by colonel brack and designated as the house
of francois i a guard house is situated close at hand
to the great surprise of his watcher the man who was being tracked did
not mount by the inclined plane for watering he continued to advance
what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine
henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was
no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot
marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the
bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and
was lost in the water there he would inevitably find himself blocked
between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and
in front of him and the authorities on his heels
it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a
heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition
or other but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind
that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt the expedient would
have been puerile he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing the
innocence of thieves does not extend to that point
the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the waters edge
which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay
the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went
round it so that he ceased to be seen by the other
the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of
this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly in a
few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it there
he halted in sheer amazement the man whom he had been pursuing was no
total eclipse of the man in the blouse
the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty paces
long then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the
quay the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without
being seen by the man who was following him what had become of him
the man in the buttoned up coat walked to the extremity of the shore
and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes
searching all at once he smote his brow he had just perceived at the
point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron
grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive
hinges this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay
opened on the river as well as on the shore a blackish stream passed
under it this stream discharged into the seine
beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor
could be descried the man folded his arms and stared at the grating
as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook
it it resisted solidly it is probable that it had just been opened
although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in so rusty a
grating but it is certain that it had been closed again this indicated
that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a
this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to
move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation
then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world
of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost
that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should
see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch
behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer
the hackney coach which regulated all its movements on his had in its
turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet the coachman
foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses muzzles in the bag of
oats which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisians
to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applies it
the rare passers by on the pont de jena turned their heads before they
pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless
items in the landscape the man on the shore the carriage on the quay
jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused
this march became more and more laborious the level of these vaults
varies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been
calculated for the stature of a man jean valjean was forced to bend
over in order not to strike marius against the vault at every step
he had to bend then to rise and to feel incessantly of the wall the
moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber framework
furnished but poor supports to which to cling either for hand or foot
he stumbled along in the hideous dung heap of the city the intermittent
gleams from the air holes only appeared at very long intervals and were
so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all
the rest was mist miasma opaqueness blackness jean valjean was both
hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a
place full of water where a man cannot drink his strength which was
prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased
by age thanks to his chaste and sober life began to give way
nevertheless fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength
decreased it made the weight of his burden increase marius who was
perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh jean valjean
held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that
respiration could proceed as well as possible between his legs he felt
the rapid gliding of the rats one of them was frightened to such a
degree that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reached
him through the vent holes of the mouths of the sewer and re animated
it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the
he was at first astonished at this sudden widening he found himself
all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach
the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the
grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high
at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other
subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the
abattoir form a square between these four ways a less sagacious man
would have remained undecided jean valjean selected the broadest that
is to say the belt sewer but here the question again came up should
he descend or ascend he thought that the situation required haste and
that he must now gain the seine at any risk in other terms he must
it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the
belt sewer has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other
towards passy and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean
girdle of the paris on the right bank the grand sewer which is it
must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of menilmontant
terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its
ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the
knoll of menilmontant there is no direct communication with the
branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier
popincourt and which falls into the seine through the amelot sewer
above the ancient isle louviers this branch which completes the
collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue menilmontant
itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between
upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he
would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with
fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall he would
in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering
the passage of the filles du calvaire on condition that he did not
hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucherat and by
taking the corridor saint louis then the saint gilles gut on the left
then turning to the right and avoiding the saint sebastian gallery he
might have reached the amelot sewer and thence provided that he did
not go astray in the sort of f which lies under the bastille he might
have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal but in order
to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous
madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings
now we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain
which he was traversing and had any one asked him in what he was he
his instinct served him well to descend was in fact possible safety
he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the
form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue saint georges and the
a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch
he halted he was extremely weary a passably large air hole probably
the man hole in the rue danjou furnished a light that was almost
vivid jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother
would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the
banquette of the sewer marius blood stained face appeared under the
wan light of the air hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb his
eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a
painters brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead a
clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat his limbs were
cold and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had
thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the
yawning gashes in the living flesh jean valjean pushing aside the
garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius
breast his heart was still beating jean valjean tore up his shirt
bandaged the young mans wounds as well as he was able and stopped the
flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious
and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with
on disarranging marius garments he had found two things in his
pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding
evening and marius pocketbook he ate the roll and opened the
pocketbook on the first page he found the four lines written by marius
my name is marius pontmercy carry my body to my grandfather m
gillenormand rue des filles du calvaire no 6 in the marais
jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the air hole and
remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought repeating in a low
tone rue des filles du calvaire number 6 monsieur gillenormand he
replaced the pocketbook in marius pocket he had eaten his strength
had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed
the latters head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his
the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of
menilmontant is about two leagues long it is paved throughout a
this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are
illuminating for the reader jean valjeans subterranean march jean
valjean himself did not possess nothing told him what zone of the city
he was traversing nor what way he had made only the growing pallor of
the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to
him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day
would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become
intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he
concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he
was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer
boulevards or the extreme outer quays where there are fewer houses and
streets the sewer has fewer air holes the gloom deepened around jean
valjean nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the
chapter v in the case of sand as in that of woman there is a fineness
he felt that he was entering the water and that he no longer had a
it sometimes happens that on certain shores of bretagne or scotland a
man either a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the
beach far from shore suddenly notices that for several minutes past
he has been walking with some difficulty the beach under foot is
like pitch his soles stick fast to it it is no longer sand it is
bird lime the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes
as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water the
eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and
tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the
soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little
cloud of sand lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the
the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land endeavors
to approach the shore he is not uneasy uneasy about what only he is
conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every
step that he takes all at once he sinks in he sinks in two or three
inches decidedly he is not on the right road he halts to get his
bearings suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared
the sand has covered them he draws his feet out of the sand he tries
to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than
before the sand is up to his ankles he tears himself free from it
and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to mid leg he flings
himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees then with
indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a
quicksand and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which
neither man can walk nor fish can swim he flings away his burden if he
have one he lightens himself like a ship in distress it is too late
he shouts he waves his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually
gains on him if the beach is deserted if the land is too far away if
the bank of sand is too ill famed there is no hero in the neighborhood
all is over he is condemned to be engulfed he is condemned to that
terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible
to either retard or hasten which lasts for hours which will not come
to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which
drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at
every shout that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air
of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp which forces
a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the
horizon the trees the verdant country the smoke of the villages on
the plain the sails of the ships on the sea the birds which fly
and sing the sun and the sky this engulfment is the sepulchre which
assumes a tide and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards
a living man each minute is an inexorable layer out of the dead the
wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement
that he makes buries him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he
feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implores cries to the
clouds wrings his hands grows desperate behold him in the sand up
to his belly the sand reaches to his breast he is only a bust now
he uplifts his hands utters furious groans clenches his nails on the
beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows
in order to raise himself from that soft sheath and sobs frantically
the sand mounts higher the sand has reached his shoulders the sand
reaches to his throat only his face is visible now his mouth cries
aloud the sand fills it silence his eyes still gaze forth the sand
closes them night then his brow decreases a little hair quivers above
the sand a hand projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and
sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is
swallowed up with his cart all founders in that strand it is shipwreck
elsewhere than in the water it is the earth drowning a man the earth
permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall it presents itself in the
guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave the abyss is subject to
this melancholy fate always possible on certain sea beaches was also
possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris
before the important works undertaken in 1833 the subterranean drain
of paris was subject to these sudden slides
the water filtered into certain subjacent strata which were
particularly friable the foot way which was of flag stones as in
the ancient sewers or of cement on concrete as in the new galleries
having no longer an underpinning gave way a fold in a flooring of this
sort means a crack means crumbling the framework crumbled away for a
certain length this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of mire was called a
fontis in the special tongue what is a fontis it is the quicksands of
the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is
the beach of mont saint michel in a sewer the soaked soil is in a
state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft
medium it is not earth and it is not water the depth is sometimes very
great nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter if the
water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up if earth
can any one picture to himself such a death if being swallowed by the
earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a cess pool instead of
the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds
those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried
in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable
passers by of succor possible up to the very last moment instead
of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb
already prepared death in the mire beneath a cover slow suffocation
by filth a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and
clutches you by the throat fetidness mingled with the death rattle
slime instead of the strand sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the
hurricane dung in place of the ocean and to shout to gnash ones
teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that
enormous city which knows nothing of it all over ones head
inexpressible is the horror of dying thus death sometimes redeems
his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity on the funeral pile in
shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb
attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes
but not here death is filthy it is humiliating to expire the supreme
floating visions are abject mud is synonymous with shame it is
petty ugly infamous to die in a butt of malvoisie like clarence is
permissible in the ditch of a scavenger like escoubleau is horrible
to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going
through the death agony one is floundering about there are shadows
enough for hell and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough and
the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre
everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister here it is deformed
the depth of the fontis varied as well as their length and their
density according to the more or less bad quality of the sub soil
sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep sometimes eight or ten
sometimes the bottom was unfathomable here the mire was almost solid
there almost liquid in the luniere fontis it would have taken a man a
day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by
the philippeaux slough the mire bears up more or less according to its
density a child can escape where a man will perish the first law of
safety is to get rid of every sort of load every sewerman who felt the
ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools
the fontis were due to different causes the friability of the soil
some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer
rains the incessant flooding of winter long drizzling showers
sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil
forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to
bend aside or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under
this crushing thrust in this manner the heaping up of the parthenon
obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of saint genevieve
hill when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the
mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space
like the teeth of a saw between the paving stones this crevice was
developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the
cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be
promptly applied it also frequently happened that the interior ravages
were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the
sewermen when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were
liable to be lost ancient registers make mention of several scavengers
who were buried in fontis in this manner they give many names among
others that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under
the man hole of the rue careme prenant a certain blaise poutrain this
blaise poutrain was the brother of nicholas poutrain who was the last
grave digger of the cemetery called the charnier des innocents in 1785
there was also that young and charming vicomte descoubleau of whom we
have just spoken one of the heroes of the siege of lerida where they
delivered the assault in silk stockings with violins at their head
descoubleau surprised one night at his cousins the duchess de
sourdis was drowned in a quagmire of the beautreillis sewer in which
he had taken refuge in order to escape from the duke madame de sourdis
when informed of his death demanded her smelling bottle and forgot to
weep through sniffling at her salts in such cases there is no love
which holds fast the sewer extinguishes it hero refuses to wash the
body of leander thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and
jean valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis
this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the
champs elysees difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad
preservative of the subterranean constructions on account of its
excessive fluidity this fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the
sands of the quartier saint georges which could only be conquered by
a stone construction on a concrete foundation and the clayey strata
infected with gas of the quartier des martyrs which are so liquid
that the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des
martyrs was by means of a cast iron pipe when in 1836 the old stone
sewer beneath the faubourg saint honore in which we now see jean
valjean was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it the
quicksand which forms the subsoil of the champs elysees as far as the
seine presented such an obstacle that the operation lasted nearly
six months to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside
particularly those who had hotels and carriages the work was more than
unhealthy it was dangerous it is true that they had four months and a
half of rain and three floods of the seine
the fontis which jean valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour
of the preceding day the pavement badly sustained by the subjacent
sand had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water
infiltration had taken place a slip had followed the dislocated bottom
had sunk into the ooze to what extent impossible to say the obscurity
was more dense there than elsewhere it was a pit of mire in a cavern of
jean valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet he entered
this slime there was water on the surface slime at the bottom he must
pass it to retrace his steps was impossible marius was dying and jean
valjean exhausted besides where was he to go jean valjean advanced
moreover the pit seemed for the first few steps not to be very deep
but in proportion as he advanced his feet plunged deeper soon he had
the slime up to his calves and water above his knees he walked on
raising marius in his arms as far above the water as he could the mire
now reached to his knees and the water to his waist he could no longer
retreat this mud dense enough for one man could not obviously
uphold two marius and jean valjean would have stood a chance of
extricating themselves singly jean valjean continued to advance
supporting the dying man who was perhaps a corpse
the water came up to his arm pits he felt that he was sinking it was
only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which
he had now reached the density which was his support was also
an obstacle he still held marius on high and with an unheard of
expenditure of force he advanced still but he was sinking he had only
his head above the water now and his two arms holding up marius in the
old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus
he sank still deeper he turned his face to the rear to escape the
water and in order that he might be able to breathe anyone who had
seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a
mask floating on the shadows he caught a faint glimpse above him of the
drooping head and livid face of marius he made a desperate effort and
launched his foot forward his foot struck something solid a point of
he straightened himself up and rooted himself upon that point of
support with a sort of fury this produced upon him the effect of the
first step in a staircase leading back to life
the point of support thus encountered in the mire at the supreme
moment was the beginning of the other water shed of the pavement which
had bent but had not given way and which had curved under the water
like a plank and in a single piece well built pavements form a vault
and possess this sort of firmness this fragment of the vaulting partly
submerged but solid was a veritable inclined plane and once on this
plane he was safe jean valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached
as he emerged from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell
upon his knees he reflected that this was but just and he remained
there for some time with his soul absorbed in words addressed to god
he rose to his feet shivering chilled foul smelling bowed beneath
the dying man whom he was dragging after him all dripping with slime
and his soul filled with a strange light
chapter vii one sometimes runs aground when one fancies that one is
he set out on his way once more
however although he had not left his life in the fontis he seemed
to have left his strength behind him there that supreme effort had
exhausted him his lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause
for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall once
he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter marius
position and he thought that he should have to remain there but if his
vigor was dead his energy was not he rose again
he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred
paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with
the wall he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the
turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he raised his eyes
and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him
he perceived a light this time it was not that terrible light it was
good white light it was daylight jean valjean saw the outlet
a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly
perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt
it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that
radiant portal jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue he no
longer felt marius weight he found his legs once more of steel he ran
rather than walked as he approached the outlet became more and more
distinctly defined it was a pointed arch lower than the vault which
gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as
the vault grew lower the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel
a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries
logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been
it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out
the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all
appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone
jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous
brick the keyhole could be seen and the robust latch deeply sunk in
the iron staple the door was plainly double locked it was one of those
prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing
beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore
very narrow but sufficient for escape the distant quays paris that
gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty
on the right down stream the bridge of jena was discernible on the
left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a
propitious one in which to await the night and to escape it was one
of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the
grand caillou flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the
it might have been half past eight oclock in the evening the day was
jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the
vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the
bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move the
grating did not stir jean valjean seized the bars one after the other
in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to
make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock not
a bar stirred the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their
sockets no lever no prying possible the obstacle was invincible
there was no means of opening the gate
must he then stop there what was he to do what was to become of him
he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey
which he had already taken besides how was he to again traverse that
quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle and
after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly
could not be twice avoided and then whither was he to go what
direction should he pursue to follow the incline would not conduct
him to his goal if he were to reach another outlet he would find it
obstructed by a plug or a grating every outlet was undoubtedly closed
in that manner chance had unsealed the grating through which he had
entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred
he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison
all was over everything that jean valjean had done was useless
they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean
valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and
quivering in the shadows he turned his back to the grating and fell
upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius
who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees
of what was he thinking during this profound depression neither of
himself nor of marius he was thinking of cosette
in the midst of this prostration a hand was laid on his shoulder and a
some person in that gloom nothing so closely resembles a dream as
despair jean valjean thought that he was dreaming he had heard no
footsteps was it possible he raised his eyes
this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare he held his shoes
in his left hand he had evidently removed them in order to reach jean
valjean without allowing his steps to be heard
jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant unexpected as was this
encounter this man was known to him the man was thenardier
although awakened so to speak with a start jean valjean accustomed
to alarms and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly
parried instantly regained possession of his presence of mind
moreover the situation could not be made worse a certain degree of
distress is no longer capable of a crescendo and thenardier himself
could add nothing to this blackness of this night
thenardier raising his right hand to a level with his forehead formed
with it a shade then he brought his eyelashes together by screwing up
his eyes a motion which in connection with a slight contraction of the
mouth characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring
to recognize another man he did not succeed jean valjean as we have
just stated had his back turned to the light and he was moreover
so disfigured so bemired so bleeding that he would have been
unrecognizable in full noonday on the contrary illuminated by the
light from the grating a cellar light it is true livid yet precise
in its lividness thenardier as the energetic popular metaphor
expresses it immediately leaped into jean valjeans eyes this
inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to jean
valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning
between the two situations and the two men the encounter took place
jean valjean immediately perceived that thenardier did not recognize
they surveyed each other for a moment in that half gloom as though
taking each others measure thenardier was the first to break the
how are you going to manage to get out
its impossible to pick the lock of that gate but still you must get
you have killed that man thats all right i have the key
i dont know you but i want to help you you must be a friend
jean valjean began to comprehend thenardier took him for an assassin
listen comrade you didnt kill that man without looking to see what
he had in his pockets give me my half ill open the door for you
and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key he added
do you want to see how a key to liberty is made look here
jean valjean remained stupid the expression belongs to the elder
corneille to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was
real it was providence appearing in horrible guise and his good angel
springing from the earth in the form of thenardier
thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his
blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean
hold on said he ill give you the rope to boot
you will need a stone also but you can find one outside theres a
what am i to do with a stone
idiot youll want to sling that stiff into the river youll need a
stone and a rope otherwise it would float on the water
jean valjean took the rope there is no one who does not occasionally
thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred
ah see here comrade how did you contrive to get out of that slough
yonder i havent dared to risk myself in it phew you dont smell
im asking you questions but youre perfectly right not to answer
its an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the
examining magistrate and then when you dont talk at all you run no
risk of talking too loud thats no matter as i cant see your face and
as i dont know your name you are wrong in supposing that i dont know
who you are and what you want i twig youve broken up that gentleman
a bit now you want to tuck him away somewhere the river that great
hider of folly is what you want ill get you out of your scrape
helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair
while expressing his approval of jean valjeans silence he endeavored
to force him to talk he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a
sight of his profile and he exclaimed without however raising his
apropos of that quagmire youre a hearty animal why didnt you toss
thenardier resumed pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the
level of his adams apple a gesture which completes the capable air of
after all you acted wisely the workmen when they come to morrow to
stop up that hole would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there
and it might have been possible thread by thread straw by straw to
pick up the scent and reach you some one has passed through the sewer
who where did he get out was he seen to come out the police are full
of cleverness the sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you such a
find is a rarity it attracts attention very few people make use of
the sewers for their affairs while the river belongs to everybody the
river is the true grave at the end of a month they fish up your man
in the nets at saint cloud well what does one care for that its
carrion who killed that man paris and justice makes no inquiries you
the more loquacious thenardier became the more mute was jean valjean
now lets settle this business lets go shares you have seen my key
thenardier was haggard fierce suspicious rather menacing yet
there was one singular circumstance thenardiers manners were not
simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting
an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on
his mouth and muttered hush it was difficult to divine why there
was no one there except themselves jean valjean thought that other
ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook not very far off and
that thenardier did not care to share with them
lets settle up how much did the stiff have in his bags
it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some
money about him the mournful life of expedients to which he had been
condemned imposed this as a law upon him on this occasion however
he had been caught unprepared when donning his uniform of a national
guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten dolefully absorbed
as he was to take his pocket book he had only some small change in his
fob he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on
the banquette of the vault one louis dor two five franc pieces and
thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the
he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the
greatest familiarity jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping
his back to the light let him have his way
while handling marius coat thenardier with the skill of a pickpocket
and without being noticed by jean valjean tore off a strip which he
concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morsel of
stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the
assassin however he found no more than the thirty francs
thats true said he both of you together have no more than that
and forgetting his motto half shares he took all
he hesitated a little over the large sous after due reflection he took
