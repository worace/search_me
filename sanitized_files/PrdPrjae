after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham
were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was
well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet
mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so
many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to
her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came
from netherfield the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little
hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and
elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected
herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane
invited her to follow her up stairs when they had gained their own room
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good
deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on
their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly
and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a
house the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything
i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend
but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown
expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw
nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as
to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we
are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have
determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my
dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowd but of
that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should
why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own
master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth
we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think
georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the
country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters
partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most
capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest
jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she
finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is
perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to
put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject
yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it
you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she
is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the
case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion
that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble
in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and
i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead
of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your
representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the
foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you
will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature
deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by
how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be
required a thousand things may arise in six months
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines
interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after
lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good
humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was
very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards
herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very
soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins
from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to
conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost
secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday
his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer
mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes
of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes
dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had
gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were
in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible
nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must
be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was
the only provision for well educated young women of small fortune
and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest
preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at
the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all
the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder
and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be
shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved
to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins
when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was
at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality
said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly
gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and
you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my
good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so
you cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than her
displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home
and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no
means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very
agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before
the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and
engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained
why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort
for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised
very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry
you but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never
was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss
character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause
they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much
longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible
that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a
most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what
she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them
and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but
incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness
protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and
good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she
was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character
of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins
had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be
happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two
inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that
elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could
console and nothing could appease her nor did that day wear out her
resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for
it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty
and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a
clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was
though mrs bennets sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious
as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised
letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to
their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharging
his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many
rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine
he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and
they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its
frequently occurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for
as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more
painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject
was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her
impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used it needed
all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
mr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention
and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them
from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight
of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to
make way for her and live to see her take her place in it
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for
better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of
making any answer she went on as before
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own
daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too
why should he have it more than anybody else
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest
of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the
writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied
the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an
inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this
heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others to carolines
assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she
had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she
could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness
of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination had his own happiness however
been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as
she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short
on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she
could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really
died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether
he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his
observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but
i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have
no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear
and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a
little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself
my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say
to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the
world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want
to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not
be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people
whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the
other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will
ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and
charlottes steady prudent character remember that she is one of a
large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be
ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like
to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a
conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as
i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though
it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual
change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied
jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together but enough of this you alluded to something else you
mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat
you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and
saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design
said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others
unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness
want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution
and do you impute it to either of those
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can
only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his
happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great
beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love
her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very
objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try
to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an
affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most
unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken or at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what
i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in
the best light in the light in which it may be understood
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her
no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best
comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer
mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day
your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to
being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then
it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough in
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham
be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society
of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity
mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason
to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his
relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas
at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly
superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so
well bred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger
than mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant
woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the
two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard
they had frequently been staying with her in town
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was
done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they
had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr
bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not
been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room
and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed
sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of
them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted
so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before
in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her
sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am
sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such
as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets
her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not
do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so
doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half hours acquaintance
as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite
inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time
they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be
finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love
oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor
jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get
over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might be
of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of
town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go
out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his
friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such
a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may
perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he
would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane
correspond with his sister she will not be able to help calling
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being
withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that
his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother
she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses
the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its
engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always
made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and
on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths
warm commendation narrowly observed them both without supposing them
from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and
she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure
unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many
acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by
character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute
description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both
him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys
treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam
darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy
mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after
honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking
openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against
him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he
ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you
must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all
expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and
good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of
myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with
mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison
the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to
me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence
of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does
me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my
father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but
since we see every day that where there is affection young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not
to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very
true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine
that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my
honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was
now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that
she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she
rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and
reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her
out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte said
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza
and i have another favour to ask you will you come and see me
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire
i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the
my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i
hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on
the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be
