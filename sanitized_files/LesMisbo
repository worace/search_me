the star of the inner night she that was marius whole thought he
meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat
was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old
that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his
boots were giving out and he said to himself if i could but see her
one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her
glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did
know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place
she still loved him perhaps who knows whether she were not thinking of
him as he was thinking of her sometimes in those inexplicable hours
such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no
reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy
he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming to me then he
this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was
sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope
into his soul from time to time especially at that evening hour which
is the most depressing to even the dreamy he allowed the purest the
most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain
to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else he called this
it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged quite the
contrary he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly
towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more clear sightedness
and rectitude than ever marius surveyed by a calm and real although
peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most indifferent
deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort
of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness his judgment which
was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared
in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and
every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and
of destiny happy even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has
given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness he who has not viewed
the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light
has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true
the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity
however day followed day and nothing new presented itself it
merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be
traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant he thought that
he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss
what he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then
when you have ascended the rue saint jacques left the barrier on one
side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach
the rue de la sante then the glaciere and a little while before
arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of
field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the
boulevards of paris where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down
there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a green
meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter rags
drying in the wind and an old market gardeners house built in the
time of louis xiii with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer
windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid poplar trees
women voices laughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of
the deaf mutes the val de grace black squat fantastic amusing
magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the
as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither hardly one cart
or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour
it chanced that marius solitary strolls led him to this plot of
ground near the water that day there was a rarity on the boulevard
a passer by marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of
the place asked this passer by what is the name of this spot
the person replied it is the larks meadow
and he added it was here that ulbach killed the shepherdess of ivry
but after the word lark marius heard nothing more these sudden
congealments in the state of revery which a single word suffices to
evoke do occur the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an
idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else
the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of
marius melancholy stop said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor
peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow i shall know
and every day he returned to that meadow of the lark
chapter ii embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons
javerts triumph in the gorbeau hovel seemed complete but had not been
in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert
had not taken the prisoner prisoner the assassinated man who flees
is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this
personage who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be
no less fine a prize for the authorities
another opportunity of laying hands on that devils dandy must be
waited for montparnasse had in fact encountered eponine as she stood
on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off
preferring to play nemorin with the daughter rather than schinderhannes
with the father it was well that he did so he was free as for
eponine javert had caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation
and finally on the way from the gorbeau house to la force one of the
principal prisoners claquesous had been lost it was not known how
this had been effected the police agents and the sergeants could
not understand it at all he had converted himself into vapor he had
slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of
the carriage the fiacre was cracked and he had fled all that they
were able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no
claquesous either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it had
claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow flake in water had there
been unavowed connivance of the police agents did this man belong
to the double enigma of order and disorder was he concentric with
infraction and repression had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and
his hind paws in authority javert did not accept such comminations and
would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included
other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he
perhaps although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the
prefecture and claquesous had been such a villain that he might make
a very good agent it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an
admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms
with the night these double edged rascals do exist however that may
be claquesous had gone astray and was not found again javert appeared
to be more irritated than amazed at this
as for marius that booby of a lawyer who had probably become
frightened and whose name javert had forgotten javert attached very
little importance to him moreover a lawyer can be hunted up at any
time but was he a lawyer after all
the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of
the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he
would chatter this man was brujon the long haired man of the rue du
petit banquier he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard and
the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him
this name of brujon is one of the souvenirs of la force in that hideous
courtyard called the court of the batiment neuf new building which
the administration called the court saint bernard and which the robbers
called the fosseaux lions the lions ditch on that wall covered with
scales and leprosy which rose on the left to a level with the roofs
near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the
ducal residence of la force then turned in a dormitory for ruffians
there could still be seen twelve years ago a sort of fortress roughly
carved in the stone with a nail and beneath it this signature
the brujon of 1811 was the father of the brujon of 1832
the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau
house was a very cunning and very adroit young spark with a bewildered
and plaintive air it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the
magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne
robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands
of justice they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as
that to be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on
another crime they are artists who have one picture in the salon and
who toil none the less on a new work in their studios
brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison he could sometimes be seen
standing by the hour together in front of the sutlers window in the
charlemagne yard staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices
which began with garlic 62 centimes and ended with cigar 5
centimes or he passed his time in trembling chattering his teeth
saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the eight and
twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant
all at once towards the end of february 1832 it was discovered that
brujon that somnolent fellow had had three different commissions
executed by the errand men of the establishment not under his own name
but in the name of three of his comrades and they had cost him in all
fifty sous an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the
inquiries were instituted and on consulting the tariff of commissions
posted in the convicts parlor it was learned that the fifty sous could
be analyzed as follows three commissions one to the pantheon ten
sous one to val de grace fifteen sous and one to the barriere de
grenelle twenty five sous this last was the dearest of the whole
tariff now at the pantheon at the val de grace and at the barriere
de grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable
prowlers of the barriers kruideniers alias bizarre glorieux an
ex convict and barre carosse upon whom the attention of the police was
directed by this incident it was thought that these men were members
of patron minette two of those leaders babet and gueulemer had been
captured it was supposed that the messages which had been addressed
not to houses but to people who were waiting for them in the street
must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been
plotted they were in possession of other indications they laid hand on
the three prowlers and supposed that they had circumvented some one or
about a week after these measures had been taken one night as the
superintendent of the watch who had been inspecting the lower dormitory
in the batiment neuf was about to drop his chestnut in the box this
was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their
duties punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the
boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through
the peep hole of the dormitory and beheld brujon sitting on his bed and
writing something by the light of the hall lamp the guardian entered
brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month but they were not able to
seize what he had written the police learned nothing further about it
what is certain is that on the following morning a postilion
was flung from the charlemagne yard into the lions ditch over the
five story building which separated the two court yards
what prisoners call a postilion is a pellet of bread artistically
moulded which is sent into ireland that is to say over the roofs of a
prison from one courtyard to another etymology over england from one
land to another into ireland this little pellet falls in the yard the
man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some
prisoner in that yard if it is a prisoner who finds the treasure he
forwards the note to its destination if it is a keeper or one of the
prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the
galleys the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police
on this occasion the postilion reached its address although the person
to whom it was addressed was at that moment in solitary confinement
this person was no other than babet one of the four heads of patron
the postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines
babet there is an affair in the rue plumet a gate on a garden
this is what brujon had written the night before
in spite of male and female searchers babet managed to pass the note on
from la force to the salpetriere to a good friend whom he had and who
was shut up there this woman in turn transmitted the note to another
woman of her acquaintance a certain magnon who was strongly suspected
by the police though not yet arrested this magnon whose name the
reader has already seen had relations with the thenardier which will
be described in detail later on and she could by going to see eponine
serve as a bridge between the salpetriere and les madelonettes
it happened that at precisely that moment as proofs were wanting
in the investigation directed against thenardier in the matter of his
daughters eponine and azelma were released when eponine came out
magnon who was watching the gate of the madelonettes handed her
brujons note to babet charging her to look into the matter
eponine went to the rue plumet recognized the gate and the garden
observed the house spied lurked and a few days later brought to
magnon who delivers in the rue clocheperce a biscuit which magnon
transmitted to babets mistress in the salpetriere a biscuit in the
shady symbolism of prisons signifies nothing to be done
so that in less than a week from that time as brujon and babet met in
the circle of la force the one on his way to the examination the other
biscuit replied babet thus did the foetus of crime engendered by
this miscarriage had its consequences however which were perfectly
distinct from brujons programme the reader will see what they were
often when we think we are knotting one thread we are tying quite
marius no longer went to see any one but he sometimes encountered
while marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be
called the cellar stairs and which lead to places without light where
the happy can be heard walking overhead m mabeuf was descending on his
the flora of cauteretz no longer sold at all the experiments on indigo
had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz which had
a bad exposure m mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which
love shade and dampness nevertheless he did not become discouraged he
had obtained a corner in the jardin des plantes with a good exposure
to make his trials with indigo at his own expense for this purpose he
had pawned his copperplates of the flora he had reduced his breakfast
to two eggs and he left one of these for his old servant to whom he
had paid no wages for the last fifteen months and often his breakfast
was his only meal he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had
grown morose and no longer received visitors marius did well not to
dream of going thither sometimes at the hour when m mabeuf was on his
way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed
each other on the boulevard de lhopital they did not speak and only
exchanged a melancholy sign of the head a heart breaking thing it is
that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds two men who have
royal the bookseller was dead m mabeuf no longer knew his books
his garden or his indigo these were the three forms which happiness
pleasure and hope had assumed for him this sufficed him for his
living he said to himself when i shall have made my balls of blueing
i shall be rich i will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn shop
i will put my flora in vogue again with trickery plenty of money and
advertisements in the newspapers and i will buy i know well where a
copy of pierre de medines art de naviguer with wood cuts edition of
1655 in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and
at night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books at
that epoch m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age
he had returned home while it was still broad daylight mother
plutarque whose health was declining was ill and in bed he had dined
on a bone on which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he
had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned
stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden
near this bench there rose after the fashion in orchard gardens a sort
of large chest of beams and planks much dilapidated a rabbit hutch on
the ground floor a fruit closet on the first there was nothing in the
hutch but there were a few apples in the fruit closet the remains of
m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of
his glasses two books of which he was passionately fond and in which
a serious thing at his age he was interested his natural timidity
rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain
degree the first of these books was the famous treatise of president
delancre de linconstance des demons the other was a quarto by mutor
de la rubaudiere sur les diables de vauvert et les gobelins de la
bievre this last mentioned old volume interested him all the more
because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in
former times the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to
blacken all below as he read over the top of the book which he held
in his hand father mabeuf was surveying his plants and among others a
magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of
heat wind and sun without a drop of rain had passed the stalks were
bending the buds drooping the leaves falling all this needed water
the rhododendron was particularly sad father mabeuf was one of those
persons for whom plants have souls the old man had toiled all day over
his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid
his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering
footsteps to the well but when he had grasped the chain he could not
even draw it sufficiently to unhook it then he turned round and cast a
glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars
the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man
beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy the night promised to
be as arid as the day had been
stars everywhere thought the old man not the tiniest cloud not a
and his head which had been upraised for a moment fell back upon his
he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring
he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not
at that moment he heard a voice saying
father mabeuf would you like to have me water your garden for you
at the same time a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible
in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall
slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at
him she had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just
before father mabeuf who was easily terrified and who was as we have
said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this
being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had
unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the
watering pot and the goodman beheld this apparition which had bare
feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the flower beds
distributing life around her the sound of the watering pot on the
leaves filled father mabeufs soul with ecstasy it seemed to him that
the first bucketful emptied the girl drew a second then a third she
there was something about her as she thus ran about among paths where
her outline appeared perfectly black waving her angular arms and with
her fichu all in rags that resembled a bat
when she had finished father mabeuf approached her with tears in his
eyes and laid his hand on her brow
god will bless you said he you are an angel since you take care of
no she replied i am the devil but thats all the same to me
the old man exclaimed without either waiting for or hearing her
what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor and that i can do nothing
the old man did not understand what monsieur marius
he raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had
a young man who used to come here
in the meantime m mabeuf had searched his memory
ah yes  he exclaimed i know what you mean wait monsieur
marius the baron marius pontmercy parbleu he lives or rather he no
as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he
hold i know now he very often passes along the boulevard and goes in
the direction of the glaciere rue croulebarbe the meadow of the lark
go there it is not hard to meet him
when m mabeuf straightened himself up there was no longer any one
really he thought if my garden had not been watered i should think
an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell
asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird
which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by
little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said
in sooth that greatly resembles what rubaudiere narrates of the
some days after this visit of a spirit to farmer mabeuf one
morning it was on a monday the day when marius borrowed the
hundred sou piece from courfeyrac for thenardier marius had put this
coin in his pocket and before carrying it to the clerks office he
had gone to take a little stroll in the hope that this would make him
work on his return it was always thus however as soon as he rose he
seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble
some translation his task at that epoch consisted in turning into
french a celebrated quarrel between germans the gans and savigny
controversy he took savigny he took gans read four lines tried to
write one could not saw a star between him and his paper and rose
from his chair saying i shall go out that will put me in spirits
and off he went to the larks meadow
there he beheld more than ever the star and less than ever savigny and
he returned home tried to take up his work again and did not succeed
there was no means of re knotting a single one of the threads which
were broken in his brain then he said to himself i will not go out
to morrow it prevents my working and he went out every day
he lived in the larks meadow more than in courfeyracs lodgings that
was his real address boulevard de la sante at the seventh tree from
that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on
the parapet of the river des gobelins a cheerful sunlight penetrated
he was dreaming of her and his meditation turning to a reproach fell
back upon himself he reflected dolefully on his idleness his paralysis
of soul which was gaining on him and of that night which was growing
more dense every moment before him to such a point that he no longer
nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which
was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he
had no longer the force to care to despair athwart this melancholy
absorption sensations from without did reach him he heard behind him
beneath him on both banks of the river the laundresses of the gobelins
beating their linen and above his head the birds chattering and
singing in the elm trees on the one hand the sound of liberty the
careless happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other the
sound of toil what caused him to meditate deeply and almost reflect
all at once in the midst of his dejected ecstasy he heard a familiar
he raised his eyes and recognized that wretched child who had come to
him one morning the elder of the thenardier daughters eponine he knew
her name now strange to say she had grown poorer and prettier
two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take she had
accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress
she was barefooted and in rags as on the day when she had so resolutely
entered his chamber only her rags were two months older now the holes
were larger the tatters more sordid it was the same harsh voice
the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan the same free wild and
vacillating glance she had besides more than formerly in her face
that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a
she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through
having gone mad from the contagion of hamlets madness but because she
had slept in the loft of some stable
and in spite of it all she was beautiful what a star art thou o
in the meantime she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy
in her livid countenance and something which resembled a smile
she stood for several moments as though incapable of speech
so i have met you at last she said at length father mabeuf was
right it was on this boulevard how i have hunted for you if you only
knew do you know i have been in the jug a fortnight they let me out
seeing that there was nothing against me and that moreover i had not
reached years of discretion i lack two months of it oh how i have
hunted for you these six weeks so you dont live down there any more
ah i understand because of that affair those take downs are
disagreeable you cleared out come now why do you wear old hats like
this a young man like you ought to have fine clothes do you know
monsieur marius father mabeuf calls you baron marius i dont know
what it isnt true that you are a baron barons are old fellows they
go to the luxembourg in front of the chateau where there is the most
sun and they read the quotidienne for a sou i once carried a letter to
a baron of that sort he was over a hundred years old say where do you
ah she went on you have a hole in your shirt i must sew it up for
she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over
marius held his peace she remained silent for a moment then
but if i choose nevertheless i could force you to look glad
ah you used to call me thou she retorted
she bit her lips she seemed to hesitate as though a prey to some sort
of inward conflict at last she appeared to come to a decision
so much the worse i dont care you have a melancholy air i want you
to be pleased only promise me that you will smile i want to see you
smile and hear you say ah well thats good poor mr marius you
know you promised me that you would give me anything i like 
she looked marius full in the eye and said
marius turned pale all the blood flowed back to his heart
the address that you asked me to get
marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized
oh well lead me thither tell me ask of me anything you wish where
come with me she responded i dont know the street or number very
well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house
she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent
the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his
a cloud swept across marius brow he seized eponine by the arm
swear said she what does that mean come you want me to swear
your father promise me eponine swear to me that you will not give
she turned to him with a stupefied air
eponine how do you know that my name is eponine
but she did not seem to hear him
but answer me in the name of heaven pay attention to what i am saying
to you swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that
my father said she ah yes my father be at ease hes in close
confinement besides what do i care for my father
but you do not promise me exclaimed marius
let go of me she said bursting into a laugh how you do shake me
yes yes i promise that i swear that to you what is that to me i
will not tell my father the address there is that right is that it
come along ah how pleased he is said she
you are following me too closely monsieur marius let me go on ahead
and follow me so without seeming to do it a nice young man like you
must not be seen with a woman like me
no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced
she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined
her she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him
by the way you know that you promised me something
marius fumbled in his pocket all that he owned in the world was the
five francs intended for thenardier the father he took them and laid
she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at
book third the house in the rue plumet
about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament
of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period
the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois
concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg
saint germain in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue
plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des
this house was composed of a single storied pavilion two rooms on the
ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs
a boudoir up stairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a
garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about
an acre and a half in extent this was all that could be seen by
passers by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and
at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and
a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse
in case of need this building communicated in the rear by a masked
door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding
corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden
with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and
cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in
another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league
away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du
through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were
spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the
justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and
would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go
to the rue blomet thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate
had been able to make a secret sewer like passage on his own property
and consequently without interference later on he had sold in little
parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining
the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought
they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the
long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower beds and
their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity it is probable
that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal
the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and
furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside old fashioned
on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something
discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love
this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence
fifteen years ago in 93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with
the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the
nation made him bankrupt so that it was the house which demolished the
coppersmith after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly
to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not
communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was
always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed
through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible
bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819
towards the end of the restoration these same passers by might have
noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the
first floor were open the house was occupied in fact the windows had
short curtains a sign that there was a woman about
in the month of october 1829 a man of a certain age had presented
himself and had hired the house just as it stood including of course
the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylone he
had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired
the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished
with the justices old fitting the new tenant had ordered some
repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the
paving stones in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs
missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows
and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly
maid servant without commotion rather like a person who is slipping
in than like a man who is entering his own house the neighbors did not
gossip about him for the reason that there were no neighbors
this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette
the servant was a woman named toussaint whom jean valjean had saved
from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly a
stammerer and from the provinces three qualities which had decided
jean valjean to take her with him he had hired the house under the name
of m fauchelevent independent gentleman in all that has been
related heretofore the reader has doubtless been no less prompt than
why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit picpus what had
it will be remembered that jean valjean was happy in the convent so
happy that his conscience finally took the alarm he saw cosette every
day he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more
he brooded over the soul of that child he said to himself that she
was his that nothing could take her from him that this would last
indefinitely that she would certainly become a nun being thereto
gently incited every day that thus the convent was henceforth the
universe for her as it was for him that he should grow old there and
that she would grow up there that she would grow old there and that
he should die there that in short delightful hope no separation
was possible on reflecting upon this he fell into perplexity he
interrogated himself he asked himself if all that happiness were
really his if it were not composed of the happiness of another of
the happiness of that child which he an old man was confiscating and
stealing if that were not theft he said to himself that this child
had a right to know life before renouncing it that to deprive her in
advance and in some sort without consulting her of all joys under
the pretext of saving her from all trials to take advantage of her
ignorance of her isolation in order to make an artificial vocation
germinate in her was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie
to god and who knows if when she came to be aware of all this some
day and found herself a nun to her sorrow cosette would not come to
hate him a last almost selfish thought and less heroic than the rest
but which was intolerable to him he resolved to quit the convent
he resolved on this he recognized with anguish the fact that it was
necessary as for objections there were none five years sojourn
between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed
or dispersed the elements of fear he could return tranquilly among men
he had grown old and all had undergone a change who would recognize
him now and then to face the worst there was danger only for himself
and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason
that he had been condemned to the galleys besides what is danger in
comparison with the right finally nothing prevented his being prudent
as for cosettes education it was almost finished and complete
his determination once taken he awaited an opportunity it was not long
jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her
that having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother
which permitted him henceforth to live without working he should leave
the service of the convent and take his daughter with him but that as
it was not just that cosette since she had not taken the vows should
have received her education gratuitously he humbly begged the reverend
prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community as indemnity
for the five years which cosette had spent there the sum of five
it was thus that jean valjean quitted the convent of the perpetual
on leaving the convent he took in his own arms the little valise the
key to which he still wore on his person and would permit no porter to
touch it this puzzled cosette because of the odor of embalming which
let us state at once that this trunk never quitted him more he always
had it in his chamber it was the first and only thing sometimes that
he carried off in his moving when he moved about cosette laughed at it
and called this valise his inseparable saying i am jealous of it
nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without
he discovered the house in the rue plumet and hid himself from
sight there henceforth he was in the possession of the name ultime
at the same time he hired two other apartments in paris in order that
he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the
same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the
slightest disquietude which should assail him and in short so that
he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had
so miraculously escaped from javert these two apartments were very
pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote
from each other the one in the rue de louest the other in the rue de
he went from time to time now to the rue de lhomme arme now to the
rue de louest to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint
he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as a
gentleman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little
temporary resting place in town this lofty virtue had three domiciles
in paris for the sake of escaping from the police
chapter ii jean valjean as a national guard
however properly speaking he lived in the rue plumet and he had
arranged his existence there in the following fashion
cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big
sleeping room with the painted pier glasses the boudoir with the gilded
fillets the justices drawing room furnished with tapestries and vast
arm chairs she had the garden jean valjean had a canopied bed of
antique damask in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in
the rue du figuier saint paul at mother gauchers put into cosettes
chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent
old things he had amalgamated with this bric a brac all the gay and
graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls an etagere
a bookcase filled with gilt edged books an inkstand a blotting book
paper a work table incrusted with mother of pearl a silver gilt
dressing case a toilet service in japanese porcelain long damask
curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the
bed hung at the windows of the first floor on the ground floor the
curtains were of tapestry all winter long cosettes little house was
heated from top to bottom jean valjean inhabited the sort of porters
lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a
mattress on a folding bed a white wood table two straw chairs an
earthenware water jug a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise
in one corner and never any fire he dined with cosette and he had a
loaf of black bread on the table for his own use
when toussaint came he had said to her it is the young lady who is
the mistress of this house and you monsieur toussaint replied in
amazement i am a much better thing than the master i am the father
cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated
their expenditure which was very modest every day jean valjean put
his arm through cosettes and took her for a walk he led her to the
luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her
to mass at saint jacques du haut pas because that was a long way off
as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed alms largely there and the
poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him
thenardiers epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of
saint jacques du haut pas he was fond of taking cosette to visit the
poor and the sick no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet
toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for
water to a fountain near by on the boulevard their wood and wine were
put into a half subterranean hollow lined with rock work which lay near
the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the chief justice as
a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was
in the door opening on the rue de babylone there was a box destined for
the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of
the pavilion in the rue plumet received neither papers nor letters the
entire usefulness of that box formerly the go between of a love
affair and the confidant of a love lorn lawyer was now limited to
the tax collectors notices and the summons of the guard for m
fauchelevent independent gentleman belonged to the national guard
he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of
1831 the municipal information collected at that time had even reached
the convent of the petit picpus a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud
whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently
worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall
three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted
guard he did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which
mixed him with every one and yet left him solitary jean valjean had
just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he
did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape
his sergeant major nor to quibble with comte de lobau he possessed
no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his
identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we
have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum
of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes this
man had for his ideal within the angel without the bourgeois
let us note one detail however when jean valjean went out with
cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of
a retired officer when he went out alone which was generally at night
he was always dressed in a workingmans trousers and blouse and wore
a cap which concealed his face was this precaution or humility both
cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny and
hardly noticed her fathers peculiarities as for toussaint she
venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right
one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to
her thats a queer fish she replied hes a saint
neither jean valjean nor cosette nor toussaint ever entered or emerged
except by the door on the rue de babylone unless seen through the
garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in
the rue plumet that gate was always closed jean valjean had left the
garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention
the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become
extraordinary and charming the passers by of forty years ago halted to
gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh
and verdant depths more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed
his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of
