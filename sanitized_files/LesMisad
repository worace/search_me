revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings one morning he was in
his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind
him unseen by him suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the
ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider his sister heard
why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness
puerile they may be but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to
saint francis dassisi and of marcus aurelius one day he sprained his
ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant thus lived this just
man sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories anent his youth
and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate
and possibly a violent man his universal suavity was less an instinct
of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into
his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly
thought by thought for in a character as in a rock there may exist
apertures made by drops of water these hollows are uneffaceable these
in 1815 as we think we have already said he reached his seventy fifth
birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty he was not tall
he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond
of taking long strolls on foot his step was firm and his form was
but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any
conclusion gregory xvi at the age of eighty held himself erect and
smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop monseigneur
welcome had what the people term a fine head but so amiable was he
when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his
charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease
with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person his fresh and
ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved
and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air
which cause the remark to be made of a man hes a good fellow and
of an old man he is a fine man that it will be recalled was the
effect which he produced upon napoleon on the first encounter and to
one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine
man but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the
least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and
took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious
brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue
of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness
ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which
one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings
without ceasing to smile respect an unutterable respect penetrated
you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had
before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls
where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion
alms giving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit
study work filled every day of his life filled is exactly the word
certainly the bishops day was quite full to the brim of good words and
good deeds nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather
prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed
and after the two women had retired it seemed to be a sort of rite with
him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of
the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens sometimes if the two old
women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at
a very advanced hour of the night he was there alone communing with
himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the
serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor
of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his
heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown at such moments
while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer
their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he
poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of
creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in
his spirit he felt something take its flight from him and something
descend into him mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity
that strange mystery of the eternity past a mystery still more
strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all
his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the
incomprehensible he gazed upon it he did not study god he was dazzled
by him he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms which
communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create
individualities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the
infinite and through light produce beauty these conjunctions are
formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death
he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit
vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes
of his fruit trees this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so
encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied
what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his
life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the
daytime and contemplation at night was not this narrow enclosure with
the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore god in his
most divine works in turn does not this comprehend all in fact and
what is there left to desire beyond it a little garden in which to
walk and immensity in which to dream at ones feet that which can be
cultivated and plucked over head that which one can study and meditate
upon some flowers on earth and all the stars in the sky
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment
and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop of d a
certain pantheistical physiognomy and induce the belief either
to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal
philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring
up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they
usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of
those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself
authorized to think anything of the sort that which enlightened this
man was his heart his wisdom was made of the light which comes from
no systems many works abstruse speculations contain vertigo no
there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses the
apostle may be daring but the bishop must be timid he would probably
have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems
which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds there is a
sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy openings
stand yawning there but something tells you you a passer by in life
that you must not enter woe to him who penetrates thither
geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation
situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to
god their prayer audaciously offers discussion their adoration
interrogates this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and
responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs
human meditation has no limits at his own risk and peril it analyzes
and digs deep into its own bedazzlement one might almost say that by
a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzles nature the mysterious
world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is
probable that the contemplators are contemplated however that may be
there are on earth men who are they men perceive distinctly at the
verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute and who
have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain monseigneur welcome
was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius he would
have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even like
swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity certainly these
powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths
one approaches to ideal perfection as for him he took the path which
he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of elijahs
mantle he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of
events he did not seek to condense in flame the light of things he
had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him this
that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is
probable but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much
and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint
he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates the universe
appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever
everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to
solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound the terrible spectacle
of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only
in finding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to
compassionate and relieve that which exists was for this good and rare
priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
there are men who toil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction
of pity universal misery was his mine the sadness which reigned
everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness love each other he
declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the
whole of his doctrine one day that man who believed himself to be a
philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the
bishop just survey the spectacle of the world all war against
all the strongest has the most wit your love each other is
nonsense well replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the
point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself up in it as the
pearl in the oyster thus he shut himself up he lived there he
was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious
questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of
abstraction the precipices of metaphysics all those profundities
which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness
destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience
of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal the transformation
in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the
incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent i
the essence the substance the nile and the ens the soul nature
lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses
which lucretius manou saint paul dante contemplate with eyes
flashing lightning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to
monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of
mysterious questions without scrutinizing them and without troubling
his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave
chapter i the evening of a day of walking
early in the month of october 1815 about an hour before sunset a
man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d the few
inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the
moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness it was
difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance he was
a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life
he might have been forty six or forty eight years old a cap with a
drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and tanned by
sun and wind and dripping with perspiration his shirt of coarse yellow
linen fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view
of his hairy breast he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of
blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the
other an old gray tattered blouse patched on one of the elbows with
a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine a tightly packed soldier
knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous
knotty stick in his hand iron shod shoes on his stockingless feet a
the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not
what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole his hair was closely cut
yet bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to
no one knew him he was evidently only a chance passer by whence came
he from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance
into d by the same street which seven months previously had
witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes
to paris this man must have been walking all day he seemed very much
fatigued some women of the ancient market town which is situated below
the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi
and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade he
must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him
stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in
on arriving at the corner of the rue poichevert he turned to the left
and directed his steps toward the town hall he entered then came out
a quarter of an hour later a gendarme was seated near the door on the
stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the 4th of march to read
to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of d the proclamation
of the gulf juan the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the
the gendarme without replying to his salute stared attentively at him
followed him for a while with his eyes and then entered the town hall
there then existed at d a fine inn at the sign of the cross of
colbas this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin labarre a man
of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another
labarre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had
served in the guides at the time of the emperors landing many rumors
had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the
three dauphins it was said that general bertrand disguised as a
carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and
that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls
of gold to the citizens the truth is that when the emperor entered
grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the
prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house
of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had betaken himself to the
three dauphins this glory of the labarre of the three dauphins was
reflected upon the labarre of the cross of colbas at a distance of five
and twenty leagues it was said of him in the town that is the cousin
the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the
country side he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the
street all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazed gayly in the
fireplace the host who was also the chief cook was going from one
stew pan to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner
designed for the wagoners whose loud talking conversation and
laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment any one who has
travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than
wagoners a fat marmot flanked by white partridges and heather cocks
was turning on a long spit before the fire on the stove two huge carps
from lake lauzet and a trout from lake alloz were cooking
the host hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said
nothing easier replied the host at that moment he turned his head
took in the travellers appearance with a single glance and added by
the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and
in that case we are at your service said the host
the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from
his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his
hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire d is in
the mountains the evenings are cold there in october
but as the host went back and forth he scrutinized the traveller
will dinner be ready soon said the man
while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back
turned the worthy host jacquin labarre drew a pencil from his pocket
then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small
table near the window on the white margin he wrote a line or two
folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to
a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and
lackey the landlord whispered a word in the scullions ear and the
child set off on a run in the direction of the town hall
once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon
the child returned he brought back the paper the host unfolded it
eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply he seemed to read it
attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment
then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to
be immersed in reflections which were not very serene
what are you afraid that i will not pay you do you want me to pay you
in advance i have money i tell you
and i said the host have no room
the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable
very well retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of
straw we will see about that after dinner
this declaration made in a measured but firm tone struck the stranger
ah bah but i am dying of hunger i have been walking since sunrise i
have travelled twelve leagues i pay i wish to eat
the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the
they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance
the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am
at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain
then the host bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him
at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some
brands into the fire with the iron shod tip of his staff he turned
quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host gazed
steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop theres enough
of that sort of talk do you want me to tell you your name your name is
jean valjean now do you want me to tell you who you are when i saw you
come in i suspected something i sent to the town hall and this was the
reply that was sent to me can you read
so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which
had just travelled from the inn to the town hall and from the town hall
to the inn the man cast a glance upon it the landlord resumed after a
i am in the habit of being polite to every one go away
the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited
he chose the principal street he walked straight on at a venture
keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man he did not
turn round a single time had he done so he would have seen the host
of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold surrounded by all
the guests of his inn and all the passers by in the street talking
vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances
of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his
arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this people who are crushed do not look behind
them they know but too well the evil fate which follows them
thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing
at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue
as is often the case when a man is sad all at once he felt the pangs
of hunger sharply night was drawing near he glanced about him to see
the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble
just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets a pine branch
suspended from a cross beam of iron was outlined against the white sky
it proved to be in fact a public house the public house which is in
the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the
interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by a
small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth some men were
engaged in drinking there the landlord was warming himself an iron
pot suspended from a crane bubbled over the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by
two doors one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled
with manure the traveller dare not enter by the street door he slipped
into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened
he entered all the men who were drinking turned round the lamp
illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other they examined
him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire the supper is cooking in the
he approached and seated himself near the hearth he stretched out his
feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was
emitted by the pot all that could be distinguished of his face beneath
his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance
of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual
it was moreover a firm energetic and melancholy profile this
physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and
ended by seeming severe the eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire
one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who
before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut had been to
stable his horse at labarres it chanced that he had that very morning
encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras
dasse and i have forgotten the name i think it was escoublon now
when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had
requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had
made no reply except by redoubling his gait this fishmonger had been
a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin
labarre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the
morning to the people at the cross of colbas from where he sat he made
an imperceptible sign to the tavern keeper the tavern keeper went to
him they exchanged a few words in a low tone the man had again become
the tavern keeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on
the shoulder of the man and said to him
you are going to get out of here
the stranger turned round and replied gently ah you know 
i was sent away from the other inn
and you are to be turned out of this one
the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of
colbas and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him
he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick the
he passed before the prison at the door hung an iron chain attached to
turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the
kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night
the prison is not an inn get yourself arrested and you will be
he entered a little street in which there were many gardens some of
them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the
street in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a
small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up he
peered through the pane as he had done at the public house within was a
large whitewashed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and
a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a double barrelled gun
hanging on the wall a table was spread in the centre of the room a
copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter
jug shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking
soup tureen at this table sat a man of about forty with a merry and
open countenance who was dandling a little child on his knees close by
a very young woman was nursing another child the father was laughing
the child was laughing the mother was smiling
the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming
spectacle what was taking place within him he alone could have
told it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be
hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he
he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock
he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that some one is
the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan he wore a
huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a
hammer a red handkerchief a powder horn and all sorts of objects
which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out he
carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned
back displayed his bull neck white and bare he had thick eyelashes
enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face
like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of
payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the
garden in which to sleep tell me can you for money
who are you demanded the master of the house
the man replied i have just come from puy moisson i have walked all
day long i have travelled twelve leagues can you if i pay
i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man
who would pay me but why do you not go to the inn
bah impossible this is neither a fair nor a market day have you been
the traveller replied with embarrassment i do not know he did not
have you been to whats his names in the rue chaffaut
the strangers embarrassment increased he stammered he did not
the peasants countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed
the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of
he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards
placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man the woman had risen had
clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately
behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom
uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low tone
all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to
ones self after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one
scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and
for pitys sake a glass of water said the man
a shot from my gun said the peasant
then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large
bolts a moment later the window shutter was closed and the sound of a
bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall a cold wind from the alps was blowing by the
light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens
which bordered the street a sort of hut which seemed to him to be
built of sods he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found
himself in the garden he approached the hut its door consisted of a
very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which
road laborers construct for themselves along the roads he thought
without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he
was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter
from the cold this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut it was warm
there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw he lay for a moment
stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so
fatigued was he then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and
as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about
unbuckling one of the straps at that moment a ferocious growl became
audible he raised his eyes the head of an enormous dog was outlined in
the darkness at the entrance of the hut
he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff
made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the
best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged
in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre
with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la
when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found
himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter
without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and
from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a
stone and it appears that a passer by heard him exclaim i am not even
he soon rose again and resumed his march he went out of the town
hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford
he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping when he felt
himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed
searchingly about him he was in a field before him was one of those
low hills covered with close cut stubble which after the harvest
the horizon was perfectly black this was not alone the obscurity of
night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest
upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole
sky meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still
floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these
clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a
the earth was thus better lighted than the sky which produces a
particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and
mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon the whole
there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree
which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of
intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious
aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky
in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly
desolate that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back
abruptly there are instants when nature seems hostile
he retraced his steps the gates of d were closed d  which had
sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded
in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been
demolished since he passed through a breach and entered the town again
it might have been eight oclock in the evening as he was not
acquainted with the streets he recommenced his walk at random
in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary as he
passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment it is
there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard
to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon
worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down
on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
at that moment an old woman came out of the church she saw the man
stretched out in the shadow what are you doing there my friend said
he answered harshly and angrily as you see my good woman i am
sleeping the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was
i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man
to day i have a mattress of stone
why do you not go to the inn
alas said madame de r  i have only four sous in my purse
the man took the four sous madame de r continued you cannot
obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum but have you tried it is
impossible for you to pass the night thus you are cold and hungry no
doubt some one might have given you a lodging out of charity
the good woman touched the mans arm and pointed out to him on the
other side of the street a small low house which stood beside the
that evening the bishop of d  after his promenade through the town
remained shut up rather late in his room he was busy over a great work
on duties which was never completed unfortunately he was carefully
compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this
important subject his book was divided into two parts firstly the
duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the
class to which he belongs the duties of all are the great duties there
are four of these saint matthew points them out duties towards god
matt vi duties towards ones self matt v 29 30 duties towards
ones neighbor matt vii 12 duties towards animals matt vi 20
25 as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and
prescribed elsewhere to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the
romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint
peter to husbands fathers children and servants in the epistle
to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to
virgins in the epistle to the corinthians out of these precepts he was
laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present
at eight oclock he was still at work writing with a good deal of
inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his
knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the
silver ware from the cupboard near his bed a moment later the bishop
knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably
waiting for him shut his book rose from his table and entered the
the dining room was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a
door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on
madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the
as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle
a lamp stood on the table the table was near the fireplace a wood fire
one can easily picture to ones self these two women both of whom
were over sixty years of age madame magloire small plump vivacious
mademoiselle baptistine gentle slender frail somewhat taller than her
brother dressed in a gown of puce colored silk of the fashion of 1806
which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted
ever since to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving
utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly
suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and
mademoiselle baptistine that of a lady madame magloire wore a white
quilted cap a gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck
the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very
white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff with
large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks
knotted round the waist with a green ribbon with a stomacher of the
same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her
feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles mademoiselle
baptistines gown was cut on the patterns of 1806 with a short waist
a narrow sheath like skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons
she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two
corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was
larger than the lower imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious
look so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him
resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as
monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like
her mistress mademoiselle baptistine did not even speak she confined
herself to obeying and pleasing him she had never been pretty even
when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and a long
arched nose but her whole visage her whole person breathed forth an
ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning she had always been
predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues
which mildly warm the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to
sanctity nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel
poor sainted virgin sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the
episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living
at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with
considerable vivacity she was haranguing mademoiselle baptistine on
a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also
accustomed the question concerned the lock upon the entrance door
it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame
magloire had heard things in divers places people had spoken of a
prowler of evil appearance a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must
be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their
heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant
encounters the police was very badly organized moreover because there
was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure
each other by making things happen it behooved wise people to play the
part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be
taken to duly close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the
madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just
come from his room where it was rather cold he seated himself in front
of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other
things he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame
magloire she repeated it then mademoiselle baptistine desirous of
satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to
did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop then
half turning in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising
towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew
joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come
what is the matter what is the matter are we in any great danger
then madame magloire began the whole story afresh exaggerating it a
little without being aware of the fact it appeared that a bohemian a
bare footed vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment
in the town he had presented himself at jacquin labarres to obtain
lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in he had
been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about
the streets in the gloaming a gallows bird with a terrible face
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed
to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed
yes monseigneur that is how it is there will be some sort of
catastrophe in this town to night every one says so and withal the
police is so badly regulated a useful repetition the idea of living
in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at
night one goes out black as ovens indeed and i say monseigneur and
i interrupted his sister say nothing what my brother does is well
madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest
we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will
permit i will go and tell paulin musebois the locksmith to come and
replace the ancient locks on the doors we have them and it is only the
work of a moment for i say that nothing is more terrible than a
door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first
passer by and i say that we need bolts monseigneur if only for this
night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in
and besides even in the middle of the night o mon dieu there is no
at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though some one had given it an
we already know the man it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering
he entered advanced a step and halted leaving the door open behind
him he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hand a
rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes the fire on
the hearth lighted him up he was hideous it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry she trembled
mademoiselle baptistine turned round beheld the man entering and half
started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the
fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became
the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the new comer what he desired
the man rested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man
and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said

ago and am on my way to pontarlier which is my destination i have

kennel the dog bit me and chased me off as though he had been a man
one would have said that he knew who i was i went into the fields
intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars there were no
stars i thought it was going to rain and i re entered the town to
seek the recess of a doorway yonder in the square i meant to sleep
on a stone bench a good woman pointed out your house to me and said
to me knock there i have knocked what is this place do you keep

madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place
