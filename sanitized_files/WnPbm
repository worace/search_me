and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients prince
vasili who still occupied his former important posts formed a
connecting link between these two circles he visited his good friend
anna pavlovna as well as his daughters diplomatic salon and often
in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
and said at helenes what he should have said at anna pavlovnas and
soon after the emperors return prince vasili in a conversation about
the war at anna pavlovnas severely condemned barclay de tolly but was
undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief one of the
visitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having described
how he had that day seen kutuzov the newly chosen chief of the
petersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the man
anna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done
i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility prince
vasili interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them his
election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they did
its all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it is
all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites
prince vasili continued forgetting for a moment that though at helenes
one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna pavlovnas one had to
be ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once now is it
suitable that count kutuzov the oldest general in russia should
preside at that tribunal he will get nothing for his pains how could
they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse who drops
asleep at a council and has the very worst morals a good reputation he
made for himself at bucharest i dont speak of his capacity as a
general but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit blind old
man positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he cant see
anything to play blindmans bluff he cant see at all
this was quite correct on the twenty fourth of july but on the twenty
ninth of july kutuzov received the title of prince this might indicate
a wish to get rid of him and therefore prince vasilis opinion
continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express
it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshal
saltykov arakcheev vyazmitinov lopukhin and kochubey met to consider
the progress of the war this committee came to the conclusion that our
failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the
members of the committee were aware of the emperors dislike of kutuzov
after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as
commander in chief that same day kutuzov was appointed commander in
chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
on the ninth of august prince vasili at anna pavlovnas again met the
man of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna pavlovna
because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
establishments for young ladies prince vasili entered the room with the
air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires
well have you heard the great news prince kutuzov is field marshal
all dissensions are at an end i am so glad so delighted at last we
have a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round at
the man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post of
director could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former
opinion though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna pavlovnas
drawing room and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received the
news with delight he could not resist the temptation
but prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasili of
eh nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasili rapidly in a
deep voice and with a slight cough the voice and cough with which he
he sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about he
went on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the
armies and the whole region powers no commander in chief ever had
before he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smile
god grant it god grant it said anna pavlovna
the man of great merit who was still a novice in court circles
wishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending her former position on
it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those powers
they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read when he said to
kutuzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor
perhaps the heart took no part in that speech said anna pavlovna
oh no no warmly rejoined prince vasili who would not now yield
kutuzov to anyone in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirable
himself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said he
for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before
god grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does not
allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pavlovna
understanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasili said in a
i know for a fact that kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the
tsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the
and prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
kutuzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
oh a very wise man is prince kutuzov i have known him a long time
they even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yet
possess courtly tact that his excellency made it an express condition
that the sovereign himself should not be with the army
as soon as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna turned away
from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete
while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed
smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow napoleons
historian thiers like other of his historians trying to justify his
hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will he
is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
events in the will of one man he is as right as the russian historians
who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the
russian commanders here besides the law of retrospection which regards
all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur the
law of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter a good
chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
opening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect he only notices the
mistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantage
of it how much more complex than this is the game of war which occurs
under certain limits of time and where it is not one will that
manipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerable
after smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma and
then at tsarevo zaymishche but it happened that owing to a conjunction
of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till
they reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon
moscou la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire la ville sacree des
peuples dalexandre moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de
pagodes chinoises  this moscow gave napoleons imagination no rest on
the march from vyazma to tsarevo zaymishche he rode his light bay
bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards his bodyguard his pages
and aides de camp berthier his chief of staff dropped behind to
question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by
lelorgne dideville an interpreter he overtook napoleon at a gallop
and reined in his horse with an amused expression
 moscow the asiatic capital of this great empire the sacred city of
alexanders people moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like
one of platovs cossacks says that platovs corps is joining up with
the main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief he
napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the
man to him he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped
off and an hour later lavrushka the serf denisov had handed over to
rostov rode up to napoleon in an orderlys jacket and on a french
cavalry saddle with a merry and tipsy face napoleon told him to ride
the cossack not knowing in what company he was for napoleons plain
appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind
the presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of the
incidents of the war says thiers narrating this episode in reality
lavrushka having got drunk the day before and left his master
dinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
chickens where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner
lavrushka was one of those coarse bare faced lackeys who have seen all
sorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
cunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their master
and are keen at guessing their masters baser impulses especially those
finding himself in the company of napoleon whose identity he had easily
and surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely
did his utmost to gain his new masters favor
he knew very well that this was napoleon but napoleons presence could
no more intimidate him than rostovs or a sergeant majors with the
rods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard among the
orderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the
russians thought they would beat bonaparte or not lavrushka screwed up
in this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunning
in everything so he frowned and did not answer immediately
its like this he said thoughtfully if theres a battle soon yours
will win thats right but if three days pass then after that well
then that same battle will not soon be over
lelorgne dideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus
if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win
but if later god knows what will happen napoleon did not smile
though he was evidently in high good humor and he ordered these words
lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further pretending not to
we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the
world but we are a different matter without knowing why or how
this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end
the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase and
bonaparte smiled the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor
smile says thiers after riding a few paces in silence napoleon
turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written his
immortally victorious name on the pyramids would affect this enfant du
lavrushka understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new masters
promptly pretended to be astonished and awe struck opened his eyes
wide and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
whipped as soon as napoleons interpreter had spoken says thiers
the cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rode
on his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
the steppes of the east all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration napoleon after
making the cossack a present had him set free like a bird restored to
napoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his
imagination and the bird restored to its native fields galloped to
our outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he did
not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling he found
the cossacks inquired for the regiment operating with platovs
detachment and by evening found his master nicholas rostov quartered
at yankovo rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the
neighboring villages with ilyin he let lavrushka have another horse and
princess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew
after the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenly
seemed to awake as from a dream he ordered the militiamen to be called
up from the villages and armed and wrote a letter to the commander in
chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to the
last extremity and to defend it leaving to the commander in chiefs
discretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills where
one of russias oldest generals would be captured or killed and he
announced to his household that he would remain at bald hills
but while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure of
the princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo and
thence to moscow princess mary alarmed by her fathers feverish and
sleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring herself to
leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
him she refused to go away and her fathers fury broke over her in a
terrible storm he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
her trying to convict her he told her she had worn him out had caused
his quarrel with his son had harbored nasty suspicions of him making
it the object of her life to poison his existence and he drove her from
his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to
him he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
warned her not to dare to let him see her the fact that he did not as
she had feared order her to be carried away by force but only told her
not to let him see her cheered princess mary she knew it was a proof
that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
the morning after little nicholas had left the old prince donned his
full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief his caleche
was already at the door princess mary saw him walk out of the house in
his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
armed peasants and domestic serfs she sat by the window listening to
his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly several men came
princess mary ran out to the porch down the flower bordered path and
into the avenue a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
toward her and in their midst several men were supporting by the
armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
decorations she ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight that
fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime tree avenue
could not be sure what change there was in his face all she could see
was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
of timidity and submission on seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
lips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out what he
wanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on the very
the doctor who was fetched that same night bled him and said that the
prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side
it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and
next day they moved the prince to bogucharovo the doctor accompanying
by the time they reached bogucharovo dessalles and the little prince
for three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
house prince andrew had built at bogucharovo ever in the same state
getting neither better nor worse he was unconscious and lay like a
distorted corpse he muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lips
twitching and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
going on around him or not one thing was certain that he was suffering
and wished to say something but what it was no one could tell it
might be some caprice of a sick and half crazy man or it might relate
to public affairs or possibly to family concerns
the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to
physical causes but princess mary thought he wished to tell her
something and the fact that her presence always increased his
he was evidently suffering both physically and mentally there was no
hope of recovery it was impossible for him to travel it would not do
to let him die on the road would it not be better if the end did come
the very end princess mary sometimes thought night and day hardly
sleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched him
not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet
there it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
her fathers illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed with
him expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopes
that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened thoughts
that had not entered her mind for years thoughts of a life free from
the fear of her father and even the possibility of love and of family
happiness floated continually in her imagination like temptations of
the devil thrust them aside as she would questions continually
recurred to her as to how she would order her life now after that
these were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it she knew
that the sole weapon against him was prayer and she tried to pray she
assumed an attitude of prayer looked at the icons repeated the words
of a prayer but she could not pray she felt that a different world had
now taken possession of her the life of a world of strenuous and free
activity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had
been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer she
could not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession of
it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo news of the approach
of the french came from all sides and in one village ten miles from
bogucharovo a homestead had been looted by french marauders
the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince the
provincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to
persuade her to get away as quickly as possible and the head of the
rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing saying
that the french were only some twenty five miles away that french
proclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princess
did not take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answer
the princess decided to leave on the fifteenth the cares of preparation
and giving orders for which everyone came to her occupied her all day
she spent the night of the fourteenth as usual without undressing in
the room next to the one where the prince lay several times waking up
she heard his groans and muttering the creak of his bed and the steps
of tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over several times she
listened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener she could not
sleep and several times went to the door and listened wishing to enter
but not deciding to do so though he did not speak princess mary saw
and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him
she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
sometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in during
the night at an unusual hour would irritate him
but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
him she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
found an expression of his love of her occasionally amid these memories
temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination thoughts of
how things would be after his death and how her new liberated life
would be ordered but she drove these thoughts away with disgust toward
morning he became quiet and she fell asleep
she woke late that sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fathers illness on waking
she listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing him
groan said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same
but what could have happened what did i want i want his death she
cried with a feeling of loathing for herself
she washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch in
front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
it was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch still
horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
before going to her father the doctor came downstairs and went out to
he is a little better today said he i was looking for you one can
make out something of what he is saying his head is clearer come in
princess marys heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
and leaned against the wall to keep from falling to see him talk to
him feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment of joy and terror
princess mary entered her fathers room and went up to his bed he was
lying on his back propped up high and his small bony hands with their
knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt his left eye gazed
straight before him his right eye was awry and his brows and lips
motionless he seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his face
seemed to have shriveled or melted his features had grown smaller
princess mary went up and kissed his hand his left hand pressed hers so
that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come he
twitched her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrily
she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her when
she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
calmed down not taking his eyes off her for some seconds then his lips
and tongue moved sounds came and he began to speak gazing timidly and
imploringly at her evidently afraid that she might not understand
straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comic
efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat he said something
repeating the same words several times she could not understand them
but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
it was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thought
he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are you afraid
the prince shook his head again repeated the same sounds
my mind my mind aches questioned princess mary
he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this took her hand and
began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
always thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered much more
clearly than he had done before now that he was sure of being
princess mary pressed her head against his hand trying to hide her sobs
i have been calling you all night he brought out
if only i had known she said through her tears i was afraid to
no i did not sleep said princess mary shaking her head
unconsciously imitating her father she now tried to express herself as
he did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to move
dear one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what he
had said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
caressing word such as he had never used to her before why didnt you
and i was wishing for his death thought princess mary
thank you daughter dear for all for all forgive thank
you forgive thank you and tears began to flow from his
eyes call andrew he said suddenly and a childish timid expression
of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke
he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least it
i have a letter from him she replied
he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in answer
to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
remembered everything he nodded his head and reopened his eyes
yes he said softly and distinctly russia has perished theyve
and he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes princess mary
could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face
again he closed his eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes and
then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
understand for a long time till at last tikhon understood and repeated
it princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
which he had just been speaking she thought he was speaking of russia
or prince andrew of herself of his grandson or of his own death and
put on your white dress i like it was what he said
having understood this princess mary sobbed still louder and the doctor
taking her arm led her out to the veranda soothing her and trying to
persuade her to prepare for her journey when she had left the room the
prince again began speaking about his son about the war and about the
emperor angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice and
then he had a second and final stroke
princess mary stayed on the veranda the day had cleared it was hot and
sunny she could understand nothing think of nothing and feel nothing
except passionate love for her father love such as she thought she had
never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden and as
far as the pond along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had
yes i i i wished for his death yes i wanted it to end
quicker i wished to be at peace and what will become of me what
use will peace be when he is no longer here princess mary murmured
pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
when she had completed the tour of the garden which brought her again
to the house she saw mademoiselle bourienne who had remained at
bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it coming toward her with a
stranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district who had
come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
prompt departure princess mary listened without understanding him she
led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with him then
excusing herself she went to the door of the old princes room the
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter
she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
slope by the pond where no one could see her she did not know how long
she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womans
footsteps running along the path she rose and saw dunyasha her maid
who was evidently looking for her and who stopped suddenly as if in
please come princess the prince said dunyasha in a breaking
immediately im coming im coming replied the princess hurriedly
not giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying and trying to
avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house
princess its gods will you must be prepared for everything said
the marshal meeting her at the house door
let me alone its not true she cried angrily to him
the doctor tried to stop her she pushed him aside and ran to her
fathers door why are these people with frightened faces stopping me
i dont want any of them and what are they doing here she thought
she opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
room startled her in the room were her nurse and other women they all
drew back from the bed making way for her he was still lying on the
bed as before but the stern expression of his quiet face made princess
no hes not dead its impossible she told herself and approached
him and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed her lips to
his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force of the
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her no he is
no more he is not but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent mystery and hiding
her face in her hands princess mary sank into the arms of the doctor
in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had been
the prince tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
not stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together the
legs that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in uniform
with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table
heaven only knows who arranged all this and when but it all got done as
if of its own accord toward night candles were burning round his
coffin a pall was spread over it the floor was strewn with sprays of
juniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head and in a
corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms
just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so the
inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
the coffin the marshal the village elder peasant women and all with
fixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old
until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been
absentees and its peasants were of quite a different character from
those of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress and
disposition they were called steppe peasants the old prince used to
approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hills
to help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but he disliked
prince andrews last stay at bogucharovo when he introduced hospitals
and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had not
softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them
the traits of character the old prince called boorishness various
obscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor that
they would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion to
which they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of the
tsars and of an oath to the tsar paul in 1797 in connection with which
it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
stopped it then of peter fedorovichs return to the throne in seven
years time when everything would be made free and so simple that
there would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and his
invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague
notions of antichrist the end of the world and pure freedom
in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the
crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
pleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and
also very few domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of the
peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the
russian people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to
contemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among
others one instance which had occurred some twenty years before was a
movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm rivers
hundreds of peasants among them the bogucharovo folk suddenly began
selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast
as birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these men with their
wives and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none of
them had ever been they set off in caravans bought their freedom one
by one or ran away and drove or walked toward the warm rivers many
of them were punished some sent to siberia many died of cold and
hunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movement
died down of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reason
but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly and
at the same time simply naturally and forcibly now in 1812 to anyone
living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption
alpatych who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old princes
death noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary to
what was happening in the bald hills district where over a radius of
forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages
to be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the steppe region
round bogucharovo were it was rumored in touch with the french
received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did not
migrate he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant
karp who possessed great influence in the village commune and had
recently been away driving a government transport had returned with
news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that the
french did not harm them alpatych also knew that on the previous day
another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo which
was occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general that no
harm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they would
be paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant had
brought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know that
they were false paid to him in advance for hay
more important still alpatych learned that on the morning of the very
day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the
princess luggage from bogucharovo there had been a village meeting at
which it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no time
to waste on the fifteenth the day of the old princes death the
marshal had insisted on princess marys leaving at once as it was
becoming dangerous he had told her that after the sixteenth he could
not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the day the
old prince died the marshal went away promising to return next day for
the funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings that
the french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove his
for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder
dron whom the old prince called by the diminutive dronushka
dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow
big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are
sixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth as
straight and strong at sixty as at thirty
soon after the migration to the warm rivers in which he had taken
part like the rest dron was made village elder and overseer of
bogucharovo and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty
three years the peasants feared him more than they did their master
the masters both the old prince and the young and the steward
respected him and jestingly called him the minister during the whole
time of his service dron had never been drunk or ill never after
sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue
and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money
account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless
cartloads he sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corn
crop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields
alpatych arriving from the devastated bald hills estate sent for his
dron on the day of the princes funeral and told him to have twelve
horses got ready for the princess carriages and eighteen carts for the
things to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants paid
quitrent alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
with this order for there were two hundred and thirty households at
work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do but on hearing the
order dron lowered his eyes and remained silent alpatych named certain
peasants he knew from whom he told him to take the carts
dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting
alpatych named others but they too according to dron had no horses
available some horses were carting for the government others were too
weak and others had died for want of fodder it seemed that no horses
could be had even for the carriages much less for the carting
alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron was a model
village elder so alpatych had not managed the princes estates for
twenty years in vain he was a model steward possessing in the highest
degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt
with having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers did
not express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovo
commune by which the elder had already been carried away but he also
knew that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the commune
must be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfs
he noticed this hesitation in drons look and therefore frowned and
now just listen dronushka said he dont talk nonsense to me his
excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people
away and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order from the
tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar do you
i hear dron answered without lifting his eyes
eh dron it will turn out badly he said shaking his head
the power is in your hands dron rejoined sadly
eh dron drop it alpatych repeated withdrawing his hand from his
bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at drons feet i can see
through you and three yards into the ground under you he continued
gazing at the floor in front of dron
dron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered
you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
homes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for
the princess things and dont go to any meeting yourself do you
yakov alpatych discharge me take the keys from me and discharge me
stop that cried alpatych sternly i see through you and three yards
under you he repeated knowing that his skill in beekeeping his
knowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that he had
been able to retain the old princes favor for twenty years had long
since gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power of
seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards
dron got up and was about to say something but alpatych interrupted
what is it you have got into your heads eh what are you thinking
what am i to do with the people said dron theyre quite beside
told them i dare say said alpatych are they drinking he asked
quite beside themselves yakov alpatych theyve fetched another
well then listen ill go to the police officer and you tell them
so and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready
alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time
and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
that they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive i understand
from dron alpatych contented himself with that though he not only
doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the
and so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided in the
village outside the drink shop another meeting was being held which
decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the
carts should not be provided without saying anything of this to the
princess alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which
had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the
princess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the police
after her fathers funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and
did not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was
asking for orders about their departure this was before his talk with
dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
away and begged to be left in peace
the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward she lay
on the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of the
leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confused
thoughts were centered on one subject the irrevocability of death and
her own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which had
shown itself during her fathers illness she wished to pray but did not
dare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god
she lay for a long time in that position
the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays
shone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco
cushion at which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts
suddenly stopped unconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got up
and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
yes you can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one will
hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let her
someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black
dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed
her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all
their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but
she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle
bourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust were
the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides is
it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she
princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle
bourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was
dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her and
held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle
bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking of
the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her
only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone
and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess
heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle
bourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot
think of yourself but with my love for you i must do so has
alpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked
princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go or
where to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it not
all the same she thought and did not reply
you know chere marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are in
danger are surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move now
if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knows
princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
oh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said
of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatych
did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing
ive spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow
but i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle
bourienne because you will agree chere marie to fall into the hands
of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible
mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not
printed on ordinary russian paper of general rameaus telling people
not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford
them proper protection she handed this to the princess
i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued
and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you
princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifled
from whom did you get this she asked
they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied
princess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and with
a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrews
dunyasha send alpatych or dronushka or somebody to me she said
and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing
mademoiselle bouriennes voice we must go at once at once she said
appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french
if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that i
the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general rameau for
protection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her
shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that
was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they the
french would settle in this house m le general rameau would occupy
prince andrews study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of
bogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor the
soldiers would violate my fathers newly dug grave to steal his crosses
and stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians and
would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow thought princess mary
not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
and her brother for herself she did not care where she remained or what
happened to her but she felt herself the representative of her dead
father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts
and felt their feelings what they would have said and what they would
have done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince andrews
study trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered her
the demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by her fathers
death all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown force
agitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael
ivanovich and now for tikhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the other
maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bouriennes statement was
correct alpatych was not at home he had gone to the police neither
could the architect michael ivanovich who on being sent for came in
with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smile
of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
answer the old prince without expressing views of his own he now
replied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be got from his
answers the old valet tikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore the
stamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princess
marys questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her
at length dron the village elder entered the room and with a deep bow
to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost
princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him
dronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who
always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her dronushka now
since our misfortune she began but could not go on
