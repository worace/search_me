the officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one might
think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
well send number three company again the officer replied hurriedly
and you are you one of the doctors
no ive come on my own answered pierre and he went down the hill
oh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed him
holding his nose as he ran past the men at work
there they are bringing her coming there they are theyll be
here in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officers
soldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road
a church procession was coming up the hill from borodino first along
the dusty road came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with arms
reversed from behind them came the sound of church singing
soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the
they are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of god
the smolensk mother of god another corrected him
the militiamen both those who had been in the village and those who had
been at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to meet the
church procession following the battalion that marched along the dusty
road came priests in their vestments one little old man in a hood with
attendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a large
dark faced icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that had
been brought from smolensk and had since accompanied the army behind
before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked
at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who had
been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
others the chanters relit their censers and service began the hot
rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon
the singing did not sound loud under the open sky an immense crowd of
bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the icon
behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
reserved for them a bald general with a st georges cross on his neck
stood just behind the priests back and without crossing himself he
was evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service which
he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the
patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial
pose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while
looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre
recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look
at them his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious
expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were
all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who were
singing the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily and
mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother of
god and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we all
flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in
all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of
the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back
and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard
the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre
someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
was made for him was approaching the icon
it was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his way
back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre
recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him
with a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout round shouldered body
with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
eye he had lost kutuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into the
crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an
accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and
bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and
the suite despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted
the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers
when the service was over kutuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily
to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to
rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his
white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as
a child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touched
the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then
the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one
another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and
staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him
count peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voice
pierre looked round boris drubetskoy brushing his knees with his hand
he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon
came up to him smiling boris was elegantly dressed with a slightly
martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like
kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder
meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the
shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to
fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and
the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped
some thirty paces from kutuzov talking to boris
he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
this is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the
camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen
will be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to him
but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are
just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night
with me and well arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri
sergeevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house
but i should like to see the right flank they say its very strong
said pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and ride
well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank
yes yes but where is prince bolkonskis regiment can you point it
prince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to him
to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our
left flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice it is
not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll
quite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders his serene
highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but
boris did not finish for at that moment kaysarov kutuzovs adjutant
came up to pierre ah kaysarov said boris addressing him with an
unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the
count it is amazing how his serene highness could so foresee the
yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong
though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff boris
had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had
established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom boris
had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable
in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties kutuzovs
party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris belonged to the
latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov could
so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come
when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even
if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by
bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for
tomorrows action and new men would come to the front so boris was
after kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not
time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon
him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed
animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of
the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of
personal success his mind however was occupied by the different
expression he saw on other faces an expression that spoke not of
personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death
kutuzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered round him
an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went
toward kutuzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it was
how did that fellow get here asked pierre
hes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has
been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again hes been
proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picket
pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov
i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send
me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i shouldnt
but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland
and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his
skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene
yes yes kutuzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and
just then boris with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to
pierres side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner without raising
his voice said to pierre as though continuing an interrupted
the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what
boris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his
serene highness he knew kutuzovs attention would be caught by those
what are you saying about the militia he asked boris
preparing for tomorrow your serene highness for death they have put
ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed his
eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sigh
so you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes its a
pleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers is
she well my quarters are at your service
and as often happens with old people kutuzov began looking about
absent mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do
then evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew
those verses those verses of marins how do they go eh those he
wrote about gerakov lectures for the corps inditing recite them
recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh
kaysarov recited kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
when pierre had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took his hand
i am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of
the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn
tone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to
survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the
misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to
have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me
pierre looked at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him
with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him
boris said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to
pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line
half an hour later kutuzov left for tatarinova and bennigsen and his
suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line
from gorki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when
they had looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed out as
being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new mown hay
lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village of
borodino and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number of
troops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging
this was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known as
the raevski redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no special
attention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable to
him than any other spot on the plain of borodino
they then crossed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers were
dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode
downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
hail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
of the plowed land and reached some fleches  which were still being
at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino
redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where several
horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or
murat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of the
scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted men
bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explaining
the whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each
faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but
was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and
noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him
on the contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quite
from the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a road
winding through a thick low growing birch wood in the middle of the
wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of
the many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only
when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
in the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a half
they came out on a glade where troops of tuchkovs corps were stationed
here at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with
much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military
importance in front of tuchkovs troops was some high ground not
occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying
that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around
unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed
the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they
were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered
the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank
increased pierres doubt of his own capacity to understand military
matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the
position of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and
shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand
how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed
put there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as an
ambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved
the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
on that bright evening of august 25 prince andrew lay leaning on his
elbow in a broken down shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further
end of his regiments encampment through a gap in the broken wall he
could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty year old birches
with their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oats
were standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires
narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
he had done seven years before at austerlitz
he had received and given the orders for next days battle and had
nothing more to do but his thoughts the simplest clearest and
therefore most terrible thoughts would give him no peace he knew that
tomorrows battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part
in and for the first time in his life the possibility of death
presented itself to him not in relation to any worldly matter or with
reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself to
his own soul vividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and
from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and
preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without
shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life
appeared to him like magic lantern pictures at which he had long been
gazing by artificial light through a glass now he suddenly saw those
badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass yes yes
there they are those false images that agitated enraptured and
tormented me said he to himself passing in review the principal
pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
white daylight of his clear perception of death there they are those
rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory
the good of society love of a woman the fatherland itself how
important these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning they
seemed to be filled and it is all so simple pale and crude in the
cold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me the
three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular his
love for a woman his fathers death and the french invasion which had
overrun half russia love that little girl who seemed to me brimming
over with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made romantic plans
of love and happiness with her oh what a boy i was he said aloud
bitterly ah me i believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
faithful to me for the whole year of my absence like the gentle dove in
the fable she was to pine apart from me but it was much simpler
really it was all very simple and horrible
when my father built bald hills he thought the place was his his land
his air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him aside
unconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his path
and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess mary says
it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is not
here and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trial
intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i
shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own
men by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them
did yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heels
and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new
conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others
and about which i shall know nothing i shall not exist
he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with their
motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark to die to be
killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still
and the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smoke
of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed
terrible and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose
quickly went out of the shed and began to walk about
after he had returned voices were heard outside the shed whos that
the red nosed captain timokhin formerly dolokhovs squadron commander
but now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the
shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster
prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come
about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss
them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed
devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something
prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped
over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was
unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general
and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is
as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they
expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the
shed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he felt
i have come simply you know come it interests me said
pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they
stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows moscow and
my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously
yes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them but
missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow
the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently
reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have
tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with
surprise at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk of
moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince
andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre
addressed his remarks chiefly to the good natured battalion commander
so you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrew
yes that is how do you mean said pierre not being a military man
i cant say i have understood it fully but i understand the general
well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said
oh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince
andrew well and what do you think of kutuzovs appointment he
i was very glad of his appointment thats all i know replied prince
and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying
heaven knows what about him what do you think of him
ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers
pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile
we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your
excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at
well to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when
we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
of hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it all
wasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin turned to the prince
but we darent in our regiment two officers were court martialed for
that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became
timokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answer
such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew
why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound one
cant permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
marauding at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might
outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand
this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time
we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in the
men such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for two
days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he
ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing
he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he
thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is
unsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
accurately as every german has to how can i explain well say your
father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
fathers requirements better than you could then its all right to let
him serve but if your father is mortally sick youll send the valet
away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands
and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could
so it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner could
serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger
she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making him
out a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result will
be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make
him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be still
more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german
and they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre
i dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied
a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all
but thats impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter
and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked
yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in
chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not
limited for time and with this difference too that a knight is always
stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while
in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes
weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can
never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended
on arrangements made by the staff i should be there making
arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the
regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us tomorrows
battle will depend and not on those others success never depends
and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers
on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and
prince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at his commander in alarm
and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince
andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from
expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him
a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we lose
the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours
but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and
we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for
there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could
weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till
the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we
shant say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and the
right flank too extended he went on thats all nonsense theres
nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most
diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
our men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is
killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is
that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do
not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own
at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment
affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred
thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight and
the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win and if you
like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at
the top may make we shall win tomorrows battle tomorrow happen what
there now your excellency thats the truth the real truth said
timokhin who would spare himself now the soldiers in my battalion
believe me wouldnt drink their vodka its not the day for that
all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the shed
with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone
pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation
when they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not far
from the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized
wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by
continuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard these
der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug
 the war must be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend that
oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwchen so
kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privat personen in achtung
 oh yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannot
take into account the loss of private individuals
extend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had
ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald
hills thats all the same to him thats what i was saying to you
those german gentlemen wont win the battle tomorrow but will only make
all the mess they can because they have nothing in their german heads
but theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in their hearts the
one thing needed tomorrow that which timokhin has they have yielded up
all europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers and
so you think we shall win tomorrows battle asked pierre
yes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if i
had the power he began again i would not take prisoners why take
prisoners its chivalry the french have destroyed my home and are on
their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me
every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminals
and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they should be executed
since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been
yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all that
day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he now
understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
impending battle all he had seen that day all the significant and
stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up for
him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in
physics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen
and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and as
not take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself would
quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have
played at war thats whats vile we play at magnanimity and all that
stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she
is so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating the
calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of
chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on its
all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805 they humbugged
us and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples houses issue
false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father
and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no
prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have
prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not
moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his
speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few
times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only
when it was worth while going to certain death as now then there would
not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich and
when there was a war like this one it would be war and then the
determination of the troops would be quite different then all these
westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him
into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia
without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to
accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in
that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is
now war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military
but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the
habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war are
spying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a countrys
inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud
and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class
are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance
cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the
highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese
wear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the
they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill
and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services for
having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they
announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the
greater their achievement how does god above look at them and hear
them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah my
friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have
begun to understand too much and it doesnt do for man to taste of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well its not for long he
however youre sleepy and its time for me to sleep go back to
oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened
go go before a battle one must have ones sleep out repeated prince
he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him good bye be
off he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning away
it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the
expression of prince andrews face was angry or tender
for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
him or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i know
that this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki
on re entering the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could
he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on
one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening
in petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling him
how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost
her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the
forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and
constantly interrupted her story to say no i cant im not telling
it right no you dont understand though he encouraged her by saying
that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to
say but natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that
they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced
that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and it
was so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i cant
describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled
now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes i
understood her he thought i not only understood her but it was just
that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soul
that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body it was
that soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily and
suddenly he remembered how his love had ended he did not need anything
of that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he
only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not
deign to unite his fate and i and he is still alive and gay
prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again began
pacing up and down in front of the shed
on august 25 the eve of the battle of borodino m de beausset prefect
of the french emperors palace arrived at napoleons quarters at
valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the latter from
donning his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had brought
for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
compartment of napoleons tent where he began opening the box while
conversing with napoleons aides de camp who surrounded him
fabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to some
the emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back and
now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
him down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle was
sprinkling eau de cologne on the emperors pampered body with an
expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau
de cologne should be sprinkled napoleons short hair was wet and matted
on the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressed
physical satisfaction go on harder go on he muttered to the valet
who was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an aide de camp
who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of
prisoners taken in yesterdays action was standing by the door after
delivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleon
frowning looked at him from under his brows
no prisoners said he repeating the aide de camps words they are
forcing us to exterminate them so much the worse for the russian
army go on harder harder he muttered hunching his back and
all right let monsieur de beausset enter and fabvier too he said
yes sire and the aide de camp disappeared through the door of the
two valets rapidly dressed his majesty and wearing the blue uniform of
the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room
de beaussets hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the
entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise
napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to
him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him
of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at the
other end of europe with but one thought to be worthy of their
emperor and but one fear to fail to please him the result of that
battle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks during
fabviers account as if he had not expected that matters could go
i must make up for that in moscow said napoleon ill see you
later he added and summoned de beausset who by that time had
prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and covered
de beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which only the old
retainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached him
napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear
you have hurried here i am very glad well what is paris saying he
asked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
sire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was
but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this
kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was
pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear
i am very sorry to have made you travel so far said he
sire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow
napoleon smiled and lifting his head absent mindedly glanced to the
right an aide de camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
yes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open
snuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you
will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital
de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel of
which he had not till then been aware
ha whats this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were
with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his
back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the
a present to your majesty from the empress
it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son borne
to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom for
some reason everyone called the king of rome
a very pretty curly headed boy with a look of the christ in the sistine
madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented the
terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter
though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
the so called king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory
apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in
the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful
with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of
his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of
pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be
historical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him
whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the
terrestrial globe to show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest
paternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round
at a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it
before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on
tiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotion
having sat still for a while he touched himself not knowing why the
thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait
rose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the
portrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationed
round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of
rome the son and heir of their adored monarch
and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with
him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the
officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait
vive lempereur vive le roi de rome vive lempereur came those
after breakfast napoleon in de beaussets presence dictated his order of
short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the
proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections it
soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on
you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable
quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at
austerlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk let our remotest posterity
recall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of
you he was in the great battle before moscow
before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who was
so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tent
your majesty is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation to
accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride and
but napoleon nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount when
napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his
take him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
the portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battle
de beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply to
indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperors words
on the twenty fifth of august so his historians tell us napoleon spent
the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering plans
submitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to his
the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had been
dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the twenty
fourth and part of the line the left flank had been drawn back that
part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was
more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone military
or not that it was here the french should attack it would seem that
not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any
particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals
nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius
