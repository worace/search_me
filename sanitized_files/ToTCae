it was a profounder remark than mr lorry had looked for true said
he and fearful to reflect upon yet a doubt lurks in my mind miss
pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence
cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head touch that
string and he instantly changes for the worse better leave it alone
in short must leave it alone like or no like sometimes he gets up in
the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking
up and down walking up and down in his room ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down walking up and down in
his old prison she hurries to him and they go on together walking up
and down walking up and down until he is composed but he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him in silence they go walking up and down
together walking up and down together till her love and company have
notwithstanding miss prosss denial of her own imagination there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea
in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to
the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
here they are said miss pross rising to break up the conference
and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon
it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such a
peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorry stood at the open window
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied
they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though
the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them
miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking
off her darlings bonnet when she came up stairs and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and
folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant
sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do
playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own
chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at
them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would
have had more if it were possible mr lorry was a pleasant sight too
beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no
hundreds of people came to see the sights and mr lorry looked in vain
dinner time and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of
the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and
always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest
quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their
contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be
better miss prosss friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of
impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would
impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress
or cinderellas godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit
a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she
on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower
regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance on this occasion
miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too
it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane tree and they should sit
there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her
they went out under the plane tree and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of mr lorry she had installed herself some
time before as mr lorrys cup bearer and while they sat under the
plane tree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the plane tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads
still the hundreds of people did not present themselves mr darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree but he
doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie but miss pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and
retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the
the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the
resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as
they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the
he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual
vivacity pray doctor manette said mr darnay as they sat under the
plane tree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand
which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of
lucie and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of
it to know that it teems with interest little more
i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smile
though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a
in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which
had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to
execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with
some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand
at first they were read as d i c but on being more carefully
examined the last letter was found to be g there was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested
that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the
earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found
the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he
had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler
he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and
no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they
made me start we had better go in
he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large
drops and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it but he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of and as they went into the house the business eye of mr lorry
either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned
towards charles darnay the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house
he recovered himself so quickly however that mr lorry had doubts of
his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and
tea time and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerks upon
her and yet no hundreds of people mr carton had lounged in but he
the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and
windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was
done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the
heavy twilight lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton
leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of
the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the
the rain drops are still falling large heavy and few said doctor
they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a
dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do
there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a
a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay when they had
is it not impressive mr darnay asked lucie sometimes i have
sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night when all is so black and
let us shudder too we may know what it is
it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we
originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so
sydney carton struck in in his moody way
the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some
as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some
coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in
the distant streets and not one within sight
are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us miss manette or
i dont know mr darnay i told you it was a foolish fancy but you
asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and
then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
i take them into mine said carton i ask no questions and make no
stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us miss manette
and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window
and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they
it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him
for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moments
interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at
the great bell of saint pauls was striking one in the cleared air when
mr lorry escorted by jerry high booted and bearing a lantern set
forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches
of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mr lorry mindful
of foot pads always retained jerry for this service though it was
what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr lorry to
i never see the night myself master nor yet i dont expect to what
good night mr carton said the man of business good night mr
darnay shall we ever see such a night again together
perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar
monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was in
his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing france but his mornings chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four
yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the
chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to
conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneurs lips one lacquey carried
the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function
a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold
watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy
and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so
impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance
for france as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted
days of the merry stuart who sold it
monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which
was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public
business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and
particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world
was made for them the text of his order altered from the original
by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness
yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of
affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances
public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances
private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after
generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence
monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could
wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general
poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer
rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked
a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his
stables twenty four male domestics sat in his halls six body women
waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day
for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not
so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost
equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have
been anybodys business at the house of monseigneur military officers
destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship
civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the
worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives
all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of
monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the
score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were
no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving
philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making
card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving
chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been
since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies
among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half
of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and
appearance owned to being a mother indeed except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing
known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close
and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting
them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the
spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the
future for monseigneurs guidance besides these dervishes were other
three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a
jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the
centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got
out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre
by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much
discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never
but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of
monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally
correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant
swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would
surely keep anything going for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells
and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and
dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that
was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through
monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals
of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball
descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was
required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps
and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a
rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call
him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at
monseigneurs reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would
monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown
open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and
fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in
body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never
bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of
truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon
but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm
and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his
i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil
with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs
he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and
with a face like a fine mask a face of a transparent paleness every
feature in it clearly defined one set expression on it the nose
beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril in those two compressions or dints the only little
change that the face ever showed resided they persisted in changing
colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation then they gave a look of
treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance examined with
attention its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of the eyes being much
too horizontal and thin still in the effect of the face made it was a
its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and
drove away not many people had talked with him at the reception he had
stood in a little space apart and monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner it appeared under the circumstances rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses and
often barely escaping from being run down his man drove as if he were
charging an enemy and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face or to the lips of the master the complaint had
sometimes made itself audible even in that deaf city and dumb age
that in the narrow streets without footways the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner but few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time and in this matter as in all others the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could
with a wild rattle and clatter and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners with women screaming
before it and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices and the horses reared and plunged
but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would not have
stopped carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded
behind and why not but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry
and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles
what has gone wrong said monsieur calmly looking out
a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountain and was
down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal
pardon monsieur the marquis said a ragged and submissive man it is
why does he make that abominable noise is it his child
excuse me monsieur the marquis it is a pity yes
the fountain was a little removed for the street opened where it was
into a space some ten or twelve yards square as the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground and came running at the carriage monsieur the
marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt
killed shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both arms at
their length above his head and staring at him dead
the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis there was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness there was no visible menacing or anger neither did the
people say anything after the first cry they had been silent and they
remained so the voice of the submissive man who had spoken was flat
and tame in its extreme submission monsieur the marquis ran his eyes
over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes
it is extraordinary to me said he that you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is for ever in
the way how do i know what injury you have done my horses see give
he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell the
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry dead
he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom the rest
made way on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder
sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it they
i know all i know all said the last comer be a brave man my
gaspard it is better for the poor little plaything to die so than to
live it has died in a moment without pain could it have lived an hour
you are a philosopher you there said the marquis smiling how do
pick up that philosopher and vendor of wine said the marquis
throwing him another gold coin and spend it as you will the horses
without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time monsieur the
marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing and had
paid for it and could afford to pay for it when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor
hold said monsieur the marquis hold the horses who threw that
he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood a
moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the
you dogs said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchanged front
except as to the spots on his nose i would ride over any of you very
willingly and exterminate you from the earth if i knew which rascal
threw at the carriage and if that brigand were sufficiently near it he
so cowed was their condition and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them within the law and beyond it that not
a voice or a hand or even an eye was raised among the men not one
but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the
marquis in the face it was not for his dignity to notice it his
contemptuous eyes passed over her and over all the other rats and he
leaned back in his seat again and gave the word go on
he was driven on and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession the minister the state projector the farmer general the
doctor the lawyer the ecclesiastic the grand opera the comedy the
whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow came whirling by the rats
had crept out of their holes to look on and they remained looking
on for hours soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk and through
which they peeped the father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous knitting still knitted on with the steadfastness
of fate the water of the fountain ran the swift river ran the day ran
into evening so much life in the city ran into death according to rule
time and tide waited for no man the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again the fancy ball was lighted up at supper all
a beautiful landscape with the corn bright in it but not abundant
patches of poor rye where corn should have been patches of poor peas
and beans patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat on
inanimate nature as on the men and women who cultivated it a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly a dejected
monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been
lighter conducted by four post horses and two postilions fagged up
a steep hill a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control the setting
the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill top that its occupant was steeped in crimson it will
die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly
in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down
hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed
quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow
but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village
at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a
church tower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was
the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor
tannery poor tavern poor stable yard for relays of post horses poor
fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all
its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors
shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the
fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor
were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax
for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be
paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until
the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed
few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill
or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag
heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions
whips which twined snake like about their heads in the evening air as
if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting house gate it was hard by the
fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him
he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow
sure filing down of misery worn face and figure that was to make the
meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years
monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him as the like of himself had drooped before
monseigneur of the court only the difference was that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate when a grizzled mender
bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier
the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain
monseigneur it is true i had the honour of being passed on the road
coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both
he stooped a little and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage
pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoe the drag
may the devil carry away these idiots how do you call the man you
know all the men of this part of the country who was he
your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the country of
all the days of my life i never saw him
with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur
he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his
face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down then recovered
himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow
monseigneur he was whiter than the miller all covered with dust
white as a spectre tall as a spectre
the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd but all
eyes without comparing notes with other eyes looked at monsieur
the marquis perhaps to observe whether he had any spectre on his
truly you did well said the marquis felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him to see a thief accompanying my carriage
and not open that great mouth of yours bah put him aside monsieur
monsieur gabelle was the postmaster and some other taxing functionary
united he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to night and be sure that his business is honest gabelle
monseigneur i am flattered to devote myself to your orders
did he run away fellow where is that accursed
the accursed was already under the carriage with some half dozen
particular friends pointing out the chain with his blue cap some
half dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out and
did the man run away dolt when we stopped for the drag
monseigneur he precipitated himself over the hill side head first as
the half dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or
the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond was soon checked by the steepness of the hill gradually
it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips the valet walked by the horses the
courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dull distance
at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground
with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor
figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had
studied the figure from the life his own life maybe for it was
to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she
turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and
with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face
monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester
what of your husband the forester always the same with you people he
he has paid all monseigneur he is dead
well he is quiet can i restore him to you
alas no monseigneur but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor
monseigneur there are so many little heaps of poor grass
she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate
grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriage door tenderly
caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to
monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of
want so many die of want so many more will die of want
monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition is
that a morsel of stone or wood with my husbands name may be placed
over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will be quickly
forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady i
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass monseigneur they
are so many they increase so fast there is so much want monseigneur
the valet had put her away from the door the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left far
behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him and rose as
the rain falls impartially on the dusty ragged and toil worn group
at the fountain not far away to whom the mender of roads with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre as long as they could bear it by degrees as they
could bear no more they dropped off one by one and lights twinkled
in little casements which lights as the casements darkened and more
stars came out seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
the shadow of a large high roofed house and of many over hanging trees
was upon monsieur the marquis by that time and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau as his carriage stopped and the great door
monsieur charles whom i expect is he arrived from england
it was a heavy mass of building that chateau of monsieur the marquis
with a large stone courtyard before it and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door a stony
business altogether with heavy stone balustrades and stone urns and
stone flowers and stone faces of men and stone heads of lions in
all directions as if the gorgons head had surveyed it when it was
up the broad flight of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeau
preceded went from his carriage sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees all else was so quiet that the
flambeau carried up the steps and the other flambeau held at the great
door burnt as if they were in a close room of state instead of being
in the open night air other sound than the owls voice there was none
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin for it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together and then
heave a long low sigh and hold their breath again
the great door clanged behind him and monsieur the marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar spears swords and knives of the chase
grimmer with certain heavy riding rods and riding whips of which many a
peasant gone to his benefactor death had felt the weight when his lord
avoiding the larger rooms which were dark and made fast for the night
monsieur the marquis with his flambeau bearer going on before went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor this thrown open admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms his bed chamber and two
others high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country
the fashion of the last louis but one of the line that was never to
break the fourteenth louis was conspicuous in their rich furniture
but it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
a supper table was laid for two in the third of the rooms a round
room in one of the chateaus four extinguisher topped towers a small
lofty room with its window wide open and the wooden jalousie blinds
closed so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black alternating with their broad lines of stone colour
my nephew said the marquis glancing at the supper preparation they
nor was he but he had been expected with monseigneur
ah it is not probable he will arrive to night nevertheless leave the
table as it is i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour
in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper his chair was opposite to the window and
he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his
what is that he calmly asked looking with attention at the
monseigneur it is nothing the trees and the night are all that are
the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked out into
the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind him looking round
good said the imperturbable master close them again
that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper he was
half way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand
hearing the sound of wheels it came on briskly and came up to the
it was the nephew of monseigneur he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur early in the afternoon he had diminished the distance
rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road
he had heard of monseigneur at the posting houses as being before him
he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and
there and that he was prayed to come to it in a little while he came
he had been known in england as charles darnay
monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shake
you left paris yesterday sir he said to monseigneur as he took his
you have been a long time coming said the marquis with a smile
pardon me i mean not a long time on the journey a long time
i have been detained by the nephew stopped a moment in his
so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them
when coffee had been served and they were alone together the nephew
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that
took me away it carried me into great and unexpected peril but it is
a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have
not to death said the uncle it is not necessary to say to death
i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there
the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly a slight form of good
indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
but however that may be resumed the nephew glancing at him with
deep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means
and would know no scruple as to means
my friend i told you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation in the
two marks do me the favour to recall that i told you so long ago
