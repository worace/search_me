hat he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented
the first thing that struck the observer was that this personages
coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made
there was in paris at that epoch in a low lived old lodging in the rue
beautreillis near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was
to change villains into honest men not for too long which might have
proved embarrassing for the villain the change was on sight for a day
or two at the rate of thirty sous a day by means of a costume which
resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible
this costumer was called the changer the pickpockets of paris
had given him this name and knew him by no other he had a tolerably
complete wardrobe the rags with which he tricked out people were almost
probable he had specialties and categories on each nail of his
shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a
magistrate there the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker
in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere
the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a
this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays
in paris his lair was the green room whence theft emerged and into
which roguery retreated a tattered knave arrived at this dressing room
deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which
he wished to play the costume which suited him and on descending the
stairs once more the knave was a somebody on the following day the
clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the
thieves with everything was never robbed there was one inconvenience
about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those
who wore them they were too tight for one too loose for another and
did not adjust themselves to any one every pickpocket who exceeded or
fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the changers
costumes it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or
too lean the changer had foreseen only ordinary men he had taken the
measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is
neither stout nor thin neither tall nor short hence adaptations which
were sometimes difficult and from which the changers clients extricated
themselves as best they might so much the worse for the exceptions
the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and
consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small
for castelcicala the costume of a statesman was designated as follows
a coat of black cloth trowsers of black wool a silk waistcoat boots
and linen on the margin there stood ex ambassador and a note
which we also copy in a separate box a neatly frizzed peruke green
glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton
all this belonged to the statesman the ex ambassador this whole
costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were
white a vague button hole yawned at one of the elbows moreover one of
the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as
the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid
upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button
if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he
would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom
basque had just shown in the statesmans suit borrowed from the
pick me down that shop of the changer
marius disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he
expected to see turned to the newcomers disadvantage
he surveyed him from head to foot while that personage made exaggerated
the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a
it seems to me impossible that i should not have already had the honor
of seeing monsieur le baron in society i think i actually did meet
monsieur personally several years ago at the house of madame la
princesse bagration and in the drawing rooms of his lordship the vicomte
it is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize
marius paid attention to the manner of this mans speech he spied
on his accent and gesture but his disappointment increased the
pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry shrill tone which
i know neither madame bagration nor m dambray said he i have never
set foot in the house of either of them in my life
the reply was ungracious the personage determined to be gracious at
then it must have been at chateaubriands that i have seen monsieur i
know chateaubriand very well he is very affable he sometimes says to
me thenard my friend    wont you drink a glass of wine with me
i have never had the honor of being received by m de chateaubriand
let us cut it short what do you want
the man bowed lower at that harsh voice
monsieur le baron deign to listen to me there is in america in a
district near panama a village called la joya that village is composed
of a single house a large square house of three stories built of
bricks dried in the sun each side of the square five hundred feet in
length each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below in
such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit
of the edifice in the centre an inner court where the provisions and
munitions are kept no windows loopholes no doors ladders ladders
to mount from the ground to the first terrace and from the first to the
second and from the second to the third ladders to descend into the
inner court no doors to the chambers trap doors no staircases to the
chambers ladders in the evening the traps are closed the ladders
are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes
no means of entering a house by day a citadel by night eight hundred
inhabitants that is the village why so many precautions because the
country is dangerous it is full of cannibals then why do people go
there because the country is marvellous gold is found there
what are you driving at interrupted marius who had passed from
at this monsieur le baron i am an old and weary diplomat ancient
civilization has thrown me on my own devices i want to try savages
monsieur le baron egotism is the law of the world the proletarian
peasant woman who toils by the day turns round when the diligence
passes by the peasant proprietress who toils in her field does not
turn round the dog of the poor man barks at the rich man the dog
of the rich man barks at the poor man each one for himself
self interest thats the object of men gold thats the loadstone
i should like to go and establish myself at la joya there are three
of us i have my spouse and my young lady a very beautiful girl the
journey is long and costly i need a little money
what concern is that of mine demanded marius
the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat a gesture
characteristic of the vulture and replied with an augmented smile
has not monsieur le baron perused my letter
there was some truth in this the fact is that the contents of the
epistle had slipped marius mind he had seen the writing rather than
read the letter he could hardly recall it but a moment ago a fresh
start had been given him he had noted that detail my spouse and my
he fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger an examining judge could
not have done the look better he almost lay in wait for him
the stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs drew himself up
without straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his
turn with the green gaze of his spectacles
so be it monsieur le baron i will be precise i have a secret to sell
marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him
i commence gratis said the stranger you will see that i am
monsieur le baron you have in your house a thief and an assassin
the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on
an assassin and a thief remark monsieur le baron that i do not here
speak of ancient deeds deeds of the past which have lapsed which can
be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god
i speak of recent deeds of actual facts as still unknown to justice
at this hour i continue this man has insinuated himself into your
confidence and almost into your family under a false name i am about
to tell you his real name and to tell it to you for nothing
i am going to tell you equally for nothing who he is
you know it since i have had the honor of telling you
marius cold tone that double reply of i know it his laconicism
which was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath
in the stranger he launched a furious glance on the sly at marius
which was instantly extinguished rapid as it was this glance was of
the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it it did not
escape marius certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls
the eye that vent hole of the thought glows with it spectacles hide
nothing try putting a pane of glass over hell
i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron in any case
you ought to perceive that i am well informed now what i have to tell
you is known to myself alone this concerns the fortune of madame la
baronne it is an extraordinary secret it is for sale i make you the
first offer of it cheap twenty thousand francs
i know that secret as well as the others said marius
the personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle
monsieur le baron say ten thousand francs and i will speak
i repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me i know
a fresh flash gleamed in the mans eye he exclaimed
but i must dine to day nevertheless it is an extraordinary secret
i tell you monsieur le baron i will speak i speak give me twenty
i know your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean valjeans name
that is not difficult monsieur le baron i had the honor to write to
you and to tell it to you thenard
in danger the porcupine bristles up the beetle feigns death the old
guard forms in a square this man burst into laughter
then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a
you are also jondrette the workman fabantou the comedian genflot the
poet don alvares the spaniard and mistress balizard
and you kept a pot house at montfermeil
and i tell you that your name is thenardier
and marius drew a bank note from his pocket and flung it in his face
thanks pardon me five hundred francs monsieur le baron
and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it
five hundred francs he began again taken aback and he stammered in
well so be it he exclaimed let us put ourselves at our ease
and with the agility of a monkey flinging back his hair tearing off
his spectacles and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two
quills of which mention was recently made and which the reader has also
met with on another page of this book he took off his face as the man
his eye lighted up his uneven brow with hollows in some places and
bumps in others hideously wrinkled at the top was laid bare his nose
had become as sharp as a beak the fierce and sagacious profile of the
monsieur le baron is infallible he said in a clear voice whence all
thenardier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have
been troubled had he been capable of such a thing he had come to bring
astonishment and it was he who had received it this humiliation had
been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he
accepted it but he was none the less bewildered
he beheld this baron pontmercy for the first time and in spite of
his disguise this baron pontmercy recognized him and recognized
him thoroughly and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to
thenardier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean who was this
almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew
peoples names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to
them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe
thenardier the reader will remember although he had been marius
neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had
formerly in a vague way heard his daughters talk of a very poor young
man named marius who lived in the house he had written to him without
knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted
no connection between that marius and m le baron pontmercy was possible
as for the name pontmercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield
of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he
always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely
however through his daughter azelma who had started on the scent of
the married pair on the 16th of february and through his own personal
researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the
depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one
mysterious clew he had discovered by dint of industry or at least
by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had
encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer from the man he had
easily reached the name he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was
cosette but he meant to be discreet in that quarter
who was cosette he did not know exactly himself he did indeed catch
an inkling of illegitimacy the history of fantine had always seemed to
him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that in order to
cause himself to be paid for his silence he had or thought he had
better wares than that for sale and according to all appearances if
he were to come and make to the baron pontmercy this revelation and
without proof your wife is a bastard the only result would be to
attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer
from thenardiers point of view the conversation with marius had not
yet begun he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy
to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing
essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs
in his pocket moreover he had something decisive to say and even
against this very well informed and well armed baron pontmercy he felt
himself strong for men of thenardiers nature every dialogue is
a combat in the one in which he was about to engage what was his
situation he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of
what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and
after having said i am thenardier he waited
marius had become thoughtful so he had hold of thenardier at last
that man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him he could
he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this
villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb
by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day it
also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards thenardier
that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of
having been saved by such a rascal in any case he was content he
was about to deliver the colonels shade from this unworthy creditor
at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his
fathers memory from the debtors prison by the side of this duty there
was another to elucidate if possible the source of cosettes fortune
the opportunity appeared to present itself perhaps thenardier knew
something it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man
thenardier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and
was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender
thenardier i have told you your name now would you like to have me
tell you your secret the one that you came here to reveal to me i have
information of my own also you shall see that i know more about it
than you do jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief
a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought
about an assassin because he assassinated police agent javert
i will make myself intelligible in a certain arrondissement of the pas
de calais there was in 1822 a man who had fallen out with justice
and who under the name of m madeleine had regained his status and
rehabilitated himself this man had become a just man in the full force
of the term in a trade the manufacture of black glass goods he
made the fortune of an entire city as far as his personal fortune was
concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some
sort by accident he was the foster father of the poor he founded
hospitals opened schools visited the sick dowered young girls
supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of
the country he refused the cross he was appointed mayor a liberated
convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former
days he denounced him and had him arrested and profited by the arrest
to come to paris and cause the banker laffitte i have the fact from
the cashier himself by means of a false signature to hand over to
him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m madeleine this
convict who robbed m madeleine was jean valjean as for the other fact
you have nothing to tell me about it either jean valjean killed the
agent javert he shot him with a pistol i the person who is speaking
thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who
lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in
one instant all the ground which he has lost but the smile returned
instantly the inferiors triumph in the presence of his superior must
monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track
and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an
what broke forth marius do you dispute that these are facts
they are chimeras the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors
me renders it my duty to tell him so truth and justice before all
things i do not like to see folks accused unjustly monsieur le baron
jean valjean did not rob m madeleine and jean valjean did not kill
this is the first he did not rob m madeleine because it is jean
and this is the second he did not assassinate javert because the
prove it prove it cried marius beside himself
thenardier resumed scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient
police agent ja vert was found drowned un der a boat of the pont au change
thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper which
seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes
monsieur le baron in your interests i desired to know jean valjean
thoroughly i say that jean valjean and m madeleine are one and the
same man and i say that javert had no other assassin than javert if
i speak it is because i have proofs not manuscript proofs writing is
as he spoke thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of
newspapers yellow faded and strongly saturated with tobacco one of
these two newspapers broken at every fold and falling into rags seemed
two facts two proofs remarked thenardier and he offered the two
the reader is acquainted with these two papers one the most ancient a
number of the drapeau blanc of the 25th of july 1823 the text of
which can be seen in the first volume established the identity of m
the other a moniteur of the 15th of june 1832 announced the suicide
of javert adding that it appeared from a verbal report of javert to the
prefect that having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the rue de
la chanvrerie he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent
who holding him under his pistol had fired into the air instead of
marius read he had evidence a certain date irrefragable proof these
two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing
up thenardiers statements the note printed in the moniteur had been an
administrative communication from the prefecture of police marius could
the information of the cashier clerk had been false and he himself had
jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud
marius could not repress a cry of joy
well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man the whole of that
fortune really belonged to him he is madeleine the providence of a
whole countryside he is jean valjean javerts savior he is a hero he
hes not a saint and hes not a hero said thenardier hes an
and he added in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses
robber assassin those words which marius thought had disappeared and
which returned fell upon him like an ice cold shower bath
always ejaculated thenardier jean valjean did not rob madeleine
but he is a thief he did not kill javert but he is a murderer
will you speak retorted marius of that miserable theft committed
forty years ago and expiated as your own newspapers prove by a whole
life of repentance of self abnegation and of virtue
i say assassination and theft monsieur le baron and i repeat that i
am speaking of actual facts what i have to reveal to you is absolutely
unknown it belongs to unpublished matter and perhaps you will find in
it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to madame la baronne
by jean valjean i say skilfully because by a gift of that nature it
would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose
comforts one would then share and at the same stroke to conceal ones
crime and to enjoy ones theft to bury ones name and to create for
i might interrupt you at this point said marius but go on
monsieur le baron i will tell you all leaving the recompense to your
generosity this secret is worth massive gold you will say to me why
do not you apply to jean valjean for a very simple reason i know
that he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and i
consider the combination ingenious but he has no longer a son he would
show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for
my trip to la joya i prefer you you who have it all to him who has
nothing i am a little fatigued permit me to take a chair
marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same
thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair picked up his two
newspapers thrust them back into their envelope and murmured as he
pecked at the drapeau blanc with his nail it cost me a good deal of
that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of
the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what
they are saying then he entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing
monsieur le baron on the 6th of june 1832 about a year ago on the
day of the insurrection a man was in the grand sewer of paris at the
point where the sewer enters the seine between the pont des invalides
marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of thenardier thenardier
noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator
who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under
this man forced to conceal himself and for reasons moreover which
are foreign to politics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had
a key to it it was i repeat on the 6th of june it might have been
eight oclock in the evening the man hears a noise in the sewer
greatly surprised he hides himself and lies in wait it was the sound
of footsteps some one was walking in the dark and coming in his
direction strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides
himself the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off
a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the
newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back
he was walking in a bent attitude the man who was walking in a bent
attitude was an ex convict and what he was dragging on his shoulders
was a corpse assassination caught in the very act if ever there was
such a thing as for the theft that is understood one does not kill
a man gratis this convict was on his way to fling the body into the
river one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit
grating this convict who had come a long distance in the sewer must
necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as
though he might have left the body but the sewermen would have found
the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire
and that did not suit the assassins plans he had preferred to
traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been
terrible for it is impossible to risk ones life more completely i
dont understand how he could have come out of that alive
marius chair approached still nearer thenardier took advantage of this
to draw a long breath he went on
monsieur le baron a sewer is not the champ de mars one lacks
everything there even room when two men are there they must meet
that is what happened the man domiciled there and the passer by were
forced to bid each other good day greatly to the regret of both the
passer by said to the inhabitant you see what i have on my back i
must get out you have the key give it to me that convict was a man
of terrible strength there was no way of refusing nevertheless the
man who had the key parleyed simply to gain time he examined the dead
man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well
dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood
while talking the man contrived to tear and pull off behind without
the assassin perceiving it a bit of the assassinated mans coat a
document for conviction you understand a means of recovering the trace
of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal he put
this document for conviction in his pocket after which he opened the
grating made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed
the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the
remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present
when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river now you
comprehend the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the
one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of
thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding
on a level with his eyes nipped between his two thumbs and his two
forefingers a strip of torn black cloth all covered with dark spots
marius had sprung to his feet pale hardly able to draw his breath
with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without
uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment he
retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for
a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney
he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without
looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which
monsieur le baron i have the strongest of reasons for believing that
the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by
jean valjean and the bearer of an enormous sum of money
the young man was myself and here is the coat cried marius and he
flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood
then snatching the fragment from the hands of thenardier he crouched
down over the coat and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt
the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the coat
this is what he thought im struck all of a heap
marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant
he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to thenardier presenting
to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank notes
you are an infamous wretch you are a liar a calumniator a villain
you came to accuse that man you have only justified him you wanted to
ruin him you have only succeeded in glorifying him and it is you who
are the thief and it is you who are the assassin i saw you thenardier
jondrette in that lair on the rue de lhopital i know enough about
you to send you to the galleys and even further if i choose here are a
and he flung a thousand franc note at thenardier
ah jondrette thenardier vile rascal let this serve you as a lesson
you dealer in second hand secrets merchant of mysteries rummager of
the shadows wretch take these five hundred francs and get out of here
waterloo growled thenardier pocketing the five hundred francs along
yes assassin you there saved the life of a colonel  
of a general said thenardier elevating his head
of a colonel repeated marius in a rage i wouldnt give a hapenny
for a general and you come here to commit infamies i tell you that
you have committed all crimes go disappear only be happy that is all
that i desire ah monster here are three thousand francs more take
them you will depart to morrow for america with your daughter
for your wife is dead you abominable liar i shall watch over your
departure you ruffian and at that moment i will count out to you
twenty thousand francs go get yourself hung elsewhere
monsieur le baron replied thenardier bowing to the very earth
eternal gratitude and thenardier left the room understanding
nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks
of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in
struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would
have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such
let us finish with this man at once
two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating he set
out thanks to marius care for america under a false name with his
daughter azelma furnished with a draft on new york for twenty thousand
the moral wretchedness of thenardier the bourgeois who had missed
his vocation was irremediable he was in america what he had been in
europe contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good
action and to cause evil things to spring from it with marius money
as soon as thenardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden
cosette cosette he cried come come quick let us go basque a
carriage cosette come ah my god it was he who saved my life let us
not lose a minute put on your shawl
he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its
throbbing he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced
ah cosette i am an unhappy wretch said he
marius was bewildered he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of
some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure an unheard of virtue
supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him the convict
marius was dazzled by this prodigy he did not know precisely what he
in an instant a hackney carriage stood in front of the door
marius helped cosette in and darted in himself
driver said he rue de lhomme arme number 7
ah what happiness ejaculated cosette rue de lhomme arme i did
not dare to speak to you of that we are going to see m jean
thy father cosette thy father more than ever cosette i guess it
you told me that you had never received the letter that i sent you by
gavroche it must have fallen into his hands cosette he went to the
barricade to save me as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he
saved others also he saved javert he rescued me from that gulf to give
me to you he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer ah i
am a monster of ingratitude cosette after having been your providence
he became mine just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to
drown one a hundred times over to drown one in mire cosette he made
me traverse it i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i
could know nothing of my own adventure we are going to bring him back
to take him with us whether he is willing or not he shall never leave
us again if only he is at home provided only that we can find him
i will pass the rest of my life in venerating him yes that is how it
should be do you see cosette gavroche must have delivered my letter
chapter v a night behind which there is day
jean valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door
marius remained on the threshold leaning against the jamb of the door
and he sat erect in his chair his arms outstretched and trembling
haggard livid gloomy an immense joy in his eyes
cosette stifling with emotion fell upon jean valjeans breast
cosette she you madame it is thou ah my god
and pressed close in cosettes arms he exclaimed
it is thou thou art here thou dost pardon me then
marius lowering his eyelids in order to keep his tears from flowing
took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to
and you also you pardon me jean valjean said to him
marius could find no words and jean valjean added
cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed
and seating herself on the old mans knees she put aside his white
locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow
jean valjean bewildered let her have her own way
cosette who only understood in a very confused manner redoubled her
caresses as though she desired to pay marius debt
how stupid people are i thought that i should never see her again
imagine monsieur pontmercy at the very moment when you entered i
was saying to myself all is over here is her little gown i am a
miserable man i shall never see cosette again and i was saying that
at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs was not i an
idiot just see how idiotic one can be one reckons without the good
you fancy that you are about to be abandoned stupid no no things
will not go so come there is a good man yonder who is in need of an
angel and the angel comes and one sees ones cosette again and one
sees ones little cosette once more ah i was very unhappy
for a moment he could not speak then he went on
i really needed to see cosette a little bit now and then a heart needs
a bone to gnaw but i was perfectly conscious that i was in the way i
gave myself reasons they do not want you keep in your own course
one has not the right to cling eternally ah god be praised i see her
once more dost thou know cosette thy husband is very handsome ah
what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on luckily i am fond of
that pattern it was thy husband who chose it was it not and then
thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls let me call her thou monsieur
how wicked of you to have left us like that where did you go why have
you stayed away so long formerly your journeys only lasted three or
four days i sent nicolette the answer always was he is absent how
long have you been back why did you not let us know do you know that
you are very much changed ah what a naughty father he has been ill
and we have not known it stay marius feel how cold his hand is
so you are here monsieur pontmercy you pardon me repeated jean
at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more all that was
cosette do you hear he has come to that he asks my forgiveness and
do you know what he has done for me cosette he has saved my life he
has done more he has given you to me and after having saved me and
after having given you to me cosette what has he done with himself he
has sacrificed himself behold the man and he says to me the ingrate
to me the forgetful to me the pitiless to me the guilty one thanks
cosette my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too
little that barricade that sewer that furnace that cesspool all
that he traversed for me for thee cosette he carried me away through
all the deaths which he put aside before me and accepted for himself

hush hush said jean valjean in a low voice why tell all that
but you cried marius with a wrath in which there was veneration why

not tell you were monsieur madeleine why not have said so you saved
javert why not have said so i owed my life to you why not have said
because i thought as you do i thought that you were in the right it
was necessary that i should go away if you had known about that affair
