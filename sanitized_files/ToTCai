covered up their tracks with a determination so strong that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep a more remarkable face in its quiet
resolute and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep that night
she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be and as his
sorrows deserved then she withdrew her hand and kissed his lips once
more and went away so the sunrise came and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane tree moved upon his face as softly as her lips had moved
the marriage day was shining brightly and they were ready outside the
closed door of the doctors room where he was speaking with charles
darnay they were ready to go to church the beautiful bride mr
lorry and miss pross to whom the event through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable would have been one of absolute bliss
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should
and so said mr lorry who could not sufficiently admire the bride
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet
pretty dress and so it was for this my sweet lucie that i brought
you across the channel such a baby lord bless me how little i thought
what i was doing how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring
you didnt mean it remarked the matter of fact miss pross and
really well but dont cry said the gentle mr lorry
i am not crying said miss pross you are
i my pross by this time mr lorry dared to be pleasant with her
you were just now i saw you do it and i dont wonder at it such
a present of plate as you have made em is enough to bring tears into
anybodys eyes theres not a fork or a spoon in the collection said
miss pross that i didnt cry over last night after the box came till
i am highly gratified said mr lorry though upon my honour i
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one dear me this is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost dear dear dear to think that there
might have been a mrs lorry any time these fifty years almost
you think there never might have been a mrs lorry asked the
pooh rejoined miss pross you were a bachelor in your cradle
well observed mr lorry beamingly adjusting his little wig that
and you were cut out for a bachelor pursued miss pross before you
then i think said mr lorry that i was very unhandsomely dealt
with and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern enough now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist i hear them moving in the next room and miss pross and
i as two formal folks of business are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear you leave
your good father my dear in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own he shall be taken every conceivable care of during the next
fortnight while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts even tellsons
shall go to the wall comparatively speaking before him and when at
the fortnights end he comes to join you and your beloved husband on
your other fortnights trip in wales you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame now i hear
somebodys step coming to the door let me kiss my dear girl with an
old fashioned bachelor blessing before somebody comes to claim his
for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at the
well remembered expression on the forehead and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which if such things be old fashioned were as old as adam
the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles
darnay he was so deadly pale which had not been the case when they
went in together that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face
but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered except that to the
shrewd glance of mr lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him like a cold
he gave his arm to his daughter and took her down stairs to the chariot
which mr lorry had hired in honour of the day the rest followed in
another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange
eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married
besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling
glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of mr lorrys pockets they returned home to
breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the
it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father
cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms take her charles she is yours
and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was
the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the
preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorry
and miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted
he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was
the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up stairs mr lorry was reminded of defarge the
i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i
think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him
i must look in at tellsons so i will go there at once and come back
presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine
it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tellsons than to look out of
tellsons he was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the
old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus
into the doctors rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking
good god he said with a start whats that
miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear o me o me all is
lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird
he doesnt know me and is making shoes
mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the
doctors room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent
the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he
were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again
he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the
throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old
haggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked
hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted
mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by
a young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking up it
ought to have been finished long ago let it be
he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in
you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper
nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at
a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract
a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on
the air the only ray of hope that mr lorry could discover was that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind
two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as important above
all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie
the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in
conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a
few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been
called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been
these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept
another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he
in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch him
attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for the
first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same
he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that
attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the
window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place
doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on
that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour
after mr lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write
when he put his tools aside as useless until morning mr lorry rose
he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner
looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice
yes for a walk with me why not
he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mr
lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in
some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it
miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he
fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his
on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he
returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and
that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged mr lorry
to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day
at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then
present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing
amiss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long
enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr lorrys
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before
yes for a walk with me why not
this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the
meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had
sat there looking down at the plane tree but on mr lorrys return he
the time went very slowly on and mr lorrys hope darkened and his
heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day
the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days
with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time the secret was
well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first
was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on
his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in
worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at his post on the
tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had
done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the
doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench
and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading
at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which
mr lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly
even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed
as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened
it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the
answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there
how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor
manettes consulting room and to be debating these points outside the
within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side if he
had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have
resolved it but he was by that time clear headed and had none
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain
miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked
out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual
white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the
so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be the only safe
advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken
place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to
the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and
counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however
he was so composedly himself that mr lorry determined to have the aid
he sought and that aid was his own
therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the
doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly
my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is
very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less
glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the
doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced
doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on the
arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray
give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all
for his daughters his daughters my dear manette
if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental
be explicit said the doctor spare no detail
mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded
my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock
of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings
the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how
long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there
are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace
himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to
be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and
great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately
there has been he paused and took a deep breath a slight relapse
the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration
how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock
now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and
collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit
and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all
you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse
no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her
it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted
the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was
very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of
now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his most
considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not
possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of
intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom
i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this
relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it
be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come
about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine
but i dont know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity
knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be
able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little
pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly
and teach me how to be a little more useful
doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and
i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort
that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite
was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask
very much he said it with an involuntary shudder
you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers
mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him
would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on
i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even
believe it in some cases to be quite impossible
now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors arm again
after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this
i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations
would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a
particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it
would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr lorry
the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and
answered in a low voice not at all
now as to the future hinted mr lorry
as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have
great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i
should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that
well well thats good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry
i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence
there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxious to
you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his
to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does
i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always in
singular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it in
part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy
things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery
you are sure that he is not under too great a strain
i think i am quite sure of it
my dear manette if he were overworked now 
my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been a
violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight
excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment
that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this
i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with the
firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of
association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has
happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost
believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted
he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to
be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days he knew that he must face it
the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing his throat we
will call blacksmiths work blacksmiths work we will say to put a
case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad
time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by
the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot
he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious look at
his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go
still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the
you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quite
understand it to be a nice question and yet i think  and there he
you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause
it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings
of this poor mans mind he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved
his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more
practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental
torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not
find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child
he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to mr lorrys
but may not mind i ask for information as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and
bank notes may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go
with it in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the
you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old
i would not keep it said mr lorry shaking his head for he gained
in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted i would recommend him to
sacrifice it i only want your authority i am sure it does no good
come give me your authority like a dear good man for his daughters
very strange to see what a struggle there was within him
in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i would not take
it away while he was present let it be removed when he is not there
let him miss his old companion after an absence
mr lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended they
passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored on the
three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence mr lorry had previously
explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and
on the night of the day on which he left the house mr lorry went into
his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross
carrying a light there with closed doors and in a mysterious and
guilty manner mr lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder for
which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure the
burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire and the tools
shoes and leather were buried in the garden so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds that mr lorry and miss pross
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible
when the newly married pair came home the first person who appeared to
offer his congratulations was sydney carton they had not been at home
many hours when he presented himself he was not improved in habits or
in looks or in manner but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him which was new to the observation of charles darnay
he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of
mr darnay said carton i wish we might be friends
you are good enough to say so as a fashion of speech but i dont
mean any fashion of speech indeed when i say i wish we might be
charles darnay as was natural asked him in all good humour and
upon my life said carton smiling i find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind than to convey to yours however let me try you
remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than than
i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
i remember it too the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for i
always remember them i hope it may be taken into account one day
when all days are at an end for me dont be alarmed i am not going to
i am not at all alarmed earnestness in you is anything but alarming
ah said carton with a careless wave of his hand as if he waved that
away on the drunken occasion in question one of a large number as
you know i was insufferable about liking you and not liking you i
fashion of speech again but mr darnay oblivion is not so easy to
me as you represent it to be to you i have by no means forgotten it
and a light answer does not help me to forget it
if it was a light answer returned darnay i beg your forgiveness
for it i had no other object than to turn a slight thing which to my
surprise seems to trouble you too much aside i declare to you on the
faith of a gentleman that i have long dismissed it from my mind good
heaven what was there to dismiss have i had nothing more important to
remember in the great service you rendered me that day
as to the great service said carton i am bound to avow to you when
you speak of it in that way that it was mere professional claptrap i
dont know that i cared what became of you when i rendered it mind i
say when i rendered it i am speaking of the past
you make light of the obligation returned darnay but i will not
genuine truth mr darnay trust me i have gone aside from my purpose
i was speaking about our being friends now you know me you know i am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men if you doubt it
i prefer to form my own opinion without the aid of his
well at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has never done
but i do and you must take my word for it well if you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation coming and going at odd times i should ask that i might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here that i might
be regarded as an useless and i would add if it were not for the
resemblance i detected between you and me an unornamental piece of
furniture tolerated for its old service and taken no notice of i
doubt if i should abuse the permission it is a hundred to one if i
should avail myself of it four times in a year it would satisfy me i
dare say to know that i had it
that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have
indicated i thank you darnay i may use that freedom with your name
they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away within a minute
afterwards he was to all outward appearance as unsubstantial as ever
when he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross the doctor and mr lorry charles darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms and spoke of sydney carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness he spoke of him in short not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw
he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
we are thoughtful to night said darnay drawing his arm about her
yes dearest charles with her hands on his breast and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him we are rather thoughtful
to night for we have something on our mind to night
will you promise not to press one question on me if i beg you not to
will i promise what will i not promise to my love
what indeed with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him
i think charles poor mr carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to night
that is what you are not to ask me but i think i know he does
if you know it it is enough what would you have me do my life
i would ask you dearest to be very generous with him always and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by i would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very very seldom reveals and that there are deep
wounds in it my dear i have seen it bleeding
it is a painful reflection to me said charles darnay quite
astounded that i should have done him any wrong i never thought this
my husband it is so i fear he is not to be reclaimed there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now but i am sure that he is capable of good things gentle things
she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours
and o my dearest love she urged clinging nearer to him laying her
head upon his breast and raising her eyes to his remember how strong
we are in our happiness and how weak he is in his misery
the supplication touched him home i will always remember it dear
heart i will remember it as long as i live
he bent over the golden head and put the rosy lips to his and folded
her in his arms if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets
could have heard her innocent disclosure and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband he might have cried to the night and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time
a wonderful corner for echoes it has been remarked that corner where
the doctor lived ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband and her father and herself and her old directress and
companion in a life of quiet bliss lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner listening to the echoing footsteps of
at first there were times though she was a perfectly happy young wife
when her work would slowly fall from her hands and her eyes would be
dimmed for there was something coming in the echoes something light
afar off and scarcely audible yet that stirred her heart too much
fluttering hopes and doubts hopes of a love as yet unknown to her
doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy that new delight divided
her breast among the echoes then there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate and who would mourn for her so much swelled to her
that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom then among the
advancing echoes there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words let greater echoes resound as they would the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming they came and
the shady house was sunny with a childs laugh and the divine friend of
children to whom in her trouble she had confided hers seemed to take
her child in his arms as he took the child of old and made it a sacred
ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives and making it predominate nowhere lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds her husbands
step was strong and prosperous among them her fathers firm and equal
lo miss pross in harness of string awakening the echoes as an
unruly charger whip corrected snorting and pawing the earth under the
even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest they were not
harsh nor cruel even when golden hair like her own lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy and he said with a radiant
smile dear papa and mamma i am very sorry to leave you both and to
leave my pretty sister but i am called and i must go those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mothers cheek as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it suffer them and
forbid them not they see my fathers face o father blessed words
thus the rustling of an angels wings got blended with the other
echoes and they were not wholly of earth but had in them that breath
of heaven sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden tomb were
mingled with them also and both were audible to lucie in a hushed
murmur like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore as
the little lucie comically studious at the task of the morning or
dressing a doll at her mothers footstool chattered in the tongues of
the two cities that were blended in her life
the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton some
half dozen times a year at most he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited and would sit among them through the evening as he had once
done often he never came there heated with wine and one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes which has been whispered by
no man ever really loved a woman lost her and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind when she was a wife and a mother
but her children had a strange sympathy with him an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case no echoes tell but it is so and it was so here carton
was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms
and he kept his place with her as she grew the little boy had spoken of
him almost at the last poor carton kiss him for me
mr stryver shouldered his way through the law like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water and dragged his useful friend in
his wake like a boat towed astern as the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight and mostly under water so sydney had a swamped
life of it but easy and strong custom unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace made
it the life he was to lead and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lions jackal than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion stryver was rich had married a florid widow with
property and three boys who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads
these three young gentlemen mr stryver exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in soho and had offered as pupils to
lucies husband delicately saying halloa here are three lumps of
bread and cheese towards your matrimonial picnic darnay the polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread and cheese had quite bloated mr
stryver with indignation which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen by directing them to beware of the
pride of beggars like that tutor fellow he was also in the habit of
declaiming to mrs stryver over his full bodied wine on the arts
mrs darnay had once put in practice to catch him and on the
diamond cut diamond arts in himself madam which had rendered him not
to be caught some of his kings bench familiars who were occasionally
parties to the full bodied wine and the lie excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often that he believed
it himself which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence as to justify any such offenders being carried
off to some suitably retired spot and there hanged out of the way
these were among the echoes to which lucie sometimes pensive sometimes
amused and laughing listened in the echoing corner until her little
daughter was six years old how near to her heart the echoes of her
childs tread came and those of her own dear fathers always active
and self possessed and those of her dear husbands need not be told
nor how the lightest echo of their united home directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste was music to her nor how there were echoes all about her sweet
in her ears of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married if that could be than single and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him and asked her what is
the magic secret my darling of your being everything to all of us
as if there were only one of us yet never seeming to be hurried or to
but there were other echoes from a distance that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time and it was now about
little lucies sixth birthday that they began to have an awful sound
as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising
on a night in mid july one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine mr
lorry came in late from tellsons and sat himself down by lucie and
her husband in the dark window it was a hot wild night and they were
all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the
i began to think said mr lorry pushing his brown wig back that
i should have to pass the night at tellsons we have been so full of
business all day that we have not known what to do first or which way
to turn there is such an uneasiness in paris that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us our customers over there seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough there is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to england
a bad look you say my dear darnay yes but we dont know what reason
there is in it people are so unreasonable some of us at tellsons are
getting old and we really cant be troubled out of the ordinary course
still said darnay you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is
i know that to be sure assented mr lorry trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured and that he grumbled but i
am determined to be peevish after my long days botheration where is
here he is said the doctor entering the dark room at the moment
i am quite glad you are at home for these hurries and forebodings by
which i have been surrounded all day long have made me nervous without
reason you are not going out i hope
no i am going to play backgammon with you if you like said the
i dont think i do like if i may speak my mind i am not fit to be
pitted against you to night is the teaboard still there lucie i cant
of course it has been kept for you
thank ye my dear the precious child is safe in bed
thats right all safe and well i dont know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here thank god but i have been so put out
all day and i am not as young as i was my tea my dear thank ye now
come and take your place in the circle and let us sit quiet and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory
a fancy then my wise pet said mr lorry patting her hand they
are very numerous and very loud though are they not only hear them
headlong mad and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybodys
life footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red the
footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off as the little circle sat in
saint antoine had been that morning a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun a tremendous
roar arose from the throat of saint antoine and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below no matter how far off
who gave them out whence they last came where they began through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked scores at a time over the
heads of the crowd like a kind of lightning no eye in the throng could
have told but muskets were being distributed so were cartridges
powder and ball bars of iron and wood knives axes pikes every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise people who
could lay hold of nothing else set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls every pulse and
heart in saint antoine was on high fever strain and at high fever heat
every living creature there held life as of no account and was demented
as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point so all this raging
