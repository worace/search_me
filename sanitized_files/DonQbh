life may god give him and all his kind i mean the bad doctors for the
all who knew sancho panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly
and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and
grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy mens wits at last doctor
pedro recio agilers of tirteafuera promised to let him have supper that
night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of
hippocrates with this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to
the approach of night and supper time with great anxiety and though
time to his mind stood still and made no progress nevertheless the
hour he so longed for came and they gave him a beef salad with onions
and some boiled calves feet rather far gone at this he fell to with
greater relish than if they had given him francolins from milan
pheasants from rome veal from sorrento partridges from moron or geese
from lavajos and turning to the doctor at supper he said to him look
here senor doctor for the future dont trouble yourself about giving me
dainty things or choice dishes to eat for it will be only taking my
stomach off its hinges it is accustomed to goat cow bacon hung beef
turnips and onions and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes
it receives them squeamishly and sometimes with loathing what the
head carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas
and the rottener they are the better they smell and he can put
whatever he likes into them so long as it is good to eat and ill be
obliged to him and will requite him some day but let nobody play pranks
on me for either we are or we are not let us live and eat in peace and
good fellowship for when god sends the dawn he sends it for all i mean
to govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe let
everyone keep his eye open and look out for the arrow for i can tell
them the devils in cantillana and if they drive me to it theyll see
something that will astonish them nay make yourself honey and the flies
of a truth senor governor said the carver your worship is in the
right of it in everything you have said and i promise you in the name of
all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worship with
all zeal affection and good will for the mild kind of government you
have given a sample of to begin with leaves them no ground for doing or
that i believe said sancho and they would be great fools if they did
or thought otherwise once more i say see to my feeding and my dapples
for that is the great point and what is most to the purpose and when the
hour comes let us go the rounds for it is my intention to purge this
island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle good for nothing
vagabonds for i would have you know that lazy idlers are the same thing
in a state as the drones in a hive that eat up the honey the industrious
bees make i mean to protect the husbandman to preserve to the gentleman
his privileges to reward the virtuous and above all to respect religion
and honour its ministers what say you to that my friends is there
anything in what i say or am i talking to no purpose
there is so much in what your worship says senor governor said the
majordomo that i am filled with wonder when i see a man like your
worship entirely without learning for i believe you have none at all
say such things and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks very
different from what was expected of your worships intelligence by those
who sent us or by us who came here every day we see something new in
this world jokes become realities and the jokers find the tables turned
night came and with the permission of doctor pedro recio the governor
had supper they then got ready to go the rounds and he started with the
majordomo the secretary the head carver the chronicler charged with
recording his deeds and alguacils and notaries enough to form a
fair sized squadron in the midst marched sancho with his staff as fine
a sight as one could wish to see and but a few streets of the town had
been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords they
hastened to the spot and found that the combatants were but two who
seeing the authorities approaching stood still and one of them
exclaimed help in the name of god and the king are men to be allowed
to rob in the middle of this town and rush out and attack people in the
be calm my good man said sancho and tell me what the cause of this
said the other combatant senor governor i will tell you in a very few
words your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more
than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite and god knows how
i was there and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour very
much against what my conscience told me he made off with his winnings
and when i made sure he was going to give me a crown or so at least by
way of a present as it is usual and customary to give men of quality of
my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play and back up swindles and
prevent quarrels he pocketed his money and left the house indignant at
this i followed him and speaking him fairly and civilly asked him to
give me if it were only eight reals for he knows i am an honest man and
that i have neither profession nor property for my parents never brought
me up to any or left me any but the rogue who is a greater thief than
cacus and a greater sharper than andradilla would not give me more than
four reals so your worship may see how little shame and conscience he
has but by my faith if you had not come up id have made him disgorge
his winnings and hed have learned what the range of the steel yard
what say you to this asked sancho the other replied that all his
antagonist said was true and that he did not choose to give him more
than four reals because he very often gave him money and that those who
expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with a
cheerful countenance and not make any claim against winners unless they
know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairly
won and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an
honest man than his having refused to give anything for sharpers always
pay tribute to lookers on who know them
that is true said the majordomo let your worship consider what is to
what is to be done said sancho is this you the winner be you
good bad or indifferent give this assailant of yours a hundred reals
at once and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners and
you who have neither profession nor property and hang about the island
in idleness take these hundred reals now and some time of the day
to morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years and
under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the sentence
for ill hang you on a gibbet or at least the hangman will by my orders
not a word from either of you or ill make him feel my hand
the one paid down the money and the other took it and the latter quitted
the island while the other went home and then the governor said
either i am not good for much or ill get rid of these gambling houses
for it strikes me they are very mischievous
this one at least said one of the notaries your worship will not be
able to get rid of for a great man owns it and what he loses every year
is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards on the
minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power and it is
they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices for in
the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers dare
not attempt to play their tricks and as the vice of gambling has become
common it is better that men should play in houses of repute than in
some tradesmans where they catch an unlucky fellow in the small hours
i know already notary that there is a good deal to be said on that
and now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp and said
senor governor this youth was coming towards us and as soon as he saw
the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer a sure proof
that he must be some evil doer i ran after him and had it not been that
he stumbled and fell i should never have caught him
what did you run for fellow said sancho
to which the young man replied senor it was to avoid answering all the
youre facetious with me you plume yourself on being a wag very good
and where does one take the air in this island
good your answers are very much to the point you are a smart youth
but take notice that i am the air and that i blow upon you a stern and
send you to gaol ho there lay hold of him and take him off ill make
by god said the young man your worship will make me sleep in gaol
why shant i make thee sleep in gaol said sancho have i not the
power to arrest thee and release thee whenever i like
all the power your worship has said the young man wont be able to
how not able said sancho take him away at once where hell see his
mistake with his own eyes even if the gaoler is willing to exert his
interested generosity on his behalf for ill lay a penalty of two
thousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from the prison
thats ridiculous said the young man the fact is all the men on
earth will not make me sleep in prison
tell me you devil said sancho have you got any angel that will
deliver you and take off the irons i am going to order them to put upon
now senor governor said the young man in a sprightly manner let us
be reasonable and come to the point granted your worship may order me to
be taken to prison and to have irons and chains put on me and to be
shut up in a cell and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if he lets
me out and that he obeys your orders still if i dont choose to sleep
and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye will your
worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if i dont choose
no truly said the secretary and the fellow has made his point
so then said sancho it would be entirely of your own choice you
would keep from sleeping not in opposition to my will
well then go and god be with you said sancho be off home to sleep
and god give you sound sleep for i dont want to rob you of it but for
the future let me advise you dont joke with the authorities because
you may come across some one who will bring down the joke on your own
the young man went his way and the governor continued his round and
shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody and said
senor governor this person who seems to be a man is not so but a
woman and not an ill favoured one in mans clothes they raised two or
three lanterns to her face and by their light they distinguished the
features of a woman to all appearance of the age of sixteen or a little
more with her hair gathered into a gold and green silk net and fair as
a thousand pearls they scanned her from head to foot and observed that
she had on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with
gold and pearl her breeches were of green and gold stuff and under an
open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a doublet of the finest white
and gold cloth her shoes were white and such as men wear she carried no
sword at her belt but only a richly ornamented dagger and on her
fingers she had several handsome rings in short the girl seemed fair to
look at in the eyes of all and none of those who beheld her knew her
the people of the town said they could not imagine who she was and those
who were in the secret of the jokes that were to be practised upon sancho
were the ones who were most surprised for this incident or discovery had
not been arranged by them and they watched anxiously to see how the
sancho was fascinated by the girls beauty and he asked her who she was
where she was going and what had induced her to dress herself in that
garb she with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest confusion
i cannot tell you senor before so many people what it is of such
consequence to me to have kept secret one thing i wish to be known that
i am no thief or evildoer but only an unhappy maiden whom the power of
jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to modesty
hearing this the majordomo said to sancho make the people stand back
senor governor that this lady may say what she wishes with less
sancho gave the order and all except the majordomo the head carver and
the secretary fell back finding herself then in the presence of no more
the damsel went on to say i am the daughter sirs of pedro perez
mazorca the wool farmer of this town who is in the habit of coming very
that wont do senora said the majordomo for i know pedro perez very
well and i know he has no child at all either son or daughter and
besides though you say he is your father you add then that he comes
i am confused just now sirs said the damsel and i dont know what i
am saying but the truth is that i am the daughter of diego de la llana
ay that will do said the majordomo for i know diego de la llana
and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man and that he
has a son and a daughter and that since he was left a widower nobody in
all this town can speak of having seen his daughters face for he keeps
her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of
seeing her and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful
it is true said the damsel and i am that daughter whether report
lies or not as to my beauty you sirs will have decided by this time
as you have seen me and with this she began to weep bitterly
on seeing this the secretary leant over to the head carvers ear and
said to him in a low voice something serious has no doubt happened this
poor maiden that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at
such an hour and one of her rank too there can be no doubt about it
returned the carver and moreover her tears confirm your suspicion
sancho gave her the best comfort he could and entreated her to tell them
without any fear what had happened her as they would all earnestly and
by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her
the fact is sirs said she that my father has kept me shut up these
ten years for so long is it since the earth received my mother mass is
said at home in a sumptuous chapel and all this time i have seen but the
sun in the heaven by day and the moon and the stars by night nor do i
know what streets are like or plazas or churches or even men except
my father and a brother i have and pedro perez the wool farmer whom
because he came frequently to our house i took it into my head to call
my father to avoid naming my own this seclusion and the restrictions
laid upon my going out were it only to church have been keeping me
unhappy for many a day and month past i longed to see the world or at
least the town where i was born and it did not seem to me that this wish
was inconsistent with the respect maidens of good quality should have for
themselves when i heard them talking of bull fights taking place and of
javelin games and of acting plays i asked my brother who is a year
younger than myself to tell me what sort of things these were and many
more that i had never seen he explained them to me as well as he could
but the only effect was to kindle in me a still stronger desire to see
them at last to cut short the story of my ruin i begged and entreated
my brother o that i had never made such an entreaty  and once more she
proceed senora said the majordomo and finish your story of what has
happened to you for your words and tears are keeping us all in
i have but little more to say though many a tear to shed said the
damsel for ill placed desires can only be paid for in some such way
the maidens beauty had made a deep impression on the head carvers
heart and he again raised his lantern for another look at her and
thought they were not tears she was shedding but seed pearl or dew of
the meadow nay he exalted them still higher and made oriental pearls
of them and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one
as her tears and sobs seemed to indicate the governor was losing
patience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story and
told her not to keep them waiting any longer for it was late and there
still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over
she with broken sobs and half suppressed sighs went on to say my
misfortune my misadventure is simply this that i entreated my brother
to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes and take me some night
when our father was asleep to see the whole town he overcome by my
entreaties consented and dressing me in this suit and himself in
clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him for he has not a hair
on his chin and might pass for a very beautiful young girl to night
about an hour ago more or less we left the house and guided by our
youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town and
then as we were about to return home we saw a great troop of people
coming and my brother said to me sister this must be the round stir
your feet and put wings to them and follow me as fast as you can lest
they recognise us for that would be a bad business for us and so
saying he turned about and began i cannot say to run but to fly in less
than six paces i fell from fright and then the officer of justice came
up and carried me before your worships where i find myself put to shame
before all these people as whimsical and vicious
so then senora said sancho no other mishap has befallen you nor
was it jealousy that made you leave home as you said at the beginning of
nothing has happened me said she nor was it jealousy that brought me
out but merely a longing to see the world which did not go beyond
the appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody whom one of
them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister now fully confirmed
the truth of what the damsel said he had nothing on but a rich petticoat
and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace and his head was
uncovered and adorned only with its own hair which looked like rings of
gold so bright and curly was it the governor the majordomo and the
carver went aside with him and unheard by his sister asked him how he
came to be in that dress and he with no less shame and embarrassment
told exactly the same story as his sister to the great delight of the
enamoured carver the governor however said to them in truth young
lady and gentleman this has been a very childish affair and to explain
your folly and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all
these tears and sighs for if you had said we are so and so and we
escaped from our fathers house in this way in order to ramble about out
of mere curiosity and with no other object there would have been an end
of the matter and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest
that is true said the damsel but you see the confusion i was in was
so great it did not let me behave as i ought
no harm has been done said sancho come we will leave you at your
fathers house perhaps they will not have missed you and another time
dont be so childish or eager to see the world for a respectable damsel
should have a broken leg and keep at home and the woman and the hen by
gadding about are soon lost and she who is eager to see is also eager to
the youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home and
they directed their steps towards the house which was not far off on
reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating and immediately a
woman servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to
them and they went in leaving the party marvelling as much at their
grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night
and without quitting the village which however they set down to their
the head carver was left with a heart pierced through and through and he
made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her
father on the morrow making sure she would not be refused him as he was
a servant of the dukes and even to sancho ideas and schemes of marrying
the youth to his daughter sanchica suggested themselves and he resolved
to open the negotiation at the proper season persuading himself that no
husband could be refused to a governors daughter and so the nights
round came to an end and a couple of days later the government whereby
all his plans were overthrown and swept away as will be seen farther on
wherein is set forth who the enchanters and executioners were who flogged
the duenna and pinched don quixote and also what befell the page who
carried the letter to teresa panza sancho panzas wife
cide hamete the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this
veracious history says that when dona rodriguez left her own room to go
to don quixotes another duenna who slept with her observed her and as
all duennas are fond of prying listening and sniffing she followed her
so silently that the good rodriguez never perceived it and as soon as
the duenna saw her enter don quixotes room not to fail in a duennas
invariable practice of tattling she hurried off that instant to report
to the duchess how dona rodriguez was closeted with don quixote the
duchess told the duke and asked him to let her and altisidora go and see
what the said duenna wanted with don quixote the duke gave them leave
and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the door of the room and
posted themselves so close to it that they could hear all that was said
inside but when the duchess heard how the rodriguez had made public the
aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself nor altisidora
either and so filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance they burst
into the room and tormented don quixote and flogged the duenna in the
manner already described for indignities offered to their charms and
self esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for
revenge the duchess told the duke what had happened and he was much
amused by it and she in pursuance of her design of making merry and
diverting herself with don quixote despatched the page who had played
the part of dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment which
sancho panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about to
teresa panza his wife with her husbands letter and another from herself
and also a great string of fine coral beads as a present
now the history says this page was very sharp and quick witted and eager
to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for sanchos
village before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a
brook and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a
woman of the name of teresa panza wife of one sancho panza squire to a
knight called don quixote of la mancha at the question a young girl who
was washing stood up and said teresa panza is my mother and that
sancho is my father and that knight is our master
well then miss said the page come and show me where your mother is
for i bring her a letter and a present from your father
that i will with all my heart senor said the girl who seemed to be
about fourteen more or less and leaving the clothes she was washing to
one of her companions and without putting anything on her head or feet
for she was bare legged and had her hair hanging about her away she
skipped in front of the pages horse saying come your worship our
house is at the entrance of the town and my mother is there sorrowful
enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so long
well said the page i am bringing her such good news that she will
and then skipping running and capering the girl reached the town but
before going into the house she called out at the door come out mother
teresa come out come out heres a gentleman with letters and other
things from my good father at these words her mother teresa panza came
out spinning a bundle of flax in a grey petticoat so short was it one
would have fancied they to her shame had cut it short a grey bodice
of the same stuff and a smock she was not very old though plainly past
forty strong healthy vigorous and sun dried and seeing her daughter
and the page on horseback she exclaimed whats this child what
a servant of my lady dona teresa panza replied the page and suiting
the action to the word he flung himself off his horse and with great
humility advanced to kneel before the lady teresa saying let me kiss
your hand senora dona teresa as the lawful and only wife of senor don
sancho panza rightful governor of the island of barataria
ah senor get up do that said teresa for im not a bit of a court
lady but only a poor country woman the daughter of a clodcrusher and
the wife of a squire errant and not of any governor at all
you are said the page the most worthy wife of a most arch worthy
governor and as a proof of what i say accept this letter and this
present and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of
coral beads with gold clasps and placed it on her neck and said this
letter is from his lordship the governor and the other as well as these
coral beads from my lady the duchess who sends me to your worship
teresa stood lost in astonishment and her daughter just as much and the
girl said may i die but our master don quixotes at the bottom of this
he must have given father the government or county he so often promised
that is the truth said the page for it is through senor don quixote
that senor sancho is now governor of the island of barataria as will be
will your worship read it to me noble sir said teresa for though i
can spin i cant read not a scrap
nor i either said sanchica but wait a bit and ill go and fetch
some one who can read it either the curate himself or the bachelor
samson carrasco and theyll come gladly to hear any news of my father
there is no need to fetch anybody said the page for though i cant
spin i can read and ill read it and so he read it through but as it
has been already given it is not inserted here and then he took out the
other one from the duchess which ran as follows
friend teresa your husband sanchos good qualities of heart as well as
of head induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to give
him the government of one of his many islands i am told he governs like
a gerfalcon of which i am very glad and my lord the duke of course
also and i am very thankful to heaven that i have not made a mistake in
choosing him for that same government for i would have senora teresa
know that a good governor is hard to find in this world and may god make
me as good as sanchos way of governing herewith i send you my dear a
string of coral beads with gold clasps i wish they were oriental pearls
but he who gives thee a bone does not wish to see thee dead a time
will come when we shall become acquainted and meet one another but god
knows the future commend me to your daughter sanchica and tell her from
me to hold herself in readiness for i mean to make a high match for her
when she least expects it they tell me there are big acorns in your
village send me a couple of dozen or so and i shall value them greatly
as coming from your hand and write to me at length to assure me of your
health and well being and if there be anything you stand in need of it
is but to open your mouth and that shall be the measure and so god keep
from this place your loving friend the duchess
ah what a good plain lowly lady said teresa when she heard the
letter that i may be buried with ladies of that sort and not the
gentlewomen we have in this town that fancy because they are gentlewomen
the wind must not touch them and go to church with as much airs as if
they were queens no less and seem to think they are disgraced if they
look at a farmers wife and see here how this good lady for all shes a
duchess calls me friend and treats me as if i was her equal and
equal may i see her with the tallest church tower in la mancha and as
for the acorns senor ill send her ladyship a peck and such big ones
that one might come to see them as a show and a wonder and now
sanchica see that the gentleman is comfortable put up his horse and
get some eggs out of the stable and cut plenty of bacon and lets give
him his dinner like a prince for the good news he has brought and his
own bonny face deserve it all and meanwhile ill run out and give the
neighbours the news of our good luck and father curate and master
nicholas the barber who are and always have been such friends of thy
that i will mother said sanchica but mind you must give me half of
that string for i dont think my lady the duchess could have been so
stupid as to send it all to you
it is all for thee my child said teresa but let me wear it round my
neck for a few days for verily it seems to make my heart glad
you will be glad too said the page when you see the bundle there is
in this portmanteau for it is a suit of the finest cloth that the
governor only wore one day out hunting and now sends all for senora
may he live a thousand years said sanchica and the bearer as many
with this teresa hurried out of the house with the letters and with the
string of beads round her neck and went along thrumming the letters as
if they were a tambourine and by chance coming across the curate and
samson carrasco she began capering and saying none of us poor now
faith weve got a little government ay let the finest fine lady tackle
me and ill give her a setting down
whats all this teresa panza said they what madness is this and
the madness is only this said she that these are the letters of
duchesses and governors and these i have on my neck are fine coral
beads with ave marias and paternosters of beaten gold and i am a
god help us said the curate we dont understand you teresa or know
there you may see it yourselves said teresa and she handed them the
the curate read them out for samson carrasco to hear and samson and he
regarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read
and the bachelor asked who had brought the letters teresa in reply bade
them come with her to her house and they would see the messenger a most
elegant youth who had brought another present which was worth as much
more the curate took the coral beads from her neck and examined them
again and again and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he
fell to wondering afresh and said by the gown i wear i dont know what
to say or think of these letters and presents on the one hand i can see
and feel the fineness of these coral beads and on the other i read how a
duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns
square that if you can said carrasco well lets go and see the
messenger and from him well learn something about this mystery that has
they did so and teresa returned with them they found the page sifting a
little barley for his horse and sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be
paved with eggs for his dinner his looks and his handsome apparel
pleased them both greatly and after they had saluted him courteously
and he them samson begged him to give them his news as well of don
quixote as of sancho panza for he said though they had read the
letters from sancho and her ladyship the duchess they were still puzzled
and could not make out what was meant by sanchos government and above
all of an island when all or most of those in the mediterranean belonged
to this the page replied as to senor sancho panzas being a governor
there is no doubt whatever but whether it is an island or not that he
governs with that i have nothing to do suffice it that it is a town of
more than a thousand inhabitants with regard to the acorns i may tell
you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that not to
speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman she has been
known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her neighbours
for i would have your worships know that the ladies of aragon though
they are just as illustrious are not so punctilious and haughty as the
castilian ladies they treat people with greater familiarity
in the middle of this conversation sanchica came in with her skirt full
of eggs and said she to the page tell me senor does my father wear
i have not noticed said the page but no doubt he wears them
ah my god said sanchica what a sight it must be to see my father in
tights isnt it odd that ever since i was born i have had a longing to
as things go you will see that if you live said the page by god he
is in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government only
the curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spoke
in a waggish vein but the fineness of the coral beads and the hunting
suit that sancho sent for teresa had already shown it to them did away
with the impression and they could not help laughing at sanchicas wish
and still more when teresa said senor curate look about if theres
anybody here going to madrid or toledo to buy me a hooped petticoat a
proper fashionable one of the best quality for indeed and indeed i must
do honour to my husbands government as well as i can nay if i am put
to it and have to ill go to court and set a coach like all the world
for she who has a governor for her husband may very well have one and
and why not mother said sanchica would to god it were to day
instead of to morrow even though they were to say when they saw me
seated in the coach with my mother see that rubbish that
garlic stuffed fellows daughter how she goes stretched at her ease in a
coach as if she was a she pope but let them tramp through the mud and
let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground bad luck to backbiters
all over the world let me go warm and the people may laugh do i say
to be sure you do my child said teresa and all this good luck and
even more my good sancho foretold me and thou wilt see my daughter he
wont stop till he has made me a countess for to make a beginning is
everything in luck and as i have heard thy good father say many a time
for besides being thy father hes the father of proverbs too when
they offer thee a heifer run with a halter when they offer thee a
government take it when they would give thee a county seize it when
they say here here to thee with something good swallow it oh no
go to sleep and dont answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky
chances that are knocking at the door of your house
and what do i care added sanchica whether anybody says when he sees
me holding my head up the dog saw himself in hempen breeches and the
hearing this the curate said i do believe that all this family of the
panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides every one of
them i never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all times
that is true said the page for senor governor sancho utters them at
every turn and though a great many of them are not to the purpose still
they amuse one and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly
then you still maintain that all this about sanchos government is true
senor said the bachelor and that there actually is a duchess who
sends him presents and writes to him because we although we have
handled the present and read the letters dont believe it and suspect it
to be something in the line of our fellow townsman don quixote who
fancies that everything is done by enchantment and for this reason i am
almost ready to say that id like to touch and feel your worship to see
whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh
all i know sirs replied the page is that i am a real ambassador
and that senor sancho panza is governor as a matter of fact and that my
lord and lady the duke and duchess can give and have given him this same
government and that i have heard the said sancho panza bears himself
very stoutly therein whether there be any enchantment in all this or
not it is for your worships to settle between you for thats all i know
by the oath i swear and that is by the life of my parents whom i have
it may be so said the bachelor but dubitat augustinus
doubt who will said the page what i have told you is the truth and
that will always rise above falsehood as oil above water if not operibus
credite et non verbis let one of you come with me and he will see with
his eyes what he does not believe with his ears
its for me to make that trip said sanchica take me with you senor
behind you on your horse for ill go with all my heart to see my
governors daughters said the page must not travel along the roads
alone but accompanied by coaches and litters and a great number of
by god said sanchica i can go just as well mounted on a she ass as
in a coach what a dainty lass you must take me for
hush girl said teresa you dont know what youre talking about the
gentleman is quite right for as the time so the behaviour when it was
sancho it was sancha when it is governor its senora i dont know
senora teresa says more than she is aware of said the page and now
give me something to eat and let me go at once for i mean to return this
come and do penance with me said the curate at this for senora
teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest
the page refused but had to consent at last for his own sake and the
curate took him home with him very gladly in order to have an
opportunity of questioning him at leisure about don quixote and his
doings the bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for teresa
but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs for she
thought him somewhat given to joking and so she gave a cake and a couple
of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman and he wrote for her two
letters one for her husband and the other for the duchess dictated out
of her own head which are not the worst inserted in this great history
of the progress of sanchos government and other such entertaining
day came after the night of the governors round a night which the
head carver passed without sleeping so were his thoughts of the face and
air and beauty of the disguised damsel while the majordomo spent what
was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all sancho
said and did being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings for
there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and
deeds the senor governor got up and by doctor pedro recios directions
they made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold
water which sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and
a bunch of grapes but seeing there was no help for it he submitted with
no little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach pedro recio having
persuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits and that
was what was most essential for persons placed in command and in
responsible situations where they have to employ not only the bodily
by means of this sophistry sancho was made to endure hunger and hunger
so keen that in his heart he cursed the government and even him who had
given it to him however with his hunger and his conserve he undertook
to deliver judgments that day and the first thing that came before him
was a question that was submitted to him by a stranger in the presence
of the majordomo and the other attendants and it was in these words
senor a large river separated two districts of one and the same
lordship will your worship please to pay attention for the case is an
important and a rather knotty one well then on this river there was a
bridge and at one end of it a gallows and a sort of tribunal where
four judges commonly sat to administer the law which the lord of river
bridge and the lordship had enacted and which was to this effect if
anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the other he shall declare
on oath where he is going to and with what object and if he swears
truly he shall be allowed to pass but if falsely he shall be put to
death for it by hanging on the gallows erected there without any
remission though the law and its severe penalty were known many
persons crossed but in their declarations it was easy to see at once
they were telling the truth and the judges let them pass free it
happened however that one man when they came to take his declaration
swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that
gallows that stood there and nothing else the judges held a
consultation over the oath and they said if we let this man pass free
he has sworn falsely and by the law he ought to die but if we hang him
as he swore he was going to die on that gallows and therefore swore the
truth by the same law he ought to go free it is asked of your worship
senor governor what are the judges to do with this man for they are
still in doubt and perplexity and having heard of your worships acute
and exalted intellect they have sent me to entreat your worship on their
behalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case
to this sancho made answer indeed those gentlemen the judges that send
you to me might have spared themselves the trouble for i have more of
the obtuse than the acute in me but repeat the case over again so that
i may understand it and then perhaps i may be able to hit the point
the querist repeated again and again what he had said before and then
sancho said it seems to me i can set the matter right in a moment and
in this way the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows but
if he dies upon it he has sworn the truth and by the law enacted
deserves to go free and pass over the bridge but if they dont hang him
then he has sworn falsely and by the same law deserves to be hanged
it is as the senor governor says said the messenger and as regards a
complete comprehension of the case there is nothing left to desire or
well then i say said sancho that of this man they should let pass
the part that has sworn truly and hang the part that has lied and in
this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with
but then senor governor replied the querist the man will have to be
divided into two parts and if he is divided of course he will die and
so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out and it is
look here my good sir said sancho either im a numskull or else
there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and
passing over the bridge for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally
condemns him and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to
the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him
and for absolving him are exactly balanced they should let him pass
freely as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil
this i would give signed with my name if i knew how to sign and what i
have said in this case is not out of my own head but one of the many
precepts my master don quixote gave me the night before i left to become
governor of this island that came into my mind and it was this that
when there was any doubt about the justice of a case i should lean to
mercy and it is gods will that i should recollect it now for it fits
this case as if it was made for it
that is true said the majordomo and i maintain that lycurgus
himself who gave laws to the lacedemonians could not have pronounced a
better decision than the great panza has given let the mornings
audience close with this and i will see that the senor governor has
thats all i ask for fair play said sancho give me my dinner and
then let it rain cases and questions on me and ill despatch them in a
the majordomo kept his word for he felt it against his conscience to
kill so wise a governor by hunger particularly as he intended to have
done with him that same night playing off the last joke he was
it came to pass then that after he had dined that day in opposition to
the rules and aphorisms of doctor tirteafuera as they were taking away
the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixote for the
governor sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself and if
there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud the
secretary did so and after he had skimmed the contents he said it may
well be read aloud for what senor don quixote writes to your worship
deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold and it is as
don quixote of la manchas letter to sancho panza governor of the island
when i was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders friend
sancho i have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense for
which i give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the
dunghill and of fools to make wise men they tell me thou dost govern as
if thou wert a man and art a man as if thou wert a beast so great is
the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself but i would have thee
bear in mind sancho that very often it is fitting and necessary for the
authority of office to resist the humility of the heart for the seemly
array of one who is invested with grave duties should be such as they
require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may lead him to
prefer dress well a stick dressed up does not look like a stick i do
not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment or that being a
judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier but that thou shouldst array
thyself in the apparel thy office requires and that at the same time it
be neat and handsome to win the good will of the people thou governest
there are two things among others that thou must do one is to be civil
to all this however i told thee before and the other to take care
that food be abundant for there is nothing that vexes the heart of the
poor more than hunger and high prices make not many proclamations but
those thou makest take care that they be good ones and above all that
they be observed and carried out for proclamations that are not observed
are the same as if they did not exist nay they encourage the idea that
the prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the
power to enforce them and laws that threaten and are not enforced come
to be like the log the king of the frogs that frightened them at first
but that in time they despised and mounted upon be a father to virtue
and a stepfather to vice be not always strict nor yet always lenient
but observe a mean between these two extremes for in that is the aim of
wisdom visit the gaols the slaughter houses and the market places for
the presence of the governor is of great importance in such places it
comforts the prisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release it is the
bugbear of the butchers who have then to give just weight and it is the
terror of the market women for the same reason let it not be seen that
thou art even if perchance thou art which i do not believe covetous a
follower of women or a glutton for when the people and those that have
dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bring
their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter till they have brought
thee down to the depths of perdition consider and reconsider con and
con over again the advices and the instructions i gave thee before thy
departure hence to thy government and thou wilt see that in them if
thou dost follow them thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for
thee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors at every step
write to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful to them for
ingratitude is the daughter of pride and one of the greatest sins we
know of and he who is grateful to those who have been good to him shows
that he will be so to god also who has bestowed and still bestows so many
my lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another
present to thy wife teresa panza we expect the answer every moment i
have been a little indisposed through a certain scratching i came in for
not very much to the benefit of my nose but it was nothing for if there
are enchanters who maltreat me there are also some who defend me let me
know if the majordomo who is with thee had any share in the trifaldi
performance as thou didst suspect and keep me informed of everything
that happens thee as the distance is so short all the more as i am
thinking of giving over very shortly this idle life i am now leading for
i was not born for it a thing has occurred to me which i am inclined to
think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess but though i
am sorry for it i do not care for after all i must obey my calling
rather than their pleasure in accordance with the common saying amicus
plato sed magis amica veritas i quote this latin to thee because i
conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it
adieu god keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone
sancho listened to the letter with great attention and it was praised
and considered wise by all who heard it he then rose up from table and
calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room and
without putting it off any longer set about answering his master don
quixote at once and he bade the secretary write down what he told him
without adding or suppressing anything which he did and the answer was
sancho panzas letter to don quixote of la mancha
the pressure of business is so great upon me that i have no time to
scratch my head or even to cut my nails and i have them so long god send
a remedy for it i say this master of my soul that you may not be
surprised if i have not until now sent you word of how i fare well or
ill in this government in which i am suffering more hunger than when we
two were wandering through the woods and wastes
my lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies
had got into this island to kill me but up to the present i have not
found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town
for killing all the governors that come here he is called doctor pedro
recio and is from tirteafuera so you see what a name he has to make me
dread dying under his hands this doctor says of himself that he does not
cure diseases when there are any but prevents them coming and the
medicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare
bones as if leanness was not worse than fever
in short he is killing me with hunger and i am dying myself of vexation
for when i thought i was coming to this government to get my meat hot and
my drink cool and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds i
find i have come to do penance as if i was a hermit and as i dont do it
willingly i suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off
so far i have not handled any dues or taken any bribes and i dont know
what to think of it for here they tell me that the governors that come
to this island before entering it have plenty of money either given to
them or lent to them by the people of the town and that this is the
usual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments
last night going the rounds i came upon a fair damsel in mans clothes
and a brother of hers dressed as a woman my head carver has fallen in
love with the girl and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife so he
says and i have chosen youth for a son in law to day we are going to
explain our intentions to the father of the pair who is one diego de la
llana a gentleman and an old christian as much as you please
i have visited the market places as your worship advises me and
yesterday i found a stall keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to
have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new i
confiscated the whole for the children of the charity school who will
know how to distinguish them well enough and i sentenced her not to come
into the market place for a fortnight they told me i did bravely i can
tell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no
people worse than the market women for they are all barefaced
unconscionable and impudent and i can well believe it from what i have
i am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife teresa panza
and sent her the present your worship speaks of and i will strive to
show myself grateful when the time comes kiss her hands for me and tell
her i say she has not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it as she
will see in the end i should not like your worship to have any
difference with my lord and lady for if you fall out with them it is
plain it must do me harm and as you give me advice to be grateful it
will not do for your worship not to be so yourself to those who have
shown you such kindness and by whom you have been treated so hospitably
that about the scratching i dont understand but i suppose it must be
one of the ill turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship
when we meet i shall know all about it i wish i could send your worship
