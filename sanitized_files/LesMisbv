it was in fact eponine who had addressed thenardier
at the apparition of eponine the other five that is to say
claquesous guelemer babet brujon and montparnasse had noiselessly
drawn near without precipitation without uttering a word with the
sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night
some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands
guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call
ah see here what are you about there what do you want with us are
you crazy exclaimed thenardier as loudly as one can exclaim and still
speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for
eponine burst out laughing and threw herself on his neck
i am here little father because i am here isnt a person allowed to
sit on the stones nowadays its you who ought not to be here what
have you come here for since its a biscuit i told magnon so theres
nothing to be done here but embrace me my good little father its a
long time since ive seen you so youre out
thenardier tried to disentangle himself from eponines arms and
thats good youve embraced me yes im out im not in now get
but eponine did not release her hold and redoubled her caresses
but how did you manage it little pa you must have been very clever to
get out of that tell me about it and my mother where is mother tell
shes well i dont know let me alone and be off i tell you
i wont go so there now pouted eponine like a spoiled child you
send me off and its four months since i saw you and ive hardly had
and she caught her father round the neck again
make haste said guelemer the cops may pass
nous n sommes pas le jour de lan
why its monsieur brujon good day monsieur babet good day
monsieur claquesous dont you know me monsieur guelemer how goes it
yes they know you ejaculated thenardier but good day good
its the hour for foxes not for chickens said montparnasse
you see the job we have on hand here added babet
take care said he youll cut yourself ive a knife open
my little montparnasse responded eponine very gently you must have
confidence in people i am the daughter of my father perhaps monsieur
babet monsieur guelemer im the person who was charged to investigate
it is remarkable that eponine did not talk slang that frightful tongue
had become impossible to her since she had known marius
she pressed in her hand small bony and feeble as that of a skeleton
you know well that im no fool ordinarily i am believed i have
rendered you service on various occasions well i have made inquiries
you will expose yourselves to no purpose you see i swear to you that
and he pointed out to eponine across the tops of the trees a light
which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion it was
toussaint who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry
well said she theyre very poor folks and its a hovel where there
go to the devil cried thenardier when weve turned the house upside
down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below well tell
you what there is inside and whether its francs or sous or
and he pushed her aside with the intention of entering
my good friend mr montparnasse said eponine i entreat you you
decamp my girl and leave men to their own affairs
eponine released montparnasses hand which she had grasped again and
then she set her back against the gate faced the six ruffians who were
armed to the teeth and to whom the night lent the visages of demons
they halted in amazement the ventriloquist however finished his grin
friends listen well this is not what you want now im talking in
the first place if you enter this garden if you lay a hand on this
gate ill scream ill beat on the door ill rouse everybody ill
have the whole six of you seized ill call the police
shed do it too said thenardier in a low tone to brujon and the
not so close my good man said she
she began to laugh in a terrible way
as you like but you shall not enter here im not the daughter of
a dog since im the daughter of a wolf there are six of you what
matters that to me you are men well im a woman you dont frighten
me i tell you that you shant enter this house because it doesnt suit
me if you approach ill bark i told you im the dog and i dont
care a straw for you go your way you bore me go where you please but
dont come here i forbid it you can use your knives ill use kicks
its all the same to me come on
she advanced a pace nearer the ruffians she was terrible she burst out
pardine im not afraid i shall be hungry this summer and i shall be
cold this winter arent they ridiculous these ninnies of men to think
they can scare a girl what scare oh yes much because you have
finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a
big voice forsooth i aint afraid of anything that i aint
she fastened her intent gaze upon thenardier and said
then she continued as she cast her blood shot spectre like eyes upon
what do i care if im picked up to morrow morning on the pavement of
the rue plumet killed by the blows of my fathers club or whether im
found a year from now in the nets at saint cloud or the isle of swans in
the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs
she was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough her breath came
from her weak and narrow chest like the death rattle
i have only to cry out and people will come and then slap bang
there are six of you i represent the whole world
well no i wont approach but dont speak so loud so you intend to
hinder us in our work my daughter but we must earn our living all the
same have you no longer any kind feeling for your father
so saying she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and
mon bras si dodu my arm so plump
ma jambe bien faite my leg well formed
she had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and she
swung her foot with an air of indifference her tattered gown permitted
a view of her thin shoulder blades the neighboring street lantern
illuminated her profile and her attitude nothing more resolute and more
the six rascals speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl
retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern and held counsel with
in the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air
theres something the matter with her said babet a reason is she
in love with the dog its a shame to miss this anyway two women an
old fellow who lodges in the back yard and curtains that aint so bad
at the windows the old cove must be a jew i think the jobs a good
well go in then the rest of you exclaimed montparnasse do the
job ill stay here with the girl and if she fails us 
he flashed the knife which he held open in his hand in the light of
thenardier said not a word and seemed ready for whatever the rest
brujon who was somewhat of an oracle and who had as the reader knows
put up the job had not as yet spoken he seemed thoughtful he had
the reputation of not sticking at anything and it was known that he
had plundered a police post simply out of bravado besides this he made
verses and songs which gave him great authority
brujon remained silent an instant longer then he shook his head in
see here this morning i came across two sparrows fighting this
evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling all thats bad lets
never mind if they had wanted id have cut her throat
at the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following
where shall we go to sleep to night
have you the key to the gate thenardier
eponine who never took her eyes off of them saw them retreat by the
road by which they had come she rose and began to creep after them
along the walls and the houses she followed them thus as far as the
there they parted and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom
after the departure of the ruffians the rue plumet resumed its
tranquil nocturnal aspect that which had just taken place in this
street would not have astonished a forest the lofty trees the copses
the heaths the branches rudely interlaced the tall grass exist in
a sombre manner the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden
apparitions of the invisible that which is below man distinguishes
through the mists that which is beyond man and the things of which we
living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night nature
bristling and wild takes alarm at certain approaches in which she
fancies that she feels the supernatural the forces of the gloom know
each other and are strangely balanced by each other teeth and claws
fear what they cannot grasp blood drinking bestiality voracious
appetites hunger in search of prey the armed instincts of nails
and jaws which have for source and aim the belly glare and smell out
uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud erect
in its vague and shuddering robe and which seem to them to live with
a dead and terrible life these brutalities which are only matter
entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity
condensed into an unknown being a black figure barring the way stops
the wild beast short that which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave the ferocious fear the
sinister wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul
chapter vi marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving
while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the
gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by
never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the
trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had
the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise never had
all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the
inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy
but he had found cosette sad cosette had been weeping her eyes were
this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream
marius first word had been what is the matter
then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he
tremblingly took his place beside her she had continued
my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he
has business and we may go away from here
when one is at the end of ones life to die means to go away when one
is at the beginning of it to go away means to die
for the last six weeks marius had little by little slowly by degrees
taken possession of cosette each day as we have already explained in
the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later
on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take
the soul at all the faublas and the prudhommes add because there is
none but the sarcasm is fortunately a blasphemy so marius possessed
cosette as spirits possess but he enveloped her with all his soul and
seized her jealously with incredible conviction he possessed her smile
her breath her perfume the profound radiance of her blue eyes the
sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which
she had on her neck all her thoughts therefore he possessed all
he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his
breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to
himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong
to him marius he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her
knot of ribbon her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred
objects of which he was the master he dreamed that he was the lord of
those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to
himself in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which
did not make their way to the light that there was not a ribbon of her
gown not a mesh in her stockings not a fold in her bodice which was
not his beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his
own thing his own despot and his slave it seemed as though they had
so intermingled their souls that it would have been impossible to tell
them apart had they wished to take them back again this is mine
no it is mine i assure you that you are mistaken this is my
property what you are taking as your own is myself marius was
something that made a part of cosette and cosette was something which
made a part of marius marius felt cosette within him to have cosette
to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from
breathing it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of
this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty
that these words we are going away fell suddenly at a blow and
that the harsh voice of reality cried to him cosette is not yours
marius awoke for six weeks marius had been living as we have said
outside of life those words going away caused him to re enter it
he found not a word to say cosette merely felt that his hand was very
cold she said to him in her turn what is the matter
he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him
this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to
hold myself in readiness that he would give me his linen to put in a
trunk that he was obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away
that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for
him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might
it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power no violence not
one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of
tiberius or of henry viii could have equalled this in atrocity
in the opinion of marius m fauchelevent taking his daughter off to
cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes all filled with anguish
what do you expect me to do she said clasping her hands
cosette took marius hand and pressed it without replying
very well said marius then i will go elsewhere
cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words
she turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom she
marius looked at her then raised his eyes to heaven and answered
when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him the smile of a
woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance even at night
how silly we are marius i have an idea
if we go away do you go too i will tell you where come and join me
marius was now a thoroughly roused man he had fallen back into reality
go away with you are you mad why i should have to have money and i
have none go to england but i am in debt now i owe i dont know how
much more than ten louis to courfeyrac one of my friends with whom you
are not acquainted i have an old hat which is not worth three francs
i have a coat which lacks buttons in front my shirt is all ragged my
elbows are torn my boots let in the water for the last six weeks i
have not thought about it and i have not told you about it you only
see me at night and you give me your love if you were to see me in the
daytime you would give me a sou go to england eh i havent enough to
he threw himself against a tree which was close at hand erect his brow
pressed close to the bark feeling neither the wood which flayed his
skin nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples and there he
stood motionless on the point of falling like the statue of despair
he remained a long time thus one could remain for eternity in such
abysses at last he turned round he heard behind him a faint stifled
she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he
he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he
took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and
she let him have his way in silence there are moments when a woman
accepts like a sombre and resigned goddess the religion of love
not when i may be going away and you cannot come
she replied sobbing by that word from paradise which is never more
he continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress
do not weep tell me will you do this for me and cease to weep
cosette i have never given my word of honor to any one because my
word of honor terrifies me i feel that my father is by my side well i
give you my most sacred word of honor that if you go away i shall die
in the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so
solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembled she felt that chill which
is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by the shock made
now listen said he do not expect me to morrow
do not expect me until the day after to morrow
a day without seeing you but that is impossible
let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps
and marius added in a low tone and in an aside
he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received any
of what man are you speaking asked cosette
she took his head in both her hands raising herself on tiptoe in order
to be on a level with him and tried to read his hope in his eyes
now that i think of it you ought to know my address something might
happen one never knows i live with that friend named courfeyrac rue
he searched in his pocket pulled out his penknife and with the blade
he wrote on the plaster of the wall
in the meantime cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more
tell me your thought marius you have some idea tell it to me oh
tell me so that i may pass a pleasant night
this is my idea that it is impossible that god should mean to part us
wait expect me the day after to morrow
what shall i do until then said cosette you are outside you go
and come how happy men are i shall remain entirely alone oh how sad
i shall be what is it that you are going to do to morrow evening tell
then i will pray to god and i will think of you here so that you may
be successful i will question you no further since you do not wish it
you are my master i shall pass the evening to morrow in singing that
music from euryanthe that you love and that you came one evening to
listen to outside my shutters but day after to morrow you will come
early i shall expect you at dusk at nine oclock precisely i warn
you mon dieu how sad it is that the days are so long on the stroke of
nine do you understand i shall be in the garden
and without having uttered it moved by the same thought impelled by
those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication
both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow they fell into
each others arms without perceiving that their lips met while their
uplifted eyes overflowing with rapture and full of tears gazed upon
when marius went forth the street was deserted this was the moment
when eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard
while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an
idea had crossed his mind an idea alas that he himself judged to be
senseless and impossible he had come to a desperate decision
chapter vii the old heart and the young heart in the presence of each
at that epoch father gillenormand was well past his ninety first
birthday he still lived with mademoiselle gillenormand in the rue des
filles du calvaire no 6 in the old house which he owned he was as
the reader will remember one of those antique old men who await death
perfectly erect whom age bears down without bending and whom even
still his daughter had been saying for some time my father is
sinking he no longer boxed the maids ears he no longer thumped
the landing place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in
opening the door the revolution of july had exasperated him for the
space of barely six months he had viewed almost tranquilly that
coupling of words in the moniteur m humblot conte peer of france
the fact is that the old man was deeply dejected he did not bend he
did not yield this was no more a characteristic of his physical than
of his moral nature but he felt himself giving way internally for four
years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that
is the exact word in the conviction that that good for nothing young
scamp would ring at his door some day or other now he had reached
the point where at certain gloomy hours he said to himself that
if marius made him wait much longer it was not death that was
insupportable to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never see
marius again the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered
his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and
it chilled him absence as is always the case in genuine and natural
sentiments had only served to augment the grandfathers love for the
ungrateful child who had gone off like a flash it is during december
nights when the cold stands at ten degrees that one thinks oftenest of
m gillenormand was or thought himself above all things incapable
of taking a single step he the grandfather towards his grandson i
would die rather he said to himself he did not consider himself
as the least to blame but he thought of marius only with profound
tenderness and the mute despair of an elderly kindly old man who is
he began to lose his teeth which added to his sadness
m gillenormand without however acknowledging it to himself for it
would have rendered him furious and ashamed had never loved a mistress
he had had placed in his chamber opposite the head of his bed so that
it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking an
old portrait of his other daughter who was dead madame pontmercy
a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen he gazed
incessantly at that portrait one day he happened to say as he gazed
to my sister inquired mademoiselle gillenormand yes certainly
once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost
closed in a despondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him
father are you as angry with him as ever
he raised his aged head laid his withered and emaciated fist on the
table and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone
poor marius do you say that gentleman is a knave a wretched
scoundrel a vain little ingrate a heartless soulless haughty and
and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that
three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours to say
i had the honor to ask mademoiselle gillenormand never to mention him
aunt gillenormand renounced every effort and pronounced this acute
diagnosis my father never cared very much for my sister after her
folly it is clear that he detests marius
after her folly meant after she had married the colonel
however as the reader has been able to conjecture mademoiselle
gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite the
officer of lancers for marius the substitute theodule had not been a
success m gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo a vacancy
in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop gap theodule on his
side though he scented the inheritance was disgusted at the task
of pleasing the goodman bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the
goodman lieutenant theodule was gay no doubt but a chatter box
frivolous but vulgar a high liver but a frequenter of bad company he
had mistresses it is true and he had a great deal to say about them
it is true also but he talked badly all his good qualities had a
defect m gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the
love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue
de babylone and then lieutenant gillenormand sometimes came in his
uniform with the tricolored cockade this rendered him downright
intolerable finally father gillenormand had said to his daughter
ive had enough of that theodule i havent much taste for warriors
in time of peace receive him if you choose i dont know but i prefer
slashers to fellows that drag their swords the clash of blades in
battle is less dismal after all than the clank of the scabbard on
the pavement and then throwing out your chest like a bully and
lacing yourself like a girl with stays under your cuirass is doubly
ridiculous when one is a veritable man one holds equally aloof
from swagger and from affected airs he is neither a blusterer nor a
finnicky hearted man keep your theodule for yourself
it was in vain that his daughter said to him but he is your
grandnephew nevertheless it turned out that m gillenormand who
was a grandfather to the very finger tips was not in the least a
in fact as he had good sense and as he had compared the two theodule
had only served to make him regret marius all the more
one evening it was the 24th of june which did not prevent father
gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth he had dismissed his
daughter who was sewing in a neighboring apartment he was alone in
his chamber amid its pastoral scenes with his feet propped on the
andirons half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer with
its nine leaves with his elbow resting on a table where burned two
candles under a green shade engulfed in his tapestry armchair and in
his hand a book which he was not reading he was dressed according
to his wont like an incroyable and resembled an antique portrait by
garat this would have made people run after him in the street had not
his daughter covered him up whenever he went out in a vast bishops
wadded cloak which concealed his attire at home he never wore a
dressing gown except when he rose and retired it gives one a look of
father gillenormand was thinking of marius lovingly and bitterly and
as usual bitterness predominated his tenderness once soured always
ended by boiling and turning to indignation he had reached the point
where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his
heart he was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason
why marius should return that if he intended to return he should
have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea he was trying to
accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should
die without having beheld that gentleman again but his whole nature
revolted his aged paternity would not consent to this well said
he this was his doleful refrain he will not return his bald head
had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze
in the very midst of his revery his old servant basque entered and
the old man sat up erect pallid and like a corpse which rises under
the influence of a galvanic shock all his blood had retreated to his
i dont know replied basque intimidated and put out of countenance
by his masters air i have not seen him nicolette came in and said to
me theres a young man here say that it is m marius
and he remained in the same attitude with shaking head and his eyes
fixed on the door it opened once more a young man entered it was
marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter
his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by
the shade nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad
it was several minutes before father gillenormand dulled with amazement
and joy could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the
presence of an apparition he was on the point of swooning he saw
marius through a dazzling light it certainly was he it certainly was
at last after the lapse of four years he grasped him entire so to
speak in a single glance he found him noble handsome distinguished
well grown a complete man with a suitable mien and a charming air he
felt a desire to open his arms to call him to fling himself forward
his heart melted with rapture affectionate words swelled and overflowed
his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached
his lips and by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of
his nature what came forth was harshness he said abruptly
m gillenormand would have liked to have marius throw himself into his
arms he was displeased with marius and with himself he was conscious
that he was brusque and that marius was cold it caused the goodman
unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn
within and only to be able to be hard outside bitterness returned he
that then signified if you do not come to embrace me marius looked
at his grandfather whose pallor gave him a face of marble
have you come to beg my pardon do you acknowledge your faults
he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child
would yield marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was
required of him he dropped his eyes and replied
then exclaimed the old man impetuously with a grief that was
poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me
marius clasped his hands advanced a step and said in a feeble and
these words touched m gillenormand uttered a little sooner they would
have rendered him tender but they came too late the grandfather rose
he supported himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white
his brow wavered but his lofty form towered above marius as he bowed
pity on you sir it is youth demanding pity of the old man of
ninety one you are entering into life i am leaving it you go to the
play to balls to the cafe to the billiard hall you have wit you
please the women you are a handsome fellow as for me i spit on my
brands in the heart of summer you are rich with the only riches that
are really such i possess all the poverty of age infirmity isolation
you have your thirty two teeth a good digestion bright eyes strength
appetite health gayety a forest of black hair i have no longer even
white hair i have lost my teeth i am losing my legs i am losing my
memory there are three names of streets that i confound incessantly
the rue charlot the rue du chaume and the rue saint claude that
is what i have come to you have before you the whole future full of
sunshine and i am beginning to lose my sight so far am i advancing
into the night you are in love that is a matter of course i am
beloved by no one in all the world and you ask pity of me parbleu
moliere forgot that if that is the way you jest at the courthouse
messieurs the lawyers i sincerely compliment you you are droll
and the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice
come now what do you want of me
sir said marius i know that my presence is displeasing to you but
i have come merely to ask one thing of you and then i shall go away
you are a fool said the old man who said that you were to go away
this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of
ask my pardon throw yourself on my neck
m gillenormand felt that marius would leave him in a few moments that
his harsh reception had repelled the lad that his hardness was driving
him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and
as his grief was straightway converted into wrath it increased his
harshness he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did
what you deserted me your grandfather you left my house to go no
one knows whither you drove your aunt to despair you went off it is
easily guessed to lead a bachelor life its more convenient to play
the dandy to come in at all hours to amuse yourself you have given me
no signs of life you have contracted debts without even telling me to
pay them you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer and at
the end of four years you come to me and that is all you have to say
this violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive
only of silence on the part of marius m gillenormand folded his arms
a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious and apostrophized
let us make an end of this you have come to ask something of me you
sir said marius with the look of a man who feels that he is falling
over a precipice i have come to ask your permission to marry
m gillenormand rang the bell basque opened the door half way
a second later the door was opened once more mademoiselle gillenormand
did not enter but showed herself marius was standing mute with
pendant arms and the face of a criminal m gillenormand was pacing back
and forth in the room he turned to his daughter and said to her
nothing it is monsieur marius say good day to him monsieur wishes to
the curt hoarse sound of the old mans voice announced a strange degree
of excitement the aunt gazed at marius with a frightened air hardly
appeared to recognize him did not allow a gesture or a syllable to
escape her and disappeared at her fathers breath more swiftly than a
in the meantime father gillenormand had returned and placed his back
you marry at one and twenty you have arranged that you have only
a permission to ask a formality sit down sir well you have had a
revolution since i had the honor to see you last the jacobins got the
upper hand you must have been delighted are you not a republican since
you are a baron you can make that agree the republic makes a good
sauce for the barony are you one of those decorated by july have you
taken the louvre at all sir quite near here in the rue saint antoine
opposite the rue des nonamdieres there is a cannon ball incrusted in
the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription july
28th 1830 go take a look at that it produces a good effect ah
those friends of yours do pretty things by the way arent they
erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of m le duc de berry
so you want to marry whom can one inquire without indiscretion
he paused and before marius had time to answer he added violently
come now you have a profession a fortune made how much do you earn
nothing said marius with a sort of firmness and resolution that was
nothing then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred
