she pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor he entered
in that room which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the
chimney piece there were three men one standing erect another
kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt the
the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in
the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously as
he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he
had written to m gillenormand to demand his son the malady had grown
worse on the very evening of marius arrival at vernon the colonel had
had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the
servants efforts to prevent him crying my son is not coming i shall
go to meet him then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the
floor of the antechamber he had just expired
the doctor had been summoned and the cure the doctor had arrived too
late the son had also arrived too late
by the dim light of the candle a large tear could be distinguished on
the pale and prostrate colonels cheek where it had trickled from his
dead eye the eye was extinguished but the tear was not yet dry that
marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that
venerable and manly face on those open eyes which saw not on those
white locks those robust limbs on which here and there brown
lines marking sword thrusts and a sort of red stars which indicated
bullet holes were visible he contemplated that gigantic sear which
stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted
goodness he reflected that this man was his father and that this man
was dead and a chill ran over him
the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the
presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in
anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber the servant woman was
lamenting in a corner the cure was praying and his sobs were audible
the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping
the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of
their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there
marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at
his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the
floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of
at the same time he experienced remorse and he despised himself for
behaving in this manner but was it his fault he did not love his
the colonel had left nothing the sale of big furniture barely paid the
the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius it
for my son the emperor made me a baron on the battle field of
waterloo since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i
purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will
be worthy of it is a matter of course below the colonel had added
at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life the mans
name was thenardier i think that he has recently been keeping a
little inn in a village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles or
montfermeil if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to
marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father
but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in
nothing remained of the colonel m gillenormand had his sword and
uniform sold to an old clothes dealer the neighbors devastated the
garden and pillaged the rare flowers the other plants turned to nettles
marius remained only forty eight hours at vernon after the interment he
returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with
no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived in two
days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten
marius wore crape on his hat that was all
chapter v the utility of going to mass in order to become a
marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood one sunday
when he went to hear mass at saint sulpice at that same chapel of the
virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad he placed himself
behind a pillar being more absent minded and thoughtful than usual on
that occasion and knelt down without paying any special heed upon a
chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name
monsieur mabeuf warden mass had hardly begun when an old man presented
marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his
the mass concluded marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant
the old man approached him again and said
i beg your pardon sir for having disturbed you a while ago and for
again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought me intrusive
there is no need of that sir said marius
yes went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of
me you see i am attached to this place it seems to me that the mass
is better from here why i will tell you it is from this place that
i have watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three
months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and
no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family
arrangements he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be
brought to mass the little one never suspected that his father was
there perhaps he did not even know that he had a father poor innocent
the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen he gazed
at his child and he wept he adored that little fellow poor man i
could see that this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have
contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass i prefer it
to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of warden i knew
that unhappy gentleman a little too he had a father in law a wealthy
aunt relatives i dont know exactly what all who threatened to
disinherit the child if he the father saw him he sacrificed himself
in order that his son might be rich and happy some day he was separated
from him because of political opinions certainly i approve of
political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop
mon dieu a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo a father
is not separated from his child for such a reason as that he was one of
bonapartes colonels he is dead i believe he lived at vernon where i
have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pontmarie
or montpercy he had a fine sword cut on my honor
the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed
ah you are the child yes thats true he must be a man by this
time well poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you
marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings
on the following day he said to m gillenormand
i have arranged a hunting party with some friends will you permit me
four replied his grandfather go and amuse yourself
and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love
chapter vi the consequences of having met a warden
where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on
marius was absent for three days then he returned to paris went
straight to the library of the law school and asked for the files of the
he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and
the empire the memorial de sainte helene all the memoirs all the
newspapers the bulletins the proclamations he devoured everything
the first time that he came across his fathers name in the bulletins of
the grand army he had a fever for a week he went to see the generals
under whom georges pontmercy had served among others comte h
church warden mabeuf whom he went to see again told him about the life
at vernon the colonels retreat his flowers his solitude marius came
to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species
of lion lamb who had been his father
in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all
his moments as well as his thoughts he hardly saw the gillenormands at
all he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he
was not to be found father gillenormand smiled bah bah he is just
of the age for the girls sometimes the old man added the deuce
i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an
it was a passion in fact marius was on the high road to adoring his
at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change the
phases of this change were numerous and successive as this is the
history of many minds of our day we think it will prove useful to
follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all
that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him
up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only
monstrous words the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire
a sword in the night he had just taken a look at it and where he had
expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had beheld with a sort
of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling
danton and a sun arise napoleon he did not know where he stood he
recoiled blinded by the brilliant lights little by little when his
astonishment had passed off he grew accustomed to this radiance he
contemplated these deeds without dizziness he examined these personages
without terror the revolution and the empire presented themselves
luminously in perspective before his minds eye he beheld each of
these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts the
republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses
the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe he
beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and
the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire he asserted
in his conscience that all this had been good what his dazzled state
neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not
think it necessary to point out here it is the state of a mind on the
march that we are recording progress is not accomplished in one stage
that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as
he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his
country no more than he had comprehended his father he had not known
either the one or the other and a sort of voluntary night had obscured
his eyes now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other
he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that
all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb oh if his
father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in
his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still
among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated
himself how he would have cried to his father father here i am it
is i i have the same heart as thou i am thy son how he would have
embraced that white head bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scar
pressed his hands adored his garment kissed his feet oh why had his
father died so early before his time before the justice the love of
his son had come to him marius had a continual sob in his heart which
said to him every moment alas at the same time he became more truly
serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith at
each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason an inward
growth seemed to be in progress within him he was conscious of a sort
of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to
as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that
which he had hated he penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth
he plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the
great things which he had been taught to detest and of the great men
whom he had been instructed to curse when he reflected on his former
opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless
seemed to him already so very ancient he grew indignant yet he smiled
from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the
but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor
from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of
1814 on bonaparte now all the prejudices of the restoration all its
interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon it execrated
him even more than it did robespierre it had very cleverly turned to
sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of
mothers bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order
to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately
pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of 1814
made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from
that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is
terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo thus in
speaking of bonaparte one was free to sob or to puff up with
laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom marius had never
entertained about that man as he was called any other ideas in his
mind they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature
there was in him a headstrong little man who hated napoleon
on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and
materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes
of marius was gradually rent he caught a glimpse of something immense
and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment on
the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more
distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost
regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though
attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then
the vaguely illuminated steps at last the luminous and splendid steps
one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof his candle
was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close
to the open window all sorts of reveries reached him from space and
mingled with his thoughts what a spectacle is the night one hears dull
sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholds jupiter which
is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand
the azure is black the stars shine it is formidable
he was perusing the bulletins of the grand army those heroic strophes
penned on the field of battle there at intervals he beheld his
fathers name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great
empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising
within him it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close
to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into
a singular state he thought that he heard drums cannon trumpets
the measured tread of battalions the dull and distant gallop of the
cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed
upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless
depths of space then they fell upon his book once more and there they
beheld other colossal things moving confusedly his heart contracted
within him he was in a transport trembling panting all at once
without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was
obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window
gazed intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the
eternal immensity and exclaimed long live the emperor
from that moment forth all was over the ogre of corsica the
usurper the tyrant the monster who was the lover of his own
sisters the actor who took lessons of talma the poisoner of
jaffa the tiger buonaparte all this vanished and gave place
in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an
inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar the emperor had
been for his father only the well beloved captain whom one admires for
whom one sacrifices ones self he was something more to marius he was
the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman
group in the domination of the universe he was a prodigious architect
of a destruction the continuer of charlemagne of louis xi of henry
iv of richelieu of louis xiv and of the committee of public safety
having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man
that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots
he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the
great nation he was better than that he was the very incarnation of
france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world
by the light which he shed marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre
which will always rise upon the frontier and which will guard the
future despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and
summing up a revolution napoleon became for him the man people as jesus
it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his
conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion
and he went too far his nature was so constructed once on the downward
slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag fanaticism
for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his
enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceive that along with genius
and pell mell he was admitting force that is to say that he was
installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that
which is divine on the other that which is brutal in many respects he
had set about deceiving himself otherwise he admitted everything there
is a way of encountering error while on ones way to the truth he had a
violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump in the new
path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime
as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating
at all events a tremendous step had been taken where he had formerly
beheld the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france his
orientation had changed what had been his east became the west he had
all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family
when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon
and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and
the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly
democratic and republican he went to an engraver on the quai des
orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name le baron marius
this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had
taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his
only as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any
by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his
father to the latters memory and to the things for which the
colonel had fought five and twenty years before he receded from his
grandfather we have long ago said that m gillenormands temper did
not please him there already existed between them all the dissonances
of the grave young man and the frivolous old man the gayety of geronte
shocks and exasperates the melancholy of werther so long as the same
political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both
marius had met m gillenormand there as on a bridge when the bridge
fell an abyss was formed and then over and above all marius
experienced unutterable impulses to revolt when he reflected that it
was m gillenormand who had from stupid motives torn him ruthlessly
from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child
by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at aversion
nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have
already said only he grew colder and colder laconic at meals and rare
in the house when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and
alleged his studies his lectures the examinations etc as a pretext
his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis in love
where is it that he goes off like this said his aunt
on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to
montfermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had
left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the inn keeper
thenardier thenardier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew
what had become of him marius was away from the house for four days on
he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather
they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast
under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon
he was a great grand nephew of m gillenormand on the paternal side
who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic
hearth lieutenant theodule gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions
required to make what is called a fine officer he had a ladys waist
a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache
in a hook he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that marius had
never seen him the cousins knew each other only by name we think
we have said that theodule was the favorite of aunt gillenormand who
preferred him because she did not see him not seeing people permits one
one morning mademoiselle gillenormand the elder returned to her
apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing
marius had just asked his grandfathers permission to take a little
trip adding that he meant to set out that very evening go had been
his grandfathers reply and m gillenormand had added in an aside as
he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead here he is passing
the night out again mademoiselle gillenormand had ascended to
her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this
exclamation this is too much and this interrogation but where is
it that he goes she espied some adventure of the heart more or less
illicit a woman in the shadow a rendezvous a mystery and she would
not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair tasting a
mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted souls
do not detest this there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret
so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history
in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond
her wont she took refuge in her talents and set about scalloping
with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the
empire and the restoration in which there are numerous cart wheels
the work was clumsy the worker cross she had been seated at this for
several hours when the door opened mademoiselle gillenormand raised
her nose lieutenant theodule stood before her making the regulation
salute she uttered a cry of delight one may be old one may be a
prude one may be pious one may be an aunt but it is always agreeable
and he kissed her aunt gillenormand went to her writing desk and opened
you will remain with us a week at least
my heart says yes but my orders say no the matter is simple
they are changing our garrison we have been at melun we are being
transferred to gaillon it is necessary to pass through paris in order
to get from the old post to the new one i said i am going to see my
and she put ten louis into his hand
for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt
theodule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of
the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform
are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment she asked
no aunt i wanted to see you i have special permission my servant is
taking my horse i am travelling by diligence and by the way i want
is my cousin marius pontmercy travelling so too
how do you know that said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick
on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe
a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial i saw
the wicked fellow exclaimed his aunt ah your cousin is not a
steady lad like yourself to think that he is to pass the night in a
but you it is your duty in his case it is wildness
here an event occurred to mademoiselle gillenormand the elder an idea
struck her if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow she
are you aware whether your cousin knows you
no i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me
he in the imperial i in the coupe
unless like myself he should stop on the way i get down at vernon
in order to take the branch coach for gaillon i know nothing of marius
marius what an ugly name what possessed them to name him marius
i would rather be called alfred said the officer
we should like to know what there is behind all this
theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze
and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added
that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m
gillenormand speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible
at that word fillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by
do us a favor follow marius a little he does not know you it will be
easy since a lass there is try to get a sight of her you must write
us the tale it will amuse his grandfather
theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much
touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible
sequel he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt
and he added in an aside to himself here i am a duenna
you are not the man to play such pranks theodule you obey discipline
you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you
would not quit your family to go and see a creature
the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his
marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence
without suspecting that he was watched as for the watcher the
first thing he did was to fall asleep his slumber was complete and
at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted vernon relay of
vernon travellers for vernon and lieutenant theodule woke
good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out
then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he
recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had
undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius this set
perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as he rebuttoned the
waistcoat of his undress uniform he may have stopped at poissy he may
have stopped at triel if he did not get out at meulan he may have got
out at mantes unless he got out at rolleboise or if he did not go on
as far as pacy with the choice of turning to the left at evreus or to
the right at laroche guyon run after him aunty what the devil am i to
at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial
made its appearance at the window of the coupe
a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilions
at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers give
marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat
come now said theodule leaping down from the coupe this piques my
curiosity who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to she
must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet i want to see
and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like
dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius
marius paid no attention to theodule elegant women descended from the
diligence he did not glance at them he seemed to see nothing around
he is pretty deeply in love thought theodule
capital said theodule to himself rendezvous seasoned with a bit of
mass are the best sort nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes
on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the
apse he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse
the rendezvous is appointed outside said theodule lets have a look
and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius
marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the
grass on a grave he had strewn his bouquet there at the extremity of
the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood
a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron
it was hither that marius had come on the first occasion of his
absenting himself from paris it was hither that he had come every time
that m gillenormand had said he is sleeping out
lieutenant theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this
unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and
disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which
was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the
colonel he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and
there was discipline in this retreat death appeared to him with large
epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him not knowing
what to write to his aunt he decided not to write at all and it is
probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made
by theodule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those
mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at
vernon had not had an almost immediate counter shock at paris
marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the
morning descended at his grandfathers door and wearied by the two
nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his
loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming school he mounted rapidly to
his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his travelling coat
and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the
m gillenormand who had risen betimes like all old men in good health
had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his
old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived
in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find
but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to
ascend and when father gillenormand entered the attic marius was no
the bed had not been disturbed and on the bed lay outspread but not
defiantly the great coat and the black ribbon
and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where
mademoiselle gillenormand was already seated busily embroidering her
m gillenormand held in one hand the great coat and in the other the
victory we are about to penetrate the mystery we are going to
learn the most minute details we are going to lay our finger on the
debaucheries of our sly friend here we have the romance itself i have
in fact a case of black shagreen resembling a medallion portrait was
the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening
it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor
hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass
for this evidently is a portrait i know all about such things that is
worn tenderly on the heart how stupid they are some abominable fright
that will make us shudder probably young men have such bad taste
let us see father said the old spinster
the case opened by the pressure of a spring they found in it nothing
from the same to the same said m gillenormand bursting with
laughter i know what it is a billet doux
ah let us read it said the aunt
and she put on her spectacles they unfolded the paper and read as
for my son the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of
waterloo since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i
purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will
be worthy of it is a matter of course
the feelings of father and daughter cannot be described they felt
chilled as by the breath of a deaths head they did not exchange a
only m gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to
the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put
at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell
from one of the pockets of the great coat mademoiselle gillenormand
picked it up and unfolded the blue paper
it contained marius hundred cards she handed one of them to m
the old man rang the bell nicolette came m gillenormand took the
ribbon the case and the coat flung them all on the floor in the
a full hour passed in the most profound silence the old man and the old
spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other and were
thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability
at the expiration of this hour aunt gillenormand said a pretty state
a few moments later marius made his appearance he entered even before
he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of
his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter
exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was
well well well well well so you are a baron now i present you my
it means that i am the son of my father
m gillenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly
my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was
a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously
who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who
lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath grape shot and
bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two
flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and
who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two
this was more than m gillenormand could bear to hear at the word
republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet
every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the
old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing
brand from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from
marius he cried abominable child i do not know what your father
was i do not wish to know i know nothing about that and i do not know
him but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels
among those men they were all rascals assassins red caps thieves i
say all i say all i know not one i say all do you hear me marius
see here you are no more a baron than my slipper is they were all
bandits in the service of robespierre all who served b u o naparte were
brigands they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their
legitimate king all cowards who fled before the prussians and the
english at waterloo that is what i do know whether monsieur your
father comes in that category i do not know i am sorry for it so much
in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and m gillenormand
who was the bellows marius quivered in every limb he did not know what
would happen next his brain was on fire he was the priest who beholds
all his sacred wafers cast to the winds the fakir who beholds a
passer by spit upon his idol it could not be that such things had been
uttered in his presence what was he to do his father had just been
trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom by
his grandfather how was he to avenge the one without outraging the
other it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was
equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged on the one
hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks
he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated
with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised
his eyes gazed fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of
down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii
louis xviii had been dead for four years but it was all the same to
the old man who had been crimson turned whiter than his hair he
wheeled round towards a bust of m le duc de berry which stood on the
chimney piece and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty
then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the
window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length
of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a
on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this
encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her
with a smile that was almost calm a baron like this gentleman and a
bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof
and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with
his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he
extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him
on the following day m gillenormand said to his daughter
you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood drinker
and you will never mention his name to me
having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing
what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead
marius on his side had gone forth in indignation there was one
circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation
there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic
dramas they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality
the wrongs are not increased by them while carrying marius duds
precipitately to his chamber at his grandfathers command nicolette
had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which
was dark that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper
penned by the colonel neither paper nor case could afterwards be found
marius was convinced that monsieur gillenormand from that day forth
he never alluded to him otherwise had flung his fathers testament in
the fire he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written
and consequently nothing was lost but the paper the writing that
sacred relic all that was his very heart what had been done with it
marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and
without knowing where with thirty francs his watch and a few clothes
in a hand bag he had entered a hackney coach had engaged it by the
hour and had directed his course at hap hazard towards the latin

at that epoch which was to all appearances indifferent a certain
revolutionary quiver was vaguely current breaths which had started
forth from the depths of 89 and 93 were in the air youth was on
the point may the reader pardon us the word of moulting people were
undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it
through the movement of the age the needle which moves round the
compass also moves in souls each person was taking that step in advance
which he was bound to take the royalists were becoming liberals
liberals were turning democrats it was a flood tide complicated with
a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create
intermixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people
adored both napoleon and liberty we are making history here these
were the mirages of that period opinions traverse phases voltairian
royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist
other groups of minds were more serious in that direction they
sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they
grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite
realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards
the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing
like dogma for bringing forth dreams and there is nothing like dreams
for engendering the future utopia to day flesh and blood to morrow
these advanced opinions had a double foundation a beginning of mystery
menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and
underhand a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree the
second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in
the mine the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the
there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying
organizations like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism but
here and there there were dark underminings which were in process of
throwing off shoots the cougourde was being outlined at aix there
existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society
