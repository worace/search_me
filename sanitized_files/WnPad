natasha he said you know that i love you but
you are in love with me natasha broke in
yes i am but please dont let us do like that in another four
years then i will ask for your hand
thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender
a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face
forever said the little girl till death itself
she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have a
tte  tte talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna
mikhaylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
petersburg anna mikhaylovna with her tear worn but pleasant face drew
her chair nearer to that of the countess
with you i will be quite frank said anna mikhaylovna there are not
many left of us old friends thats why i so value your friendship
anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused the countess pressed her
vera she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
favorite how is it you have so little tact dont you see you are not
wanted here go to the other girls or
the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt
if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as
she rose to go to her own room
but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one
pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya was
sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the
first he had ever written boris and natasha were at the other window
and ceased talking when vera entered sonya and natasha looked at vera
it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but
apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera
how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you have
a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas
in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen
you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued vera you
came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of
though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one
replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the
and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris or
now vera what does it matter to you said natasha in defense
she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
very silly said vera i am ashamed of you secrets indeed
all have secrets of their own answered natasha getting warmer we
i should think not said vera because there can never be anything
wrong in my behavior but ill just tell mamma how you are behaving with
natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked boris i have
dont boris you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said
natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she used the word
diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the
special sense they attached to it why does she bother me and she
added turning to vera youll never understand it because youve
never loved anyone you have no heart you are a madame de genlis and
nothing more this nickname bestowed on vera by nicholas was
considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be
unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you please she
i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors
well now youve done what you wanted put in nicholas said
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them lets go to the nursery
all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room
the unpleasant things were said to me remarked vera i said none to
madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through
the handsome vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect
on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her
went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf looking at
her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer
in the drawing room the conversation was still going on
ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either
dont i know that at the rate we are living our means wont last long
its all the club and his easygoing nature even in the country do we
get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides but
dont lets talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often
wonder at you annette how at your age you can rush off alone in a
carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and great people
and know how to deal with them all its quite astonishing how did you
get things settled i couldnt possibly do it
ah my love answered anna mikhaylovna god grant you never know what
it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to
distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain
pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those big
people i write a note princess so and so desires an interview with so
and so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or four times
till i get what i want i dont mind what they think of me
well and to whom did you apply about bory asked the countess you
see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas is
going as a cadet theres no one to interest himself for him to whom
to prince vasili he was so kind he at once agreed to everything and
put the matter before the emperor said princess anna mikhaylovna
enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured
has prince vasili aged much asked the countess i have not seen him
since we acted together at the rumyantsovs theatricals i expect he has
forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said the countess
he is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna overflowing
with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to
me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your
command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but
nataly you know my love for my son i would do anything for his
happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now
a terrible one continued anna mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice
my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you
believe it i have literally not a penny and dont know how to equip
boris she took out her handkerchief and began to cry i need five
hundred rubles and have only one twenty five ruble note i am in such a
state my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov if
he will not assist his godson you know he is borys godfather and
allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been
thrown away i shall not be able to equip him
the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence
i often think though perhaps its a sin said the princess that
here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all alone that
tremendous fortune and what is his life worth its a burden to him
surely he will leave something to boris said the countess
heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish still
i will take boris and go to see him at once and i shall speak to him
straight out let people think what they will of me its really all the
same to me when my sons fate is at stake the princess rose its now
two oclock and you dine at four there will just be time
and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
time anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the
good bye my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door
and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me good
are you going to count cyril vladimirovich my dear said the count
coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added if he
is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the house you
know and danced with the children be sure to invite him my dear we
will see how taras distinguishes himself today he says count orlov
never gave such a dinner as ours will be
my dear boris said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son as countess
rostovas carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw
covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril
vladimirovich bezukhovs house my dear boris said the mother
drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and
tenderly on her sons arm be affectionate and attentive to him count
cyril vladimirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on
him remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how
if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it
answered her son coldly but i have promised and will do it for your
although the hall porter saw someones carriage standing at the
entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the ladys old
cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and
hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse
today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone
we may as well go back said the son in french
my dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him
boris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
my friend said anna mikhaylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall
porter i know count cyril vladimirovich is very ill thats why i
have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him my friend i
only need see prince vasili sergeevich he is staying here is he not
the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned
princess drubetskaya to see prince vasili sergeevich he called to a
footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a swallow tail coat who
ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing
the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
venetian mirror in the wall and in her trodden down shoes briskly
my dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch
the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly
they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the
just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were
about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasili
came out wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was
his custom when at home taking leave of a good looking dark haired
man this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain
prince humanum est errare  but replied the doctor swallowing
his rs and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent
seeing anna mikhaylovna and her son prince vasili dismissed the doctor
with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry the
son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his
ah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is our
dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look
prince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed
boris bowed politely prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned
to anna mikhaylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and
lips indicating very little hope for the patient
is it possible exclaimed anna mikhaylovna oh how awful it is
terrible to think this is my son she added indicating boris he
believe me prince a mothers heart will never forget what you have
i am glad i was able to do you a service my dear anna mikhaylovna
said prince vasili arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner
here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an
obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done
try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing boris
with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went on in his
i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied
boris betraying neither annoyance at the princes brusque manner nor a
desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and
respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance
i am living at countess rostovas replied boris again adding your
that is with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina said anna
i know i know answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice i
never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that
unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too
but a very kind man prince said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic
smile as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure
but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man what do the
doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again
and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and
boris he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact
prince vasili became thoughtful and frowned anna mikhaylovna saw that
he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhovs fortune
if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle said
she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern i know
his character noble upright but you see he has no one with him
except the young princesses they are still young she bent her
head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty
prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no
worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill we
women prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these
things i absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me i
evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done
at anna pavlovnas that it would be difficult to get rid of anna
would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear anna mikhaylovna
said he let us wait until evening the doctors are expecting a
but one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the
welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a
a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the
counts niece entered with a cold stern face the length of her body
was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vasili turned
still the same but what can you expect this noise said the
princess looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger
ah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikhaylovna with a happy
smile ambling lightly up to the counts niece i have come and am at
your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone
through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes
the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room as
anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had
conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasili to take a
boris she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the
count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and
dont forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask him to
dinner i suppose he wont go she continued turning to the prince
on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed
i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here
he is and the count has not once asked for him
he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight of
pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in
petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to moscow the story told about him at count rostovs was true
pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been
for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers house
though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known
in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably
disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him
he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part of
the house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of
their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at
embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was
reading the one who had met anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones were
embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that
one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre
was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess
paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes
the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest
the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition
bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene
she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely
able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the
how do you do cousin said pierre you dont recognize me
i recognize you only too well too well
how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but
the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have
done your best to increase his mental sufferings
can i see the count pierre again asked
hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see
him olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is ready it is almost
time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and
busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only
olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and
said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see
and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the counts house he
sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to
behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is
all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not
since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room
stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall
as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely
over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering
england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at
someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights
of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that moment
imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the
dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could
pronounce pitts sentence he saw a well built and handsome young
officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when boris
was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual
impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly
do you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile i have
come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well
yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered
pierre trying to remember who this young man was
boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least
count rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after a
ah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son
ilya only fancy i didnt know you at first do you remember how we
went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot its such an age
you are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold and slightly
sarcastic smile i am boris son of princess anna mikhaylovna
drubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son is nicholas i
pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees
oh dear what am i thinking about ive mixed everything up one has so
many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well now we know
where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the
english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the
channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve
boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the
papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves name
we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing
about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with
gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your
pierre smiled in his good natured way as if afraid for his companions
sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but
boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into
moscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went on everybody is
wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may
perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will
yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid
pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
and it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but not
changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is
trying to get something out of the rich man
but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite
mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very
poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your
father is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his and neither
i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him
for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped
up from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy way
and blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feeling of
well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know
i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you
must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at
ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a
rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to
and boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it
no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow
what you have just said is good very good of course you dont know me
we have not met for such a long time not since we were children you
might think that i i understand quite understand i could not have
done it myself i should not have had the courage but its splendid i
am very glad to have made your acquaintance its queer he added after
a pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh well
what of it i hope well get better acquainted and he pressed boris
hand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has not
sent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do
and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked
pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
a footman came in to summon boris the princess was going pierre in
order to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinner
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
into boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down
the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his
imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant
as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely
life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
prince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes
it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may i
shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be left
like this every moment is precious i cant think why his nieces put it
off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him adieu
adieu ma bonne answered prince vasili turning away from her
oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they
were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody
i dont understand mamma what is his attitude to pierre asked the
the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it
but why do you expect that he will leave us anything
ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor
well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma
oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother
after anna mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril
vladimirovich bezukhov countess rostova sat for a long time all alone
applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang
what is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who
kept her waiting some minutes dont you wish to serve me then ill
the countess was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating poverty
and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always
found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with
i am very sorry maam answered the maid
the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
well little countess what a saute of game au madere we are to have
my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for taras were not ill
he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
you see my dear whats that mess she said pointing to his
waistcoat its the saute most likely she added with a smile well
oh little countess and the count began bustling to get out his
i want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking out
her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbands waistcoat
yes immediately immediately hey whos there he called out in a
tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush
to obey the summons send dmitri to me
dmitri a man of good family who had been brought up in the counts
house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room
this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential
young man who had entered bring me he reflected a moment yes
bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind dont bring me such
tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the
yes dmitri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply
when would you like them your excellency asked dmitri allow me to
inform you but dont be uneasy he added noticing that the count
was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of
approaching anger i was forgetting do you wish it brought at once
yes yes just so bring it give it to the countess
what a treasure that dmitri is added the count with a smile when the
young man had departed there is never any impossible with him
thats a thing i hate everything is possible
ah money count money how much sorrow it causes in the world said
the countess but i am in great need of this sum
you my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count
and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study
when anna mikhaylovna returned from count bezukhovs the money all in
clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess
little table and anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating
oh what a terrible state he is in one would not know him he is so
ill i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word
annette for heavens sake dont refuse me the countess began with a
blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and
she took the money from under the handkerchief
anna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready
to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment
this is for boris from me for his outfit
anna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess
wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were
kindhearted and because they friends from childhood had to think
about such a base thing as money and because their youth was over
but those tears were pleasant to them both
countess rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests was
already seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen into
his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes from
time to time he went out to ask hasnt she come yet they were
expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as le terrible
dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common
sense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was known to the
imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both cities
wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good
stories about her while none the less all without exception respected
in the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war
that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting none
of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared
the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and
talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one
side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and
listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on
one of them was a sallow clean shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable
young man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelor
shinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they
said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his companion
the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed
brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with
red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome
mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an officer in the semenov
regiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army and about whom
natasha had teased her elder sister vera speaking of berg as her
intended the count sat between them and listened attentively his
favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very
fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting
well then old chap mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich said
shinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian
expressions with the choicest french phrases which was a peculiarity of
his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur letat  you want
 you expect to make an income out of the government
no peter nikolaevich i only want to show that in the cavalry the
advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own
berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his
conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put
out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon
as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
consider my position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry i should
get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the
rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty said
he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as
if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief
besides that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guards i shall
be in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies occur
much more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can be
done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a little
aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke
la balance y est  a german knows how to skin a flint as the
proverb says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other side of
the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshin was
talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference
continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already
gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime the
company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company
might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in
the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently
enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others
too might have their own interests but all he said was so prettily
sedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he
well my boy youll get along wherever you go foot or horse that
ill warrant said shinshin patting him on the shoulder and taking his
berg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into the drawing
it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests
expecting the summons to zakuska  avoid engaging in any long
conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to
show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host and
hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another
and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are
waiting for some important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish
pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across
blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk but
he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search
of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he was in
the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of the
guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at
this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow
could have played such a prank on a policeman
you have only lately arrived the countess asked him
you have been in paris recently i believe i suppose its very
the countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna the latter
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he
answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other
guests were all conversing with one another the razumovskis it was
charming you are very kind countess apraksina was heard on all
sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom
herself came the answer in a rough voice and marya dmitrievna
all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
oldest rose marya dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stout
holding high her fifty year old head with its gray curls she stood
surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
rolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian
health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
children she said in her loud full toned voice which drowned all
others well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who
was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere
to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just see how
these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls you must
look for husbands for them whether you like it or not
well said she hows my cossack marya dmitrievna always called
natasha a cossack and she stroked the childs arm as she came up
fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know shes a scamp of a girl but
she took a pair of pear shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and
having given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasure of
her saints day fete turned away at once and addressed herself to
eh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone
of voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her
sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlike
come nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tell
your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case its my
evident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was to
follow for this was clearly only a prelude
a fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and
he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sir
for shame it would be better if you went to the war
she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep
well i suppose it is time we were at table said marya dmitrievna
the count went in first with marya dmitrievna the countess followed on
the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because
nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikhaylovna
with shinshin berg gave his arm to vera the smiling julie karagina
went in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling the
whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses
followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the
band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their
places then the strains of the counts household band were replaced by
the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft
steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess with
marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left the
other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count
with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male
visitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat the
grownup young people vera beside berg and pierre beside boris and on
the other side the children tutors and governesses from behind the
crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife
and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons and busily filled his
neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn
without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from
behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by
their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at the
ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the
mens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the
colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so
much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests berg
with tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a
heavenly feeling boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guests
were and exchanging glances with natasha who was sitting opposite
pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal of
the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the
game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latter
the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind
the next mans shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarian
or rhine wine as the case might be of the four crystal glasses
engraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate pierre
held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with ever
increasing amiability at the other guests natasha who sat opposite
was looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in
love with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes that same
look fell on pierre and that funny lively little girls look made him
nicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina to whom
he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya wore a
company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned
pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and
julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking round
uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
children the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines
and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner
to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler
with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying to
appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because
no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for
at the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animated the
colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commander in chief
and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshin
he has stopped austrias cackle and i fear it will be our turn next
the colonel was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to
the service and patriotically russian he resented shinshins remark
it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german
