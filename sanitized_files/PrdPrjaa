it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she
do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he
is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or
five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are
as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five
grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
it is more than i engage for i assure you
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to
go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no
newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the
others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so
good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you
take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they
are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration
ah you do not know what i suffer
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind
was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding
little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented
she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her
daughters married its solace was visiting and news
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother
but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the
assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him
i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces
of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little
compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly
very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all
mrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore as
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will
the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you
mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read
mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before if
i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called
on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should
persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a
now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and
as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness
or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but
for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are
the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five
daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him
in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at
last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been
delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely
agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield
said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well
married i shall have nothing to wish for
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had
heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already
had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable
to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite
disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get
a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and
mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant
countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women
with an air of decided fashion his brother in law mr hurst merely
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be
proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all
his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance
was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving
one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being
introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party
his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man
in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit
down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for a
kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i
dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at
elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said
she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles for you are wasting your time with me
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been
distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes
pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they
were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with
a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that his wifes views on
the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most
delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there
jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well
she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with
her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her
twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody
can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and
asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king
and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again
and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger 
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently
he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of
his partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance
oh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively
handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs
here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any
description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at
all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very
great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my
dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in
her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible
good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much
he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between
us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what
could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is
very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general
you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak
i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your
good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others affectation of candour is common enough one meets with it
everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the
good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing
of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters
too do you their manners are not equal to his
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she
was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine
ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and
conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of
associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of
a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an
estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to
his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but
though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for
half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of
great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley
had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion
in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means
deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty
reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not
inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received
either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired
her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one
whom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town
and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and
unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him
supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by
nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest
of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil
self command to miss lucas you were mr bingleys first choice
yes but he seemed to like his second better
oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be
sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he
did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not
i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his
answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point
upon my word well that is very decided indeed that does seem as
if but however it may all come to nothing you know
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said
charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend
is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his
ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
are you quite sure maam is not there a little mistake said jane
i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he
could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much
unless among his intimate acquaintances with them he is remarkably
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it
was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to
i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him
i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride
often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour
should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive
his pride if he had not mortified mine
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have
ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human
nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some
quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different
things though the words are often used synonymously a person may
be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with
his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of
foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she
would and the argument ended only with the visit
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit
was soon returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to
a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards
the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them
though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it
was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and
to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a
way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane
united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all
begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more
affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he
may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can
perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined
to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but
these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four
dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house
and has since dined with him in company four times this is not quite
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together and four
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other
leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and
if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the
least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not
sound and that you would never act in this way yourself
occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of
this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing
with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so
drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she
did you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly
well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
with great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady
it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going
to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken
a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however
she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing
at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of
course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song
or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her
application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with
much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the
end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who
with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there
is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first
certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance
sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he
continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
you have a house in town i conclude
i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself for i am fond
of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed
to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to
my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing mr darcy you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you
cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though
extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly
drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling
he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza
we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a
elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some
i can guess the subject of your reverie
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the
nothingness and yet the self importance of all those people what would
i give to hear your strictures on them
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more
agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment
how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love
to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy
nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled you will be having a charming mother in law indeed
and of course she will always be at pemberley with you
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe her wit flowed long
mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed
in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers
fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply
the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and
she had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family
catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing
better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news
the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the
their visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a
secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr
phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and
mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation
to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect
indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly
of anybodys children it should not be of my own however
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it
yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when
i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my
heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year
should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in
mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
