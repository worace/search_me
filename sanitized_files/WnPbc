christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and
wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the
new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though
the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day
and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the
inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time
of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning
was asleep on the sitting room sofa the old count was resting in his
study sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a
design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastasya
ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
ladies natasha came into the room went up to sonya glanced at what
she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without
why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother what
him i want him now this minute i want him said natasha with
glittering eyes and no sign of a smile
the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter
dont look at me mamma dont look i shall cry directly
sit down with me a little said the countess
mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma
her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to
she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then
went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a
young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from
stop playing theres a time for everything said the old woman
let her alone kondratevna said natasha go mavrushka go
having released mavrushka natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to
the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing
cards they broke off and rose as she entered
what can i do with them thought natasha
oh nikita please go where can i send him yes go to the yard
and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some oats
just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily
go go quickly the old man urged him
and you theodore get me a piece of chalk
on her way past the butlers pantry she told them to set a samovar
though it was not at all the time for tea
foka the butler was the most ill tempered person in the house natasha
liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and asked
oh dear what a young lady said foka pretending to frown at natasha
no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
natasha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send
them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would
get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no ones orders so
readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought she
nastasya ivanovna what sort of children shall i have she asked the
buffoon who was coming toward her in a womans jacket
o lord o lord its always the same oh where am i to go what am i
to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs
to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story
two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were
plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing
whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha sat down
listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got
the island of madagascar she said ma da gas car she repeated
articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madame
schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room
her brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he
was preparing fireworks to let off that night
petya petya she called to him carry me downstairs
petya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her
arms round his neck and he pranced along with her
no dont the island of madagascar she said and jumping off his
having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure
that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natasha
betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark
corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings
in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had
heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitar
would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a
whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind
the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the
pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood for
sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natasha glanced at
her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she
remembered the light falling through that crack once before and sonya
passing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the same thought
sonya what is this she cried twanging a thick string
oh you are there said sonya with a start and came near and
listened i dont know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of being
there thats just how she started and just how she came up smiling
timidly when all this happened before thought natasha and in just
the same way i thought there was something lacking in her
no its the chorus from the water carrier listen and natasha sang
the air of the chorus so that sonya should catch it where were you
to change the water in this glass i am just finishing the design
you always find something to do but i cant said natasha and
sonya go and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come and
she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting
not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
with him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyes
oh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never be
and worst of all i am growing old thats the thing there wont then
be in me what there is now but perhaps hell come today will come
immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room
perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose put down
the guitar and went to the drawing room
all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already
at the tea table the servants stood round the table but prince andrew
was not there and life was going on as before
ah here she is said the old count when he saw natasha enter well
sit down by me but natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as
mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly
quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs
she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god
the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the
same way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the
after tea nicholas sonya and natasha went to the sitting room to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began
does it ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when they
settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as
if there were nothing more to come nothing that everything good is
past and to feel not exactly dull but sad
i should think so he replied i have felt like that when everything
was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my
mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die once
in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was
oh yes i know i know i know natasha interrupted him when i was
quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i was
punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbing
in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for
everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocent that was the
i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you
afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed
to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give
and do you remember natasha asked with a pensive smile how once
long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into the
study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and
a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course i
remember even now i dont know whether there really was a negro or if
we only dreamed it or were told about him
he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at
yes yes i do remember something too sonya answered timidly
you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natasha
and they say there was no negro at all but you see you remember
of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them
how strange it is its as if it were a dream i like that
and do you remember how we rolled hard boiled eggs in the ballroom and
suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that real
or not do you remember what fun it was
yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the
so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad
memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those impressions of
ones most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they
sonya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared
much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she
recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she
simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it
she only really took part when they recalled sonyas first arrival she
told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded
jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with
and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a
cabbage said natasha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it
then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable
while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper
it isnt wanted petya tell them to take it away replied natasha
in the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its cloth
covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound
mr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the old
dimmler struck a chord and turning to natasha nicholas and sonya
yes were philosophizing said natasha glancing round for a moment
and then continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreams
dimmler began to play natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table
took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly
in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they were
sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of
the full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but
still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently
uncertain whether to stop or to play something else
do you know said natasha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and
sonya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at last
begins to remember what happened before one was in the world
that is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well and
remembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have lived
in animals and will go back into animals again
no i dont believe we ever were in animals said natasha still in a
whisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that we were
angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we
may i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down
if we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas no
not lower who said we were lower how do i know what i was before
natasha rejoined with conviction the soul is immortal well then if i
shall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole eternity
yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler who
had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
why is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now today
and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the
natasha now its your turn sing me something they heard the
countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators
mamma i dont at all want to replied natasha but all the same she
none of them not even the middle aged dimmler wanted to break off
their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natasha
got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in the
middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best
natasha began to sing her mothers favorite song
she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had
sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the
count from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her and
like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk
while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenka
stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take
his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sonya as she
listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself
and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she
thought of natasha and of her own youth and of how there was something
unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and prince
dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with
ah countess he said at last thats a european talent she has
nothing to learn what softness tenderness and strength
ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess not
realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that
natasha had too much of something and that because of this she would
not be happy before natasha had finished singing fourteen year old
petya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived
idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw
herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
its nothing mamma really its nothing only petya startled me she
said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked
the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks
innkeepers and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them the
cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly
into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the
ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and
heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games
the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their
costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom
smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had
half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas a turkish
girl was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and a
circassian was sonya with burnt cork mustache and eyebrows
after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those
who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their
costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere
nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take
them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a
dozen of the serf mummers and drive to uncles
no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides you
wouldnt have room to turn round there if you must go go to the
melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and
thats right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused
ill dress up at once and go with them ill make pashette open her
but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all
these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if
louisa ivanovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies
might go to the melyukovs sonya generally so timid and shy more
urgently than anyone begging louisa ivanovna not to refuse
sonyas costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were
extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some
inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in
her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa ivanovna
consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow
natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing
from one to another grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to
two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the
old counts with a trotter from the orlov stud as shaft horse the
fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse
nicholas in his old ladys dress over which he had belted his hussar
overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand
it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm
at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof
natasha sonya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas sleigh
dimmler his wife and petya into the old counts and the rest of the
mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs
you go ahead zakhar shouted nicholas to his fathers coachman
wishing for a chance to race past him
the old counts troyka with dimmler and his party started forward
squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its deep toned
bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the
middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar
nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others
moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady
trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows
of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain
bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the
first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the
other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the frost
bound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after
a hares track a lot of tracks rang out natashas voice through the
how light it is nicholas came sonyas voice
nicholas glanced round at sonya and bent down to see her face closer
quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the moonlight
that used to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer and
nothing said he and turned again to the horses
when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners
and cut up by rough shod hoofs the marks of which were visible in the
moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking
into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from
side to side moving his ears as if asking isnt it time to begin
now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could be
clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the
gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one side
it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that one
noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with
screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and
nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river
where are we thought he its the kosoy meadow i suppose but no
this is something new ive never seen before this isnt the kosoy
meadow nor the demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is it is
something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting
to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh
zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already
nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his arms
clucked his tongue and let his horses go
faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the
feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead zakhar
while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins
nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the horses
showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside
them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing the
whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still
surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the
left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is this
melyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what
is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is
look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the
strange pretty unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and
i think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was
madame schoss but perhaps its not and this circassian with the
mustache i dont know but i love her
they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind
shouted something probably something funny but they could not make out
but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of
diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really
melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came
who is it asked someone in the porch
the mummers from the counts i know by the horses replied some
pelageya danilovna melyukova a broadly built energetic woman wearing
spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her
daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they were
quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax
figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and voices of
hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their
throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule came
into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the clown
dimmler and the lady nicholas started a dance surrounded by the
screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising
their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the
dear me theres no recognizing them and natasha see whom she looks
like she really reminds me of somebody but herr dimmler isnt he
good i didnt know him and how he dances dear me theres a
circassian really how becoming it is to dear sonya and who is that
well you have cheered us up nikita and vanya clear away the tables
and we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar
just like a boy and the legs i cant look at him different
natasha the young melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into the
back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
behind the door ten minutes later all the young melyukovs joined the
pelageya danilovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the
visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs
went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering
into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of
them it was not merely dimmler and the rostovs she failed to recognize
she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late husbands
dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on
and who is this she asked her governess peering into the face of her
own daughter dressed up as a kazan tartar i suppose it is one of the
rostovs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve in she asked
natasha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk she ordered the
butler who was handing things round thats not forbidden by his law
sometimes as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
dancers who having decided once for all that being disguised no one
would recognize them were not at all shy pelageya danilovna hid her
face in her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with
my little sasha look at sasha she said
after russian country dances and chorus dances pelageya danilovna made
the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a
silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together
in an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked
eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed and
merry faces pelageya danilovna began to recognize the mummers admired
their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they suited the
young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained her so
well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room and the
serfs had something served to them in the ballroom
now to tell ones fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening said
an old maid who lived with the melyukovs during supper
tell what happened to the young lady said the second melyukov girl
well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a cock
laid the table for two all properly and sat down after sitting a
while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with
harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a
man like an officer comes in and sits down to table with her
ah ah screamed natasha rolling her eyes with horror
yes like a man everything quite all right and he began persuading
her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got
frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then he
caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then
mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter
and how does one do it in a barn inquired sonya
well say you went to the barn now and listened it depends on what
you hear hammering and knocking thats bad but a sound of shifting
grain is good and one sometimes hears that too
mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn
oh ive forgotten she replied but none of you would go
yes i will pelageya danilovna let me ill go said sonya
whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
talking as now nicholas did not leave sonyas side and gazed at her
with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks to
that burnt cork mustache that he had fully learned to know her and
really that evening sonya was brighter more animated and prettier
so thats what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazing
at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile
dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before
im not afraid of anything said sonya may i go at once she got
they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen
and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head and
what a darling that girl is thought he and what have i been
sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went hastily
to the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people really
outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even
brighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
stars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth was
i am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought nicholas
and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and
along the path that led to the back porch he knew sonya would pass that
way halfway lay some snow covered piles of firewood and across and
along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the
snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log walls of the
barn and its snow covered roof that looked as if hewn out of some
precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snapped
with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosom
seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness
from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the
bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
the voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the
i am not afraid answered sonyas voice and along the path toward
nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of sonyas feet in her thin
sonya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces
away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had
known and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress with
tousled hair and a happy smile new to sonya she ran rapidly toward him
quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her
face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her
on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sonya
kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed
sonya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and
then back again re entering he by the front and she by the back porch
when they all drove back from pelageya danilovnas natasha who always
saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss should
go back in the sleigh with dimmler and sonya with nicholas and the
on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
kept peering by that fantastic all transforming light into sonyas face
and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his
present sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again he
looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sonya and being
reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss
inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground
flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in
sonya is it well with thee he asked from time to time
when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
a moment to natashas sleigh and stood on its wing
natasha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mind
have you told her asked natasha suddenly beaming all over with joy
oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows
i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did not
tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has
nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while
sonya was not continued natasha now i am so glad well run back to
no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering
into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and
bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natasha its
had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should long
ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and
so you are glad and i have done right
oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it
mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i
nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of
sonya for there is nothing but good in her
then its all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expression
of his sisters face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down
and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same
happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up
from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassian
was sonya and that sonya was certainly his future happy and loving
when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
evening at the melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom when they
had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a
long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live
when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how
happy they would be on natashas table stood two looking glasses which
only when will all that be i am afraid never it would be too
good said natasha rising and going to the looking glasses
sit down natasha perhaps youll see him said sonya
natasha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking glasses
i see someone with a mustache said natasha seeing her own face
with sonyas help and the maids natasha got the glass she held into
the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious
expression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the
receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from
tales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in that
last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take the
smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing
she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses
why is it others see things and i dont she said you sit down now
sonya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel so
sonya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began
now miss sonya is sure to see something whispered dunyasha while
i know she will she saw something last year
of course she will whispered natasha but did not finish suddenly
sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with
did you see did you what was it exclaimed natasha holding up the
sonya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up
when she heard natasha say of course she will she did not wish to
disappoint either dunyasha or natasha but it was hard to sit still she
did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she
you saw him urged natasha seizing her hand
yes wait a bit i saw him sonya could not help saying not yet
knowing whom natasha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew
but why shouldnt i say i saw something others do see besides who can
tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through sonyas mind
no i saw at first there was nothing then i saw him lying down
andrew lying is he ill asked natasha her frightened eyes fixed on
no on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and he
turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really
after that i could not make out what there was something blue and
sonya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how afraid
i am for him and for myself and about everything natasha began and
without replying to sonyas words of comfort she got into bed and long
after her candle was out lay open eyed and motionless gazing at the
soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love
for sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who had
long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage nicholas for the first time
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her love
for him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son she
sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to
inform him of the facts in her sons presence but unable to restrain
herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room the old
count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his
purpose nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and his
father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and
went in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sonya on this occasion he
was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
been in disorder no better wife for nicholas than sonya could have been
wished for and that no one but himself with his mitenka and his
uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again
but a few days later the countess sent for sonya and with a cruelty
neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch
nicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with downcast eyes
to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of
her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors self
sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see
what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could not help loving the
countess and the whole rostov family but neither could she help loving
nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love she was
silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be
intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he first
implored her to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriage
then he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry her
the countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before
replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without his
fathers consent and he could do the same but that she would never
exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told his
mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but he
had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have
forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it
for natasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at
nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i
tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice
mamma darling its not at all so my poor sweet darling she said
to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a
rupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and
excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way
nicholas ill explain to you go away listen mamma darling said
her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she
the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughters breast
while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room
natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded
that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should not
be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment to
retire from the army and return and marry sonya nicholas serious
sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him
passionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his
after nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were more
depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation
sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on
account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
her the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
