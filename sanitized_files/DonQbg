do him a service on the condition that he was to return them to me
whenever i should ask for them a long time passed before i asked for
them for i would not put him to any greater straits to return them than
he was in when i lent them to him but thinking he was growing careless
about payment i asked for them once and several times and not only will
he not give them back but he denies that he owes them and says i never
lent him any such crowns or if i did that he repaid them and i have no
witnesses either of the loan or the payment for he never paid me i
want your worship to put him to his oath and if he swears he returned
them to me i forgive him the debt here and before god
what say you to this good old man you with the stick said sancho
to which the old man replied i admit senor that he lent them to me
but let your worship lower your staff and as he leaves it to my oath
ill swear that i gave them back and paid him really and truly
the governor lowered the staff and as he did so the old man who had the
stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he swore as
if he found it in his way and then laid his hand on the cross of the
staff saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him
had been lent him but that he had with his own hand given them back into
the hand of the other and that he not recollecting it was always
seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to
make to what his opponent said he said that no doubt his debtor had told
the truth for he believed him to be an honest man and a good christian
and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back the
crowns and that from that time forth he would make no further demand
the debtor took his stick again and bowing his head left the court
observing this and how without another word he made off and observing
too the resignation of the plaintiff sancho buried his head in his bosom
and remained for a short space in deep thought with the forefinger of
his right hand on his brow and nose then he raised his head and bade
them call back the old man with the stick for he had already taken his
departure they brought him back and as soon as sancho saw him he said
honest man give me that stick for i want it
willingly said the old man here it is senor and he put it into his
sancho took it and handing it to the other old man said to him go
and god be with you for now you are paid
i senor returned the old man why is this cane worth ten
yes said the governor or if not i am the greatest dolt in the world
now you will see whether i have got the headpiece to govern a whole
kingdom and he ordered the cane to be broken in two there in the
presence of all it was done and in the middle of it they found ten
gold crowns all were filled with amazement and looked upon their
governor as another solomon they asked him how he had come to the
conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane he replied that
observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while
he was taking the oath and swore that he had really and truly given him
the crowns and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the
stick again it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside
it and from this he said it might be seen that god sometimes guides
those who govern in their judgments even though they may be fools
besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention just such
another case and he had so good a memory that if it was not that he
forgot everything he wished to remember there would not be such a memory
in all the island to conclude the old men went off one crestfallen
and the other in high contentment all who were present were astonished
and he who was recording the words deeds and movements of sancho could
not make up his mind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as
a fool or as a man of sense
as soon as this case was disposed of there came into court a woman
holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well to do cattle
dealer and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming
justice senor governor justice and if i dont get it on earth ill go
look for it in heaven senor governor of my soul this wicked man caught
me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it was an
ill washed rag and woe is me got from me what i had kept these
three and twenty years and more defending it against moors and
christians natives and strangers and i always as hard as an oak and
keeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire or wool among the
brambles for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle
it remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not
said sancho and turning to the man he asked him what he had to say in
he all in confusion made answer sirs i am a poor pig dealer and this
morning i left the village to sell saving your presence four pigs and
between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than the worth
of them as i was returning to my village i fell in on the road with this
good dame and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out of everything
yoked us together i paid her fairly but she not contented laid hold of
me and never let go until she brought me here she says i forced her but
she lies by the oath i swear or am ready to swear and this is the whole
the governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him
he said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom the
governor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant he obeyed
trembling the woman took it and making a thousand salaams to all and
praying to god for the long life and health of the senor governor who had
such regard for distressed orphans and virgins she hurried out of court
with the purse grasped in both her hands first looking however to see
as soon as she was gone sancho said to the cattle dealer whose tears
were already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse
good fellow go after that woman and take the purse from her by force
even and come back with it here and he did not say it to one who was a
fool or deaf for the man was off like a flash of lightning and ran to
all the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case and
presently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before
she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it and he
struggling hard to take it from her but all to no purpose so stout was
the womans defence she all the while crying out justice from god and
the world see here senor governor the shamelessness and boldness of
this villain who in the middle of the town in the middle of the street
wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him give me
and did he take it asked the governor
take it said the woman id let my life be taken from me sooner than
the purse a pretty child id be its another sort of cat they must
throw in my face and not that poor scurvy knave pincers and hammers
mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip no nor lions
claws the soul from out of my body first
she is right said the man i own myself beaten and powerless i
confess i havent the strength to take it from her and he let go his
upon this the governor said to the woman let me see that purse my
worthy and sturdy friend she handed it to him at once and the governor
returned it to the man and said to the unforced mistress of force
sister if you had shown as much or only half as much spirit and
vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that purse
the strength of hercules could not have forced you be off and god speed
you and bad luck to you and dont show your face in all this island or
within six leagues of it on any side under pain of two hundred lashes
be off at once i say you shameless cheating shrew
the woman was cowed and went off disconsolately hanging her head and
the governor said to the man honest man go home with your money and
god speed you and for the future if you dont want to lose it see that
you dont take it into your head to yoke with anybody the man thanked
him as clumsily as he could and went his way and the bystanders were
again filled with admiration at their new governors judgments and
next two men one apparently a farm labourer and the other a tailor
for he had a pair of shears in his hand presented themselves before him
and the tailor said senor governor this labourer and i come before
your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday
for saving everybodys presence im a passed tailor god be thanked
and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me senor will
there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap measuring the cloth i
said there would he probably suspected as i supposed and i supposed
right that i wanted to steal some of the cloth led to think so by his
own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors and he told me to
see if there would be enough for two i guessed what he would be at and
i said yes he still following up his original unworthy notion went
on adding cap after cap and i yes after yes until we got as far as
five he has just this moment come for them i gave them to him but he
wont pay me for the making on the contrary he calls upon me to pay
yes replied the man but will your worship make him show the five
with all my heart said the tailor and drawing his hand from under his
cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it and said
there are the caps this good man asks for and by god and upon my
conscience i havent a scrap of cloth left and ill let the work be
all present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit
sancho set himself to think for a moment and then said it seems to me
that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long winded arguments
but only to give off hand the judgment of an honest man and so my
decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth
and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol and let there be no
if the previous decision about the cattle dealers purse excited the
admiration of the bystanders this provoked their laughter however the
governors orders were after all executed all this having been taken
down by his chronicler was at once despatched to the duke who was
looking out for it with great eagerness and here let us leave the good
sancho for his master sorely troubled in mind by altisidoras music
of the terrible bell and cat fright that don quixote got in the course of
we left don quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the
enamourned maid altisidora had given rise to he went to bed with them
and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moments rest
and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them but as time is
fleet and no obstacle can stay his course he came riding on the hours
and morning very soon arrived seeing which don quixote quitted the soft
down and nowise slothful dressed himself in his chamois suit and put
on his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings he threw
over him his scarlet mantle put on his head a montera of green velvet
trimmed with silver edging flung across his shoulder the baldric with
his good trenchant sword took up a large rosary that he always carried
with him and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the
antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting
for him but as he passed through a gallery altisidora and the other
damsel her friend were lying in wait for him and the instant
altisidora saw him she pretended to faint while her friend caught her in
her lap and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress
don quixote observed it and approaching them said i know very well
i know not from what replied the friend for altisidora is the
healthiest damsel in all this house and i have never heard her complain
all the time i have known her a plague on all the knights errant in the
world if they be all ungrateful go away senor don quixote for this
poor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here
to which don quixote returned do me the favour senora to let a lute
be placed in my chamber to night and i will comfort this poor maiden to
the best of my power for in the early stages of love a prompt
disillusion is an approved remedy and with this he retired so as not
to be remarked by any who might see him there
he had scarcely withdrawn when altisidora recovering from her swoon
said to her companion the lute must be left for no doubt don quixote
intends to give us some music and being his it will not be bad
they went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on and of the
lute don quixote asked for and she delighted beyond measure plotted
with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be
amusing but harmless and in high glee they waited for night which came
quickly as the day had come and as for the day the duke and duchess
spent it in charming conversation with don quixote
when eleven oclock came don quixote found a guitar in his chamber he
tried it opened the window and perceived that some persons were walking
in the garden and having passed his fingers over the frets of the guitar
and tuned it as well as he could he spat and cleared his chest and then
with a voice a little hoarse but full toned he sang the following
ballad which he had himself that day composed
t is by this that love works wonders
don quixote had got so far with his song to which the duke the duchess
altisidora and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his
window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to
it and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats
which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails such was the
din of the bells and the squalling of the cats that though the duke and
duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it while
don quixote stood paralysed with fear and as luck would have it two or
three of the cats made their way in through the grating of his chamber
and flying from one side to the other made it seem as if there was a
legion of devils at large in it they extinguished the candles that were
burning in the room and rushed about seeking some way of escape the
cord with the large bells never ceased rising and falling and most of
the people of the castle not knowing what was really the matter were at
their wits end with astonishment don quixote sprang to his feet and
drawing his sword began making passes at the grating shouting out
avaunt malignant enchanters avaunt ye witchcraft working rabble i am
don quixote of la mancha against whom your evil machinations avail not
nor have any power and turning upon the cats that were running about
the room he made several cuts at them they dashed at the grating and
escaped by it save one that finding itself hard pressed by the slashes
of don quixotes sword flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth
and nail with the pain of which he began to shout his loudest the duke
and duchess hearing this and guessing what it was ran with all haste to
his room and as the poor gentleman was striving with all his might to
detach the cat from his face they opened the door with a master key and
went in with lights and witnessed the unequal combat the duke ran
forward to part the combatants but don quixote cried out aloud let no
one take him from me leave me hand to hand with this demon this wizard
this enchanter i will teach him i myself who don quixote of la mancha
is the cat however never minding these threats snarled and held on
but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window don
quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not
in very good condition and greatly vexed that they did not let him
finish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an
enchanter they sent for some oil of johns wort and altisidora herself
with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts and as she did so
she said to him in a low voice all these mishaps have befallen thee
hardhearted knight for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy and
god grant thy squire sancho may forget to whip himself so that that
dearly beloved dulcinea of thine may never be released from her
enchantment that thou mayest never come to her bed at least while i who
to all this don quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs and
then stretched himself on his bed thanking the duke and duchess for
their kindness not because he stood in any fear of that bell ringing
rabble of enchanters in cat shape but because he recognised their good
intentions in coming to his rescue the duke and duchess left him to
repose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the
joke as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on
don quixote or cost him so dear for it cost him five days of confinement
to his bed during which he had another adventure pleasanter than the
late one which his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he
may turn his attention to sancho panza who was proceeding with great
wherein is continued the account of how sancho panza conducted himself in
the history says that from the justice court they carried sancho to a
sumptuous palace where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid out
with royal magnificence the clarions sounded as sancho entered the room
and four pages came forward to present him with water for his hands
which sancho received with great dignity the music ceased and sancho
seated himself at the head of the table for there was only that seat
placed and no more than one cover laid a personage who it appeared
afterwards was a physician placed himself standing by his side with a
whalebone wand in his hand they then lifted up a fine white cloth
covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different sorts one who
looked like a student said grace and a page put a laced bib on sancho
while another who played the part of head carver placed a dish of fruit
before him but hardly had he tasted a morsel when the man with the wand
touched the plate with it and they took it away from before him with the
utmost celerity the carver however brought him another dish and
sancho proceeded to try it but before he could get at it not to say
taste it already the wand had touched it and a page had carried it off
with the same promptitude as the fruit sancho seeing this was puzzled
and looking from one to another asked if this dinner was to be eaten
to this he with the wand replied it is not to be eaten senor governor
except as is usual and customary in other islands where there are
governors i senor am a physician and i am paid a salary in this
island to serve its governors as such and i have a much greater regard
for their health than for my own studying day and night and making
myself acquainted with the governors constitution in order to be able
to cure him when he falls sick the chief thing i have to do is to attend
at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be
fit for him and keep from him what i think will do him harm and be
injurious to his stomach and therefore i ordered that plate of fruit to
be removed as being too moist and that other dish i ordered to be
removed as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate
thirst for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture
well then said sancho that dish of roast partridges there that seems
so savoury will not do me any harm
to this the physician replied of those my lord the governor shall not
because replied the doctor our master hippocrates the polestar and
beacon of medicine says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala
perdicis autem pessima which means all repletion is bad but that of
in that case said sancho let senor doctor see among the dishes that
are on the table what will do me most good and least harm and let me eat
it without tapping it with his stick for by the life of the governor
and so may god suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger and in
spite of the doctor and all he may say to deny me food is the way to
your worship is right senor governor said the physician and
therefore your worship i consider should not eat of those stewed
rabbits there because it is a furry kind of food if that veal were not
roasted and served with pickles you might try it but it is out of the
that big dish that is smoking farther off said sancho seems to me to
be an olla podrida and out of the diversity of things in such ollas i
cant fail to light upon something tasty and good for me
absit said the doctor far from us be any such base thought there is
nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida to canons or
rectors of colleges or peasants weddings with your ollas podridas but
let us have none of them on the tables of governors where everything
that is present should be delicate and refined and the reason is that
always everywhere and by everybody simple medicines are more esteemed
than compound ones for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple
while in the compound we may by merely altering the quantity of the
things composing them but what i am of opinion the governor should cat
now in order to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of
wafer cakes and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces which will
sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the
doctor steadily and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and
he replied my name senor governor is doctor pedro recio de aguero i
am a native of a place called tirteafuera which lies between caracuel and
almodovar del campo on the right hand side and i have the degree of
to which sancho glowing all over with rage returned then let doctor
pedro recio de malaguero native of tirteafuera a place thats on the
right hand side as we go from caracuel to almodovar del campo graduate
of osuna get out of my presence at once or i swear by the sun ill take
a cudgel and by dint of blows beginning with him ill not leave a
doctor in the whole island at least of those i know to be ignorant for
as to learned wise sensible physicians them i will reverence and
honour as divine persons once more i say let pedro recio get out of this
or ill take this chair i am sitting on and break it over his head and
if they call me to account for it ill clear myself by saying i served
god in killing a bad doctor a general executioner and now give me
something to eat or else take your government for a trade that does not
feed its master is not worth two beans
the doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion and
he would have made a tirteafuera out of the room but that the same
instant a post horn sounded in the street and the carver putting his
head out of the window turned round and said its a courier from my
lord the duke no doubt with some despatch of importance
the courier came in all sweating and flurried and taking a paper from
his bosom placed it in the governors hands sancho handed it to the
majordomo and bade him read the superscription which ran thus to don
sancho panza governor of the island of barataria into his own hands or
those of his secretary sancho when he heard this said which of you is
my secretary i am senor said one of those present for i can read
and write and am a biscayan with that addition said sancho you
might be secretary to the emperor himself open this paper and see what
it says the new born secretary obeyed and having read the contents
said the matter was one to be discussed in private sancho ordered the
chamber to be cleared the majordomo and the carver only remaining so
the doctor and the others withdrew and then the secretary read the
it has come to my knowledge senor don sancho panza that certain enemies
of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some
night i know not when it behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch
that they surprise you not i also know by trustworthy spies that four
persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life
because they stand in dread of your great capacity keep your eyes open
and take heed who approaches you to address you and eat nothing that is
presented to you i will take care to send you aid if you find yourself
in difficulty but in all things you will act as may be expected of your
judgment from this place the sixteenth of august at four in the
sancho was astonished and those who stood by made believe to be so too
and turning to the majordomo he said to him what we have got to do
first and it must be done at once is to put doctor recio in the
lock up for if anyone wants to kill me it is he and by a slow death and
likewise said the carver it is my opinion your worship should not
eat anything that is on this table for the whole was a present from some
nuns and as they say behind the cross theres the devil
i dont deny it said sancho so for the present give me a piece of
bread and four pounds or so of grapes no poison can come in them for
the fact is i cant go on without eating and if we are to be prepared
for these battles that are threatening us we must be well provisioned
for it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes
and you secretary answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his
commands shall be obeyed to the letter as he directs and say from me to
my lady the duchess that i kiss her hands and that i beg of her not to
forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife teresa panza by a
messenger and i will take it as a great favour and will not fail to
serve her in all that may lie within my power and as you are about it
you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master don quixote that he may
see i am grateful bread and as a good secretary and a good biscayan you
may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best and now take
away this cloth and give me something to eat and ill be ready to meet
all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against me or my
at this instant a page entered saying here is a farmer on business who
wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance he
its very odd said sancho the ways of these men on business is it
possible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is
no hour for coming on business we who govern and we who are judges are
we not men of flesh and blood and are we not to be allowed the time
required for taking rest unless theyd have us made of marble by god
and on my conscience if the government remains in my hands which i have
a notion it wont ill bring more than one man on business to order
however tell this good man to come in but take care first of all that
he is not some spy or one of my assassins
no my lord said the page for he looks like a simple fellow and
either i know very little or he is as good as good bread
there is nothing to be afraid of said the majordomo for we are all
would it be possible carver said sancho now that doctor pedro recio
is not here to let me eat something solid and substantial if it were
even a piece of bread and an onion
to night at supper said the carver the shortcomings of the dinner
shall be made good and your lordship shall be fully contented
the farmer now came in a well favoured man that one might see a thousand
leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul the first thing he said
which should it be said the secretary but he who is seated in the
then i humble myself before him said the farmer and going on his
knees he asked for his hand to kiss it sancho refused it and bade him
stand up and say what he wanted the farmer obeyed and then said i am
a farmer senor a native of miguelturra a village two leagues from
another tirteafuera said sancho say on brother i know miguelturra
very well i can tell you for its not very far from my own town
the case is this senor continued the farmer that by gods mercy i
am married with the leave and licence of the holy roman catholic church
i have two sons students and the younger is studying to become
bachelor and the elder to be licentiate i am a widower for my wife
died or more properly speaking a bad doctor killed her on my hands
giving her a purge when she was with child and if it had pleased god
that the child had been born and was a boy i would have put him to
study for doctor that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and
so that if your wife had not died or had not been killed you would not
weve got that much settled said sancho get on brother for its
well then said the farmer this son of mine who is going to be a
bachelor fell in love in the said town with a damsel called clara
perlerina daughter of andres perlerino a very rich farmer and this
name of perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent but
because all the family are paralytics and for a better name they call
them perlerines though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an
oriental pearl and like a flower of the field if you look at her on the
right side on the left not so much for on that side she wants an eye
that she lost by small pox and though her face is thickly and deeply
pitted those who love her say they are not pits that are there but the
graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried she is so cleanly that
not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up as they say so that
one would fancy it was running away from her mouth and with all this she
looks extremely well for she has a wide mouth and but for wanting ten
or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with the
comeliest of her lips i say nothing for they are so fine and thin that
if lips might be reeled one might make a skein of them but being of a
different colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful for they are
mottled blue green and purple let my lord the governor pardon me for
painting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will be my
daughter for i love her and i dont find her amiss
paint what you will said sancho i enjoy your painting and if i had
dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your portrait
that i have still to furnish said the farmer but a time will come
when we may be able if we are not now and i can tell you senor if i
could paint her gracefulness and her tall figure it would astonish you
but that is impossible because she is bent double with her knees up to
her mouth but for all that it is easy to see that if she could stand up
shed knock her head against the ceiling and she would have given her
hand to my bachelor ere this only that she cant stretch it out for
its contracted but still one can see its elegance and fine make by its
that will do brother said sancho consider you have painted her from
head to foot what is it you want now come to the point without all this
beating about the bush and all these scraps and additions
i want your worship senor said the farmer to do me the favour of
giving me a letter of recommendation to the girls father begging him to
be so good as to let this marriage take place as we are not ill matched
either in the gifts of fortune or of nature for to tell the truth senor
governor my son is possessed of a devil and there is not a day but the
evil spirits torment him three or four times and from having once fallen
into the fire he has his face puckered up like a piece of parchment and
his eyes watery and always running but he has the disposition of an
angel and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling himself hed be a
is there anything else you want good man said sancho
theres another thing id like said the farmer but im afraid to
mention it however out it must for after all i cant let it be rotting
in my breast come what may i mean senor that id like your worship to
give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my bachelors
portion to help him in setting up house for they must in short live
by themselves without being subject to the interferences of their
just see if theres anything else youd like said sancho and dont
hold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty
no indeed there is not said the farmer
the moment he said this the governor started to his feet and seizing the
chair he had been sitting on exclaimed by all thats good you
ill bred boorish don bumpkin if you dont get out of this at once and
hide yourself from my sight ill lay your head open with this chair you
whoreson rascal you devils own painter and is it at this hour you come
to ask me for six hundred ducats how should i have them you stinking
brute and why should i give them to you if i had them you knave and
blockhead what have i to do with miguelturra or the whole family of the
perlerines get out i say or by the life of my lord the duke ill do as
i said youre not from miguelturra but some knave sent here from hell
to tempt me why you villain i have not yet had the government half a
day and you want me to have six hundred ducats already
the carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room which he did with
his head down and to all appearance in terror lest the governor should
carry his threats into effect for the rogue knew very well how to play
but let us leave sancho in his wrath and peace be with them all and let
us return to don quixote whom we left with his face bandaged and
doctored after the cat wounds of which he was not cured for eight days
and on one of these there befell him what cide hamete promises to relate
with that exactitude and truth with which he is wont to set forth
everything connected with this great history however minute it may be
of what befell don quixote with dona rodriguez the duchesss duenna
together with other occurrences worthy of record and eternal remembrance
exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded don quixote with
his face bandaged and marked not by the hand of god but by the claws of
six days he remained without appearing in public and one night as he lay
awake thinking of his misfortunes and of altisidoras pursuit of him he
perceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key and
he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make
an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the
fidelity he owed to his lady dulcinea del toboso no said he firmly
persuaded of the truth of his idea and he said it loud enough to be
heard the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me
renounce my adoration of her whom i bear stamped and graved in the core
of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels be thou lady mine
transformed into a clumsy country wench or into a nymph of golden tagus
weaving a web of silk and gold let merlin or montesinos hold thee
captive where they will whereer thou art thou art mine and whereer i
am must be thine the very instant he had uttered these words the door
opened he stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow
satin coverlet with a cap on his head and his face and his moustaches
tied up his face because of the scratches and his moustaches to keep
them from drooping and falling down in which trim he looked the most
extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived he kept his eyes fixed
on the door and just as he was expecting to see the love smitten and
unhappy altisidora make her appearance he saw coming in a most venerable
duenna in a long white bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from
head to foot between the fingers of her left hand she held a short
lighted candle while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from
her eyes which were covered by spectacles of great size and she
don quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower and observing her
costume and noting her silence he concluded that it must be some witch
or sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief
and he began crossing himself at a great rate the spectre still
advanced and on reaching the middle of the room looked up and saw the
energy with which don quixote was crossing himself and if he was scared
by seeing such a figure as hers she was terrified at the sight of his
for the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the
bandages that disfigured him she gave a loud scream and exclaiming
jesus whats this i see let fall the candle in her fright and then
finding herself in the dark turned about to make off but stumbling on
her skirts in her consternation she measured her length with a mighty
don quixote in his trepidation began saying i conjure thee phantom or
whatever thou art tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with me
if thou art a soul in torment say so and all that my powers can do i
will do for thee for i am a catholic christian and love to do good to
all the world and to this end i have embraced the order of
knight errantry to which i belong the province of which extends to doing
the unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured by her own fear
guessed don quixotes and in a low plaintive voice answered senor don
quixote if so be you are indeed don quixote i am no phantom or spectre
or soul in purgatory as you seem to think but dona rodriguez duenna of
honour to my lady the duchess and i come to you with one of those
tell me senora dona rodriguez said don quixote do you perchance
come to transact any go between business because i must tell you i am
not available for anybodys purpose thanks to the peerless beauty of my
lady dulcinea del toboso in short senora dona rodriguez if you will
leave out and put aside all love messages you may go and light your
candle and come back and we will discuss all the commands you have for
me and whatever you wish saving only as i said all seductive
i carry nobodys messages senor said the duenna little you know me
nay im not far enough advanced in years to take to any such childish
tricks god be praised i have a soul in my body still and all my teeth
and grinders in my mouth except one or two that the colds so common in
this aragon country have robbed me of but wait a little while i go and
light my candle and i will return immediately and lay my sorrows before
you as before one who relieves those of all the world and without
staying for an answer she quitted the room and left don quixote
tranquilly meditating while he waited for her a thousand thoughts at
once suggested themselves to him on the subject of this new adventure
and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in him to expose
himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to his lady and
said he to himself who knows but that the devil being wily and
cunning may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna having failed with
empresses queens duchesses marchionesses and countesses many a time
have i heard it said by many a man of sense that he will sooner offer you
a flat nosed wench than a roman nosed one and who knows but this
privacy this opportunity this silence may awaken my sleeping desires
and lead me in these my latter years to fall where i have never tripped
in cases of this sort it is better to flee than to await the battle but
i must be out of my senses to think and utter such nonsense for it is
impossible that a long white hooded spectacled duenna could stir up or
excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in the world is
there a duenna on earth that has fair flesh is there a duenna in the
world that escapes being ill tempered wrinkled and prudish avaunt
then ye duenna crew undelightful to all mankind oh but that lady did
well who they say had at the end of her reception room a couple of
figures of duennas with spectacles and lace cushions as if at work and
those statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety to the
room as if they had been real duennas
so saying he leaped off the bed intending to close the door and not
allow senora rodriguez to enter but as he went to shut it senora
rodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted and having a closer view of
don quixote with the coverlet round him and his bandages and night cap
she was alarmed afresh and retreating a couple of paces exclaimed am
i safe sir knight for i dont look upon it as a sign of very great
virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed
i may well ask the same senora said don quixote and i do ask
whether i shall be safe from being assailed and forced
of whom and against whom do you demand that security sir knight said
of you and against you i ask it said don quixote for i am not
marble nor are you brass nor is it now ten oclock in the morning but
midnight or a trifle past it i fancy and we are in a room more secluded
and retired than the cave could have been where the treacherous and
daring aeneas enjoyed the fair soft hearted dido but give me your hand
senora i require no better protection than my own continence and my own
sense of propriety as well as that which is inspired by that venerable
head dress and so saying he kissed her right hand and took it in his
own she yielding it to him with equal ceremoniousness and here cide
hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he says that to have seen the pair
marching from the door to the bed linked hand in hand in this way he
would have given the best of the two tunics he had
don quixote finally got into bed and dona rodriguez took her seat on a
chair at some little distance from his couch without taking off her
spectacles or putting aside the candle don quixote wrapped the
bedclothes round him and covered himself up completely leaving nothing
but his face visible and as soon as they had both regained their
composure he broke silence saying now senora dona rodriguez you may
unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart
and afflicted bowels and by me you shall be listened to with chaste
i believe it replied the duenna from your worships gentle and
winning presence only such a christian answer could be expected the fact
is then senor don quixote that though you see me seated in this chair
here in the middle of the kingdom of aragon and in the attire of a
despised outcast duenna i am from the asturias of oviedo and of a
family with which many of the best of the province are connected by
blood but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents who i
know not how were unseasonably reduced to poverty brought me to the
court of madrid where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes
my parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality
and i would have you know that for hemming and sewing i have never been
surpassed by any all my life my parents left me in service and returned
to their own country and a few years later went no doubt to heaven
for they were excellent good catholic christians i was left an orphan
with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given
to servants of my sort in palaces but about this time without any
encouragement on my part one of the esquires of the household fell in
love with me a man somewhat advanced in years full bearded and
personable and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself for he
came of a mountain stock we did not carry on our loves with such secrecy
but that they came to the knowledge of my lady and she not to have any
fuss about it had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother
roman catholic church of which marriage a daughter was born to put an
end to my good fortune if i had any not that i died in childbirth for
i passed through it safely and in due season but because shortly
afterwards my husband died of a certain shock he received and had i time
to tell you of it i know your worship would be surprised and here she
began to weep bitterly and said pardon me senor don quixote if i am
unable to control myself for every time i think of my unfortunate
husband my eyes fill up with tears god bless me with what an air of
dignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as
jet for in those days they did not use coaches or chairs as they say
they do now and ladies rode behind their squires this much at least i
cannot help telling you that you may observe the good breeding and
punctiliousness of my worthy husband as he was turning into the calle de
santiago in madrid which is rather narrow one of the alcaldes of the
court with two alguacils before him was coming out of it and as soon
as my good squire saw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he
would turn and accompany him my lady who was riding behind him said to
him in a low voice what are you about you sneak dont you see that i
am here the alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to
him proceed senor for it is i rather who ought to accompany my lady
dona casilda for that was my mistresss name still my husband cap in
hand persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde and seeing this my
lady filled with rage and vexation pulled out a big pin or i rather
think a bodkin out of her needle case and drove it into his back with
such force that my husband gave a loud yell and writhing fell to the
ground with his lady her two lacqueys ran to rise her up and the
alcalde and the alguacils did the same the guadalajara gate was all in
commotion i mean the idlers congregated there my mistress came back on
foot and my husband hurried away to a barbers shop protesting that he
was run right through the guts the courtesy of my husband was noised
abroad to such an extent that the boys gave him no peace in the street
and on this account and because he was somewhat shortsighted my lady
dismissed him and it was chagrin at this i am convinced beyond a doubt
that brought on his death i was left a helpless widow with a daughter
on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea foam at length however
as i had the character of being an excellent needlewoman my lady the
duchess then lately married to my lord the duke offered to take me with
her to this kingdom of aragon and my daughter also and here as time
went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in the world she
sings like a lark dances quick as thought foots it like a gipsy reads
and writes like a schoolmaster and does sums like a miser of her
neatness i say nothing for the running water is not purer and her age
is now if my memory serves me sixteen years five months and three days
one more or less to come to the point the son of a very rich farmer
living in a village of my lord the dukes not very far from here fell in
love with this girl of mine and in short how i know not they came
together and under the promise of marrying her he made a fool of my
daughter and will not keep his word and though my lord the duke is
aware of it for i have complained to him not once but many and many a
time and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my daughter he
turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me the reason being that as
the deceivers father is so rich and lends him money and is constantly
going security for his debts he does not like to offend or annoy him in
any way now senor i want your worship to take it upon yourself to
redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms for by what all the
world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and
help the unfortunate let your worship put before you the unprotected
condition of my daughter her youth and all the perfections i have said
she possesses and before god and on my conscience out of all the
damsels my lady has there is not one that comes up to the sole of her
shoe and the one they call altisidora and look upon as the boldest and
gayest of them put in comparison with my daughter does not come within
two leagues of her for i would have you know senor all is not gold
that glitters and that same little altisidora has more forwardness than
good looks and more impudence than modesty besides being not very
sound for she has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be
near her for a moment and even my lady the duchess but ill hold my
tongue for they say that walls have ears
for heavens sake dona rodriguez what ails my lady the duchess asked
adjured in that way replied the duenna i cannot help answering the
question and telling the whole truth senor don quixote have you
observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess that smooth complexion of
hers like a burnished polished sword those two cheeks of milk and
carmine that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to
spurn the earth so that one would fancy she went radiating health
wherever she passed well then let me tell you she may thank first of
all god for this and next two issues that she has one in each leg by
which all the evil humours of which the doctors say she is full are
blessed virgin exclaimed don quixote and is it possible that my lady
the duchess has drains of that sort i would not have believed it if the
barefoot friars had told it me but as the lady dona rodriguez says so
it must be so but surely such issues and in such places do not
discharge humours but liquid amber verily i do believe now that this
practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the health
don quixote had hardly said this when the chamber door flew open with a
loud bang and with the start the noise gave her dona rodriguez let the
candle fall from her hand and the room was left as dark as a wolfs
mouth as the saying is suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize
her by the throat so tightly that she could not croak while some one
else without uttering a word very briskly hoisted up her petticoats
and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that
anyone would have felt pity for her but although don quixote felt it he
never stirred from his bed but lay quiet and silent nay apprehensive
that his turn for a drubbing might be coming nor was the apprehension an
idle one one for leaving the duenna who did not dare to cry out well
basted the silent executioners fell upon don quixote and stripping him
of the sheet and the coverlet they pinched him so fast and so hard that
he was driven to defend himself with his fists and all this in
marvellous silence the battle lasted nearly half an hour and then the
phantoms fled dona rodriguez gathered up her skirts and bemoaning her
fate went out without saying a word to don quixote and he sorely
pinched puzzled and dejected remained alone and there we will leave
him wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced
him to such a state but that shall be told in due season for sancho
claims our attention and the methodical arrangement of the story demands
of what happened sancho in making the round of his island
we left the great governor angered and irritated by that
portrait painting rogue of a farmer who instructed the majordomo as the
majordomo was by the duke tried to practise upon him he however fool
boor and clown as he was held his own against them all saying to those
round him and to doctor pedro recio who as soon as the private business
of the dukes letter was disposed of had returned to the room now i see
plainly enough that judges and governors ought to be and must be made of
brass not to feel the importunities of the applicants that at all times
and all seasons insist on being heard and having their business
despatched and their own affairs and no others attended to come what
may and if the poor judge does not hear them and settle the
matter either because he cannot or because that is not the time set
apart for hearing them forthwith they abuse him and run him down and
gnaw at his bones and even pick holes in his pedigree you silly stupid
applicant dont be in a hurry wait for the proper time and season for
doing business dont come at dinner hour or at bed time for judges are
only flesh and blood and must give to nature what she naturally demands
of them all except myself for in my case i give her nothing to eat
thanks to senor doctor pedro recio tirteafuera here who would have me
die of hunger and declares that death to be life and the same sort of
