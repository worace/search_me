certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossible
the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that
pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with its gray mane
which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for a
single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious
movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had
lifted the dying man and were moving him
catch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servants
say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here
exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and
the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they
as the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young man he
caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
mans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly
leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones
its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not
disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre
remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to
petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had
carried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched pierres hand
and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man
had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just
completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his hands
were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward
when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a
look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man
either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they
must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing
what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikhaylovna made
a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving
her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck
so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his
lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single
muscle of the counts face stirred once more pierre looked
questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next anna
mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed
pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right anna
mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naively
symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his
stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look
as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at the
spot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna mikhaylovna
indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance
of these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted
about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad
muscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch the twitching
increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre
realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth
issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikhaylovna looked attentively
at the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed
first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasili in an
inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the
sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who
stood constantly at the head of the bed
wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to
turn the counts heavy body toward the wall
while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he
noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm
or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any
rate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierres terror stricken face
and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared
quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own
helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering
in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes the
sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall he sighed
he is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of the
princesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us go
there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and the
eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the
great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companion
they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide
i cant bear the sight of that woman
catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said prince
vasili to anna mikhaylovna go and take something my poor anna
to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the small
there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this
delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrained
animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup
before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small
circular room around the table all who were at count bezukhovs house
that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered
this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables
during balls given at the house pierre who did not know how to dance
had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed
through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare
shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which
repeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimly
lighted by two candles on one small table tea things and supper dishes
stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of
people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and
betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what
was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did
not eat anything though he would very much have liked to he looked
inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
to the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest
princess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a
short interval followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the
princess and they were both speaking in excited whispers
permit me princess to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same
state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room
but my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but
impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
from passing wont this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he
needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already
prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with
one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so flabby
that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore
the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying
come my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases you know
i dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two
ladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she
held in her hand all i know is that his real will is in his writing
table and this is a paper he has forgotten
she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar
i know my dear kind princess said anna mikhaylovna seizing the
portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily dear
princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous en
the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the
portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the
princess did speak her words would not be flattering to anna
mikhaylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none
pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in a
why dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud
that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why do you
remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making
a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room intriguer she
hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio
but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
prince vasili rose oh said he with reproach and surprise this is
let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will go
and ask him i does that satisfy you
but prince said anna mikhaylovna after such a solemn sacrament
allow him a moments peace here pierre tell them your opinion said
she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing
with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all
dignity and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasili
remember that you will answer for the consequences said prince vasili
severely you dont know what you are doing
vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna
prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands
at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long and
which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged
against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out
what are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you leave
her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldest
princess and prince vasili recovering themselves followed her a few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again
biting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed an
yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been
waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in her
prince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was
sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierre
noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
ah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was in
his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it
before how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am
near sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is
anna mikhaylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet
pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his
forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said
come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as
she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could
see his face anna mikhaylovna left him and when she returned he was
fast asleep with his head on his arm
in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre
yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you but
god will support you you are young and are now i hope in command of
an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i know you well
enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes
duties on you and you must be a man
perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not been
there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised
me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris but he had no
time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your fathers wish
pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
silence at princess anna mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre anna
mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking in the
morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of
count bezukhovs death she said the count had died as she would herself
wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as to the
last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could
not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better
during those awful moments the father who so remembered everything and
everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or
pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief
though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father
it is painful but it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such
men as the old count and his worthy son said she of the behavior of
the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly but in
at bald hills prince nicholas andreevich bolkonskis estate the
arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected but this
expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
princes household general in chief prince nicholas andreevich
nicknamed in society the king of prussia ever since the emperor
paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
with his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle
bourienne though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals he still continued to live in the country remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to
bald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to say
that there are only two sources of human vice idleness and
superstition and only two virtues activity and intelligence he
himself undertook his daughters education and to develop these two
cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till
she was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time was
occupied he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs solving
problems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working
in the garden or superintending the building that was always going on
at his estate as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity
regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
exactitude he always came to table under precisely the same conditions
and not only at the same hour but at the same minute with those about
him from his daughter to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably
exacting so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused although he was
in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every high
official appointed to the province in which the princes estate lay
considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber
just as the architect gardener or princess mary did till the prince
appeared punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in this
antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
small old man with powdered wig small withered hands and bushy gray
eyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd
on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive princess
mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
silent prayer every morning she came in like that and every morning
prayed that the daily interview might pass off well
an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
quietly and said in a whisper please walk in
through the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess timidly
opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at the
entrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use the
large table covered with books and plans the tall glass fronted
bookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing while
standing up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around all indicated
continuous varied and orderly activity the motion of the small foot
shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure of
the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed the
tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more turns
of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel
dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching
the table summoned his daughter he never gave his children a blessing
so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regarding
quite well all right then sit down he took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
for tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a scratch
from one paragraph to another with his hard nail
the princess bent over the exercise book on the table
wait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenly taking
a letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above the table
at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess face she took it quickly and bent her head over it
from heloise asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still
yes its from julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a
ill let two more letters pass but the third ill read said the
prince sternly im afraid you write much nonsense ill read the
read this if you like father said the princess blushing still more
the third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the
letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the
well madam he began stooping over the book close to his daughter
and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat so that
she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age
and tobacco which she had known so long now madam these triangles
are equal please note that the angle abc
the princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glittering
close to her the red patches on her face came and went and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear
would prevent her understanding any of her fathers further
explanations however clear they might be whether it was the teachers
fault or the pupils this same thing happened every day the princess
eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear anything but was
only conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her of his
breath and the smell of him and could think only of how to get away
quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace the old man
was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily
backward and forward made efforts to control himself and not become
vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimes
well now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book aside
and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and down
lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down again
he drew up his chair and continued to explain
this wont do princess it wont do said he when princess mary
having taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lesson
was about to leave mathematics are most important madam i dont want
to have you like our silly ladies get used to it and youll like it
and he patted her cheek it will drive all the nonsense out of your
she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise has sent
you religious i dont interfere with anyones belief i have looked
at it take it well now go go
he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her
princess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer she
sat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and
which was littered with books and papers the princess was as untidy as
her father was tidy she put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
the seal of her letter it was from her most intimate friend from
childhood that same julie karagina who had been at the rostovs name
dear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing is
separation though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us
our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against
fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot
overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we
parted why are we not together as we were last summer in your big
study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i now as
three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle
calm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see before me
having read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
which stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure and
thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness
at her reflection in the glass she flatters me thought the princess
turning away and continuing to read but julie did not flatter her
friend the princess eyes large deep and luminous it seemed as if at
times there radiated from them shafts of warm light were so beautiful
that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an
attraction more powerful than that of beauty but the princess never saw
the beautiful expression of her own eyes the look they had when she was
not thinking of herself as with everyone her face assumed a forced
unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass she went on
all moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is already
abroad the other is with the guards who are starting on their march to
the frontier our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought
intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war god grant
that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may be
overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in his
goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers this
war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i mean
young nicholas rostov who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
inactive and has left the university to join the army i will confess to
you dear mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the
army was a great grief to me this young man of whom i spoke to you
last summer is so noble minded and full of that real youthfulness which
one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly
he is so frank and has so much heart he is so pure and poetic that my
relations with him transient as they were have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so much
someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then
that is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to know
these poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are
generally the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship
this poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough of
this the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death of
old count bezukhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesses
have received very little prince vasili nothing and it is monsieur
pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezukhov and possessor
of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that prince vasili played
a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg
i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and
inheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all used
to know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bezukhov and the
owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused to
watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward him
though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of
fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by
finding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know the
matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess
bezukhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post a
propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie
anna mikhaylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan of
marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince vasilis
son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich
and distinguee and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen
i dont know what you will think of it but i consider it my duty to let
you know of it he is said to be very handsome and a terrible
scapegrace that is all i have been able to find out about him
but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper and
mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins read the
mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here though
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give my
respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle
bourienne i embrace you as i love you
ps let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife
the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenly
rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet of
paper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrote
dear and precious friend your letter of the 13th has given me great
delight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of which
you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect
on you you complain of our separation what then should i say if i
dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah if we
had not religion to console us life would be very sad why do you
suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young
man on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand such
feelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve of
them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christian
love love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeter
and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can
inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself
the news of count bezukhovs death reached us before your letter and my
father was much affected by it he says the count was the last
representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn
now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune
i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i value
most in people as to his inheritance and the part played by prince
vasili it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divine
saviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god are terribly
true i pity prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierre so young
and burdened with such riches to what temptations he will be exposed
if i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be poorer
than the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the volume
you have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since you
tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak
human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend
time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit
i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing
their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their
doubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggeration
quite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read the epistles
and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain
for how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and
holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an
impenetrable veil between us and the eternal let us rather confine
ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has
left for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them and
follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble
human minds roam the better we shall please god who rejects all
knowledge that does not come from him and the less we seek to fathom
what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will he
vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit
my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he
has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili in
regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweet
friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
conform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay the
duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as
faithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
toward him whom he may give me for husband
i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival at
bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief one
however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
into which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where you
are at the heart of affairs and of the world is the talk all of war
even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature which townsfolk
consider characteristic of the country rumors of war are heard and
painfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches and
countermarches things of which i understand nothing and the day before
yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a
heartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
people and starting to join the army you should have seen the state of
the mothers wives and children of the men who were going and should
have heard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws
of its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness of injuries
and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one
adieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holy
mother keep you in their holy and all powerful care
ah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatched
mine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle
bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs
she brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a
quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and self satisfied
princess i must warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently
listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated
grasseyement the prince has been scolding michael ivanovich he is in
a very bad humor very morose be prepared
ah dear friend replied princess mary i have asked you never to
warn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judge him
the princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes
late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting
room with a look of alarm between twelve and two oclock as the day
was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the
the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
the prince who was in his large study from the far side of the house
through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages twenty
just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch prince andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to
alight and let her pass into the house before him old tikhon wearing
a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in a
whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door
tikhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual event
must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince andrew
apparently knew this as well as tikhon he looked at his watch as if to
ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at home
last and having assured himself that they had not he turned to his
he will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to marys room he
the little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes and
her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
why this is a palace she said to her husband looking around with
the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball lets
come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled at tikhon at
her husband and at the footman who accompanied them
is that mary practicing lets go quietly and take her by surprise
prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression
youve grown older tikhon he said in passing to the old man who
before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
came the pretty fair haired frenchwoman mademoiselle bourienne
ah what joy for the princess exclaimed she at last i must let her
no no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne said the little
princess kissing her i know you already through my sister in laws
friendship for you she was not expecting us
they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
of the oft repeated passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped and
made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant
the little princess entered the room the passage broke off in the
middle a cry was heard then princess marys heavy tread and the sound
of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who had only
met once before for a short time at his wedding were in each others
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers of
music do when they hear a false note the two women let go of one
another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each others
hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each
other on the face and then to prince andrews surprise both began to
cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry prince
andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quite
natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their
heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting
ah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and then laughed
i dreamed last night you were not expecting us ah mary
you have got thinner and you have grown stouter
i knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle bourienne
and i had no idea exclaimed princess mary ah andrew i did not
prince andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he
told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess mary had
turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm
gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment
the little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and
drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
glittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they had
had on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in her
condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left
all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
to dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty
odyntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for mary
a real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary was
still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
of love and sadness it was plain that she was following a train of
thought independent of her sister in laws words in the midst of a
description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother
so you are really going to the war andrew she said sighing
he is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had
princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of
thought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure
the face of the little princess changed she sighed and said yes
her lip descended she brought her face close to her sister in laws and
she needs rest said prince andrew with a frown dont you lise
take her to your room and ill go to father how is he just the same
yes just the same though i dont know what your opinion will be
and are the hours the same and the walks in the avenues and the
lathe asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was
the hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my
geometry lessons said princess mary gleefully as if her lessons in
geometry were among the greatest delights of her life
when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
prince to get up tikhon came to call the young prince to his father
the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
sons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he
dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in old fashioned
style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrew
entered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look and
manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which
he talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leather covered
chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tikhon
ah heres the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the old
man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tikhon was
you at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like this
hell soon have us too for his subjects how are you and he held out
the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner he used
to say that a nap after dinner was silver before dinner golden he
cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy
eyebrows prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot
indicated to him he made no reply on his fathers favorite topic
making fun of the military men of the day and more particularly of
yes father i have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant
said prince andrew following every movement of his fathers face with
an eager and respectful look how is your health
only fools and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i am busy from
morning till night and abstemious so of course i am well
god has nothing to do with it well go on he continued returning to
his hobby tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte
give me time to collect my wits father said he with a smile that
showed that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from loving and
honoring him why i have not yet had time to settle down
nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see
whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand the house
for your wife is ready princess mary will take her there and show her
over and theyll talk nineteen to the dozen thats their womans way
i am glad to have her sit down and talk about mikhelsons army i
understand tolstoys too a simultaneous expedition but whats
the southern army to do prussia is neutral i know that what about
austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room
followed by tikhon who ran after him handing him different articles of
clothing what of sweden how will they cross pomerania
prince andrew seeing that his father insisted began at first
reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit
changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went on to explain
the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained how an army
ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out
of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was
to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two hundred and twenty
thousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate in
italy and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many english
were to land at naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand
men was to attack the french from different sides the old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three
times unexpectedly interrupted once he stopped it by shouting the
this meant that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted
and will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully
the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his
description the old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age
malbrook sen va t en guerre dieu sait quand reviendra 
 marlborough is going to the wars god knows when hell return
i dont say its a plan i approve of said the son i am only telling
you what it is napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than
well youve told me nothing new and the old man repeated
dieu sait quand reviendra go to the dining room
at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the
dining room where his daughter in law princess mary and mademoiselle
bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by
a strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though the
position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
not have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept
very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michael
ivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had
more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was not
a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually spoke to the
taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone else
in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmen one
behind each chair stood waiting for the prince to enter the head
butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making
signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
by which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large
gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes
bolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate
of a ruling prince in a crown an alleged descendant of rurik and
ancestor of the bolkonskis prince andrew looking again at that
genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing
how thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had
princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand
what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with
everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy with
princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers
criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard
coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under
their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the
sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
im glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her
eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sit
he indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law a footman moved
ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure
he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only
you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said
the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was
silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and
she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and
she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
from various people and retelling the town gossip
countess apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried
her eyes out she said growing more and more lively
as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly
and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivanovich
well michael ivanovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it
prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me
what forces are being collected against him while you and i never
michael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i had said such
things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on
which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the
he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the
and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the
generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not
only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a
b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant
little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any
potemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that
there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only
a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing
pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his
fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him
the past always seems good said he but did not suvorov himself fall
into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to
who told you that who cried the prince suvorov and he jerked
away his plate which tikhon briskly caught suvorov consider
prince andrew two frederick and suvorov moreau moreau would
have been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand but he had the
hofs kriegs wurst schnapps rath on his hands it would have puzzled the
devil himself when you get there youll find out what those hofs
