who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant
just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the
next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostov
good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov and
evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities
get him to his place and give him some water said rostov pointing to
yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his
eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not
no its impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering his
eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on
him on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoat
sat an old unshaven gray bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton with a
stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the mans neighbor
on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticed
that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the
old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated
above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some
distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a
snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were
rolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran
why this one seems he began turning to the assistant
and how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw
quivering hes been dead since morning after all were men not
ill send someone at once he shall be taken away taken away at once
said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor
yes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his eyes and
shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful
envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room
going along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officers
wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open there
were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
gowns the first person rostov met in the officers ward was a thin
little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a
nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth
rostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before
see where weve met again said the little man tushin tushin dont
you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and ive had a bit
cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty
sleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov my
neighbor he added when he heard who rostov wanted here here and
tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several
how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov still
aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the
soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious
looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that
denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it
ah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the same
voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under this
habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed
itself in the expression of denisovs face and the intonations of his
his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks
after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostov
what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him and
smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about
the general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters did
rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the
regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on
outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was
only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on
rostovs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from
under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began
reading his paper and specially drew rostovs attention to the stinging
rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had
gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside gradually
began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostov
noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that
story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the next
bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and
smoking a pipe and little one armed tushin still listened shaking his
head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted
but what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best
simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will
now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted
me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which he
tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an
expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i would
ask mercy but im being court martialed for bwinging wobbers to book
let them twy me im not afwaid of anyone ive served the tsar and my
countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded
listen im witing to them stwaight this is what i say if i had
its certainly well written said tushin but thats not the point
vasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov one has to submit and
vasili dmitrich doesnt want to you know the auditor told you it was a
the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you
ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he
indicating rostov has connections on the staff you wont find a
havent i said im not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went
rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively
felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the
safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov
he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper
when the reading of denisovs virulent reply which took more than an
hour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in
a most dejected state of mind amid denisovs hospital comrades who had
gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to their
stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening
late in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisov
yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and
taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he
had an inkpot and sat down to write
it seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he said
coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the
petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov
without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply
he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile
having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
denisovs affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor
on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in
tilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he
was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon
whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte
you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling
boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the
general patted him on the shoulder with a smile
you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him
boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two
emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon
pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the
pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleons arrival saw both emperors
get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped
quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how
they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the
highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all
that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting
at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and
about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken
by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the
pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again
when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and fifty
three minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts
he felt to be of historic importance as the emperors suite was a very
small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his
success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this
interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this boris
felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only
become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him
twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the
latter knew his face and all those at court far from cold shouldering
him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been
boris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski
zhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fond
of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french
officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and
on the evening of the twenty fourth of june count zhilinski arranged a
supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aide de camp of
napoleons there were also several french officers of the guard and a
page of napoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic french family
that same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging
rostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far from
having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the french
who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had taken place
at headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte and the french were
still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear only
recently talking with one of platovs cossack officers rostov had
argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a
sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to meet a wounded
french colonel on the road rostov had maintained with heat that peace
was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal
bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of
french officers in boris lodging dressed in uniforms he had been
accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts
of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust his
head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he always
experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at
the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there
boris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him an
expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first
ah its you very glad very glad to see you he said however
coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first
ive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have
no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dans
un moment je suis a vous  he said answering someone who called him
 in a minute i shall be at your disposal
the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face having
evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both
rostovs hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking
serenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as if
screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostov
oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said boris and he
led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him
to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar
count zhilinski le comte n n le capitaine s s said he naming
his guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed
zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did not
appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same
pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he
had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen
with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the
obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter had probably come to
no i came on business replied rostov briefly
rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
dissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in a bad
humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and
that he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for he alone
took no part in the conversation which again became general the looks
the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting here
for he rose and went up to boris
anyhow im in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over my
oh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come and lie
down in my room and have a rest
they went into the little room where boris slept rostov without
sitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame in
some way telling him about denisovs affair asking him whether
through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on
denisovs behalf and get denisovs petition handed in when he and boris
were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look boris
in the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with one leg crossed
over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of
his right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a
subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into rostovs
eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostov felt
i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in
such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the
emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general
so you dont want to do anything well then say so rostov almost
on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought
at that moment zhilinskis voice was heard calling boris
well then go go go said rostov and refusing supper and
remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long
time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room
rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
denisovs behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance
as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so
and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the
following day on that day june 27 the preliminaries of peace were
signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross
of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first
degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a
battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the
emperors were to be present at that banquet
rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the
latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next
morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round
hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french
emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors
draped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and n in
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed
boris doesnt want to help me and i dont want to ask him thats
settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i wont leave
here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without
getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought
rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander
saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out
i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand
the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me
for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side
justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be
more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for
being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who
was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go
in its all nonsense ill go in and hand the letter to the emperor
myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and
suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for
the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house
no i wont miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he
thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of
the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his
feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even
thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the
greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing
people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the
a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he
saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the
to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a
a petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown the door
on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was
doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so
fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away
but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov
a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and
a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that
room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new
pair of handsome silk embroidered braces that for some reason
attracted rostovs attention this man was speaking to someone in the
a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing
what is it asked the person in the other room
another petitioner answered the man with the braces
tell him to come later hell be coming out directly we must go
rostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped
whom have you come from who are you
what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with
you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him
rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass
cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding
himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to
shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety
of his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was
making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
familiar voice called him and a hand detained him
what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice
it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special favor
during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in
rostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly
jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice
told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the
general knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his head
im sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter
hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining
denisovs case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on
the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the
gentlemen of the emperors suite ran down the stairs and went to their
horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the
emperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once
was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized
rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive
civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored
that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and
mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
rose again in rostovs soul in all its old force in the uniform of the
preobrazhensk regiment white chamois leather breeches and high boots
and wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legion
dhonneur the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves
and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him
brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to
some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of rostovs
all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time
the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse
again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom
was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with
his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and
said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all
i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i
and he raised his foot to the stirrup
the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and
rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov
the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of
the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
french guards in their bearskin caps on the left
as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented
arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and
at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else
he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a
white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a
very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson gold embroidered
saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did
so rostov with his cavalrymans eye could not help noticing that
napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions
shouted hurrah and vive lempereur napoleon said something to
alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each others hands
napoleons face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was
in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were
pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of
alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander
treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter
alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached
the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to
the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he
sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the
bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating
this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into
alexanders eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him
to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added
napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up
before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and
took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the
bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand
tore it in doing so and threw it away an aide de camp behind him
to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in
the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back
kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in his
lazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the first
where are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who did
not know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his
colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called
napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out
behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing
at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed
something from one to another and a page the same one rostov had seen
the previous evening at boris ran forward and bowing respectfully
over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in
it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two
fingers together and the badge was between them then he approached
lazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch
looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now
doing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white hand
holding the order touched one of lazarevs buttons it was as if
napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
that soldiers breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and
distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the
cross on lazarevs breast and dropping his hand turned toward
alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and it
officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and
fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little man
with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing
motionless presenting arms looked again straight into alexanders eyes
as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something
else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid
the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion
breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables
lazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced
him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and
civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french
voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two
officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by
what dyou think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was
tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner
yes but what luck for lazarev twelve hundred francs pension for
heres a cap lads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy
have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another
the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure
yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it
and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st georges
cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must
boris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk
banquet on his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a
rostov how dyou do we missed one another he said and could not
refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and
rostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a
distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not
bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he
remembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and the
whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so
vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked
round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that self
satisfied bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor
liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs
and those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and
denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such
the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to
eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning
there he found so many people among them officers who like himself
had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation
naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of
the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would
have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition
nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on
tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to
his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the
officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov
began shouting with uncalled for wrath and therefore much to the
how can you judge whats best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to
his face how can you judge the emperors actions what right have we
to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors aims or his
but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer
justifying himself and unable to understand rostovs outburst except
we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he
went on if we are ordered to die we must die if were punished it
means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the emperor
pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance
with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin
judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left that
way we shall be saying there is no god nothing shouted nicholas
banging the table very little to the point as it seemed to his
listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts
our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think thats
and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel
yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottle
in 1808 the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with
the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was
much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting
in 1809 the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as napoleon and
alexander were called was such that when napoleon declared war on
austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to co operate with our old
enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria and in
court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of
alexanders sisters was spoken of but besides considerations of foreign
policy the attention of russian society was at that time keenly
directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
life meanwhile real life with its essential interests of health and
sickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thought
science poetry music love friendship hatred and passions went on
as usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction
prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country
all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly
changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried
out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty
he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going
on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of the
kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo
at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
the children of the peasants and household serfs
prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his
son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in
bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince andrews estate
despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to
pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books
and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from
petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himself
who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home
besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our
last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a
in the spring of 1809 he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been
inherited by his son whose guardian he was
warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new
grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white
spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of
anything but looked absent mindedly and cheerfully from side to side
they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before
they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green
fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a
birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was
almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green
leaves were motionless and lilac colored flowers and the first blades
of green grass were pushing up and lifting last years leaves the
coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the
forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly
peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented
but apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for peter and he
how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile
what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i
suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is
green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are
coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak
at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the
birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as
tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man
could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged
stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the
dead looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of
that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and
always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those
cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken
and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or
my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your
as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to
look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak too
were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid
yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew
let others the young yield afresh to that fraud but we know life
a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose
in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it
were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion
restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything
anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not
prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in
connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was
trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may
it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in
green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds
of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind
some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the
path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark
haired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a
white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a
stranger ran back laughing without looking at him
suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful
the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl
did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and
cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy
life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the
military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs
quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew
in 1809 count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in
former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with
hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince
andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying
during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his
elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old counts
house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew
repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger
members of the company and asked himself each time what is she
that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he
read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the
room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the
stupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he
he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst
into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and
very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking
black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the
trees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silver lit
leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a
roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its
full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his
elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky
his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also
just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew
but when are you coming to bed replied another voice
i wont i cant sleep whats the use come now for the last time
two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song
oh how lovely now go to sleep and theres an end of it
you go to sleep but i cant said the first voice coming nearer to
the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her
dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was stone still
like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared
not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence
sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you
sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up
sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was
do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here
darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down
on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight
as tight as possible and flying away like this
he heard the sound of a scuffle and sonyas disapproving voice its
oh you only spoil things for me all right go go
again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting
there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh
o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then
if it must be and she slammed the casement
for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he
listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
might say something about him there she is again as if it were on
in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable
to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once
next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not
waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home
it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove
into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded
yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was
thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest
did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood
around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots
the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a
small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road
and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade
the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely
swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales
trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away
