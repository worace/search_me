austere countenance not well observing my shape at first view asked the
queen after a cold manner how long it was since she grew fond of a
splacnuck for such it seems he took me to be as i lay upon my breast
in her majestys right hand but this princess who has an infinite deal
of wit and humour set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire and
commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself which i did in a
very few words and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door and
could not endure i should be out of her sight being admitted confirmed
all that had passed from my arrival at her fathers house
the king although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions had
been educated in the study of philosophy and particularly mathematics
yet when he observed my shape exactly and saw me walk erect before i
began to speak conceived i might be a piece of clock work which is in
that country arrived to a very great perfection contrived by some
ingenious artist but when he heard my voice and found what i delivered
to be regular and rational he could not conceal his astonishment he
was by no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner i
came into his kingdom but thought it a story concerted between
glumdalclitch and her father who had taught me a set of words to make me
sell at a better price upon this imagination he put several other
questions to me and still received rational answers no otherwise
defective than by a foreign accent and an imperfect knowledge in the
language with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmers
house and did not suit the polite style of a court
his majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their weekly
waiting according to the custom in that country these gentlemen after
they had a while examined my shape with much nicety were of different
opinions concerning me they all agreed that i could not be produced
according to the regular laws of nature because i was not framed with a
capacity of preserving my life either by swiftness or climbing of
trees or digging holes in the earth they observed by my teeth which
they viewed with great exactness that i was a carnivorous animal yet
most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me and field mice with some
others too nimble they could not imagine how i should be able to
support myself unless i fed upon snails and other insects which they
offered by many learned arguments to evince that i could not possibly
do one of these virtuosi seemed to think that i might be an embryo or
abortive birth but this opinion was rejected by the other two who
observed my limbs to be perfect and finished and that i had lived
several years as it was manifest from my beard the stumps whereof they
plainly discovered through a magnifying glass they would not allow me
to be a dwarf because my littleness was beyond all degrees of
comparison for the queens favourite dwarf the smallest ever known in
that kingdom was near thirty feet high after much debate they
concluded unanimously that i was only relplum scalcath which is
interpreted literally lusus natur a determination exactly agreeable
to the modern philosophy of europe whose professors disdaining the old
evasion of occult causes whereby the followers of aristotle endeavoured
in vain to disguise their ignorance have invented this wonderful
solution of all difficulties to the unspeakable advancement of human
after this decisive conclusion i entreated to be heard a word or two i
applied myself to the king and assured his majesty that i came from a
country which abounded with several millions of both sexes and of my own
stature where the animals trees and houses were all in proportion
and where by consequence i might be as able to defend myself and to
find sustenance as any of his majestys subjects could do here which i
took for a full answer to those gentlemens arguments to this they
only replied with a smile of contempt saying that the farmer had
instructed me very well in my lesson the king who had a much better
understanding dismissing his learned men sent for the farmer who by
good fortune was not yet gone out of town having therefore first
examined him privately and then confronted him with me and the young
girl his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be
true he desired the queen to order that a particular care should be
taken of me and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continue
in her office of tending me because he observed we had a great affection
for each other a convenient apartment was provided for her at court
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education a
maid to dress her and two other servants for menial offices but the
care of me was wholly appropriated to herself the queen commanded her
own cabinet maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a
bedchamber after the model that glumdalclitch and i should agree upon
this man was a most ingenious artist and according to my direction in
three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square and
twelve high with sash windows a door and two closets like a london
bed chamber the board that made the ceiling was to be lifted up and
down by two hinges to put in a bed ready furnished by her majestys
upholsterer which glumdalclitch took out every day to air made it with
her own hands and letting it down at night locked up the roof over me
a nice workman who was famous for little curiosities undertook to make
me two chairs with backs and frames of a substance not unlike ivory
and two tables with a cabinet to put my things in the room was quilted
on all sides as well as the floor and the ceiling to prevent any
accident from the carelessness of those who carried me and to break the
force of a jolt when i went in a coach i desired a lock for my door
to prevent rats and mice from coming in the smith after several
attempts made the smallest that ever was seen among them for i have
known a larger at the gate of a gentlemans house in england i made a
shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own fearing glumdalclitch might
lose it the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be
gotten to make me clothes not much thicker than an english blanket
very cumbersome till i was accustomed to them they were after the
fashion of the kingdom partly resembling the persian and partly the
chinese and are a very grave and decent habit
the queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without
me i had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate just at
her left elbow and a chair to sit on glumdalclitch stood on a stool on
the floor near my table to assist and take care of me i had an entire
set of silver dishes and plates and other necessaries which in
proportion to those of the queen were not much bigger than what i have
seen in a london toy shop for the furniture of a baby house these my
little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box and gave me at meals as
i wanted them always cleaning them herself no person dined with the
queen but the two princesses royal the eldest sixteen years old and the
younger at that time thirteen and a month her majesty used to put a bit
of meat upon one of my dishes out of which i carved for myself and her
diversion was to see me eat in miniature for the queen who had indeed
but a weak stomach took up at one mouthful as much as a dozen english
farmers could eat at a meal which to me was for some time a very
nauseous sight she would craunch the wing of a lark bones and all
between her teeth although it were nine times as large as that of a
full grown turkey and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two
twelve penny loaves she drank out of a golden cup above a hogshead at
a draught her knives were twice as long as a scythe set straight upon
the handle the spoons forks and other instruments were all in the
same proportion i remember when glumdalclitch carried me out of
curiosity to see some of the tables at court where ten or a dozen of
those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together i thought i had
never till then beheld so terrible a sight
it is the custom that every wednesday which as i have observed is
their sabbath the king and queen with the royal issue of both sexes
dine together in the apartment of his majesty to whom i was now become a
great favourite and at these times my little chair and table were
placed at his left hand before one of the salt cellars this prince
took a pleasure in conversing with me inquiring into the manners
religion laws government and learning of europe wherein i gave him
the best account i was able his apprehension was so clear and his
judgment so exact that he made very wise reflections and observations
upon all i said but i confess that after i had been a little too
copious in talking of my own beloved country of our trade and wars by
sea and land of our schisms in religion and parties in the state the
prejudices of his education prevailed so far that he could not forbear
taking me up in his right hand and stroking me gently with the other
after a hearty fit of laughing asked me whether i was a whig or tory
then turning to his first minister who waited behind him with a white
staff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign he observed
how contemptible a thing was human grandeur which could be mimicked by
such diminutive insects as i and yet says he i dare engage these
creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour they contrive
little nests and burrows that they call houses and cities they make a
figure in dress and equipage they love they fight they dispute they
cheat they betray and thus he continued on while my colour came and
went several times with indignation to hear our noble country the
mistress of arts and arms the scourge of france the arbitress of
europe the seat of virtue piety honour and truth the pride and envy
but as i was not in a condition to resent injuries so upon mature
thoughts i began to doubt whether i was injured or no for after having
been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people
and observed every object upon which i cast mine eyes to be of
proportionable magnitude the horror i had at first conceived from their
bulk and aspect was so far worn off that if i had then beheld a company
of english lords and ladies in their finery and birth day clothes acting
their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting and bowing
and prating to say the truth i should have been strongly tempted to
laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me neither
indeed could i forbear smiling at myself when the queen used to place
me upon her hand towards a looking glass by which both our persons
appeared before me in full view together and there could be nothing more
ridiculous than the comparison so that i really began to imagine myself
nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queens dwarf who being
of the lowest stature that was ever in that country for i verily think
he was not full thirty feet high became so insolent at seeing a
creature so much beneath him that he would always affect to swagger and
look big as he passed by me in the queens antechamber while i was
standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court and
he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness against which
i could only revenge myself by calling him brother challenging him to
wrestle and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages
one day at dinner this malicious little cub was so nettled with
something i had said to him that raising himself upon the frame of her
majestys chair he took me up by the middle as i was sitting down not
thinking any harm and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream and
then ran away as fast as he could i fell over head and ears and if i
had not been a good swimmer it might have gone very hard with me for
glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the
room and the queen was in such a fright that she wanted presence of
mind to assist me but my little nurse ran to my relief and took me
out after i had swallowed above a quart of cream i was put to bed
however i received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes
which was utterly spoiled the dwarf was soundly whipt and as a farther
punishment forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown
me neither was he ever restored to favour for soon after the queen
bestowed him on a lady of high quality so that i saw him no more to my
very great satisfaction for i could not tell to what extremities such a
he had before served me a scurvy trick which set the queen a laughing
although at the same time she was heartily vexed and would have
immediately cashiered him if i had not been so generous as to intercede
her majesty had taken a marrow bone upon her plate and after knocking
out the marrow placed the bone again in the dish erect as it stood
before the dwarf watching his opportunity while glumdalclitch was gone
to the side board mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me
at meals took me up in both hands and squeezing my legs together
wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist where i stuck for some
time and made a very ridiculous figure i believe it was near a minute
before any one knew what was become of me for i thought it below me to
cry out but as princes seldom get their meat hot my legs were not
scalded only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition the dwarf
at my entreaty had no other punishment than a sound whipping
i was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness and
she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards
as myself the occasion was this the kingdom is much pestered with
flies in summer and these odious insects each of them as big as a
dunstable lark hardly gave me any rest while i sat at dinner with their
continual humming and buzzing about mine ears they would sometimes
alight upon my victuals and leave their loathsome excrement or spawn
behind which to me was very visible though not to the natives of that
country whose large optics were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller
objects sometimes they would fix upon my nose or forehead where they
stung me to the quick smelling very offensively and i could easily
trace that viscous matter which our naturalists tell us enables those
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling i had much ado
to defend myself against these detestable animals and could not forbear
starting when they came on my face it was the common practice of the
dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand as schoolboys do
among us and let them out suddenly under my nose on purpose to frighten
me and divert the queen my remedy was to cut them in pieces with my
knife as they flew in the air wherein my dexterity was much admired
i remember one morning when glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a
window as she usually did in fair days to give me air for i durst not
venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window as we do with
cages in england after i had lifted up one of my sashes and sat down
at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast above twenty
wasps allured by the smell came flying into the room humming louder
than the drones of as many bagpipes some of them seized my cake and
carried it piecemeal away others flew about my head and face
confounding me with the noise and putting me in the utmost terror of
their stings however i had the courage to rise and draw my hanger and
attack them in the air i dispatched four of them but the rest got
away and i presently shut my window these insects were as large as
partridges i took out their stings found them an inch and a half long
and as sharp as needles i carefully preserved them all and having
since shown them with some other curiosities in several parts of
europe upon my return to england i gave three of them to gresham
the country described a proposal for correcting modern maps the
kings palace and some account of the metropolis the authors way of
i now intend to give the reader a short description of this country as
far as i travelled in it which was not above two thousand miles round
lorbrulgrud the metropolis for the queen whom i always attended
never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses and
there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers the
whole extent of this princes dominions reaches about six thousand miles
in length and from three to five in breadth whence i cannot but
conclude that our geographers of europe are in a great error by
supposing nothing but sea between japan and california for it was ever
my opinion that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the
great continent of tartary and therefore they ought to correct their
maps and charts by joining this vast tract of land to the north west
parts of america wherein i shall be ready to lend them my assistance
the kingdom is a peninsula terminated to the north east by a ridge of
mountains thirty miles high which are altogether impassable by reason
of the volcanoes upon the tops neither do the most learned know what
sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains or whether they be
inhabited at all on the three other sides it is bounded by the ocean
there is not one seaport in the whole kingdom and those parts of the
coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed rocks and the
sea generally so rough that there is no venturing with the smallest of
their boats so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce
with the rest of the world but the large rivers are full of vessels
and abound with excellent fish for they seldom get any from the sea
because the sea fish are of the same size with those in europe and
consequently not worth catching whereby it is manifest that nature in
the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk is
wholly confined to this continent of which i leave the reasons to be
determined by philosophers however now and then they take a whale that
happens to be dashed against the rocks which the common people feed on
heartily these whales i have known so large that a man could hardly
carry one upon his shoulders and sometimes for curiosity they are
brought in hampers to lorbrulgrud i saw one of them in a dish at the
kings table which passed for a rarity but i did not observe he was
fond of it for i think indeed the bigness disgusted him although i
the country is well inhabited for it contains fifty one cities near a
hundred walled towns and a great number of villages to satisfy my
curious reader it may be sufficient to describe lorbrulgrud this city
stands upon almost two equal parts on each side the river that passes
through it contains above eighty thousand houses and about six hundred
thousand inhabitants it is in length three glomglungs which make
about fifty four english miles and two and a half in breadth as i
measured it myself in the royal map made by the kings order which was
laid on the ground on purpose for me and extended a hundred feet i
paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot and
computing by the scale measured it pretty exactly
the kings palace is no regular edifice but a heap of buildings about
seven miles round the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty
feet high and broad and long in proportion a coach was allowed to
glumdalclitch and me wherein her governess frequently took her out to
see the town or go among the shops and i was always of the party
carried in my box although the girl at my own desire would often take
me out and hold me in her hand that i might more conveniently view the
houses and the people as we passed along the streets i reckoned our
coach to be about a square of westminster hall but not altogether so
high however i cannot be very exact one day the governess ordered our
coachman to stop at several shops where the beggars watching their
opportunity crowded to the sides of the coach and gave me the most
horrible spectacle that ever a european eye beheld there was a woman
with a cancer in her breast swelled to a monstrous size full of holes
in two or three of which i could have easily crept and covered my whole
body there was a fellow with a wen in his neck larger than five
wool packs and another with a couple of wooden legs each about twenty
feet high but the most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on
their clothes i could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my
naked eye much better than those of a european louse through a
microscope and their snouts with which they rooted like swine they
were the first i had ever beheld and i should have been curious enough
to dissect one of them if i had had proper instruments which i
unluckily left behind me in the ship although indeed the sight was so
besides the large box in which i was usually carried the queen ordered a
smaller one to be made for me of about twelve feet square and ten high
for the convenience of travelling because the other was somewhat too
large for glumdalclitchs lap and cumbersome in the coach it was made
by the same artist whom i directed in the whole contrivance this
travelling closet was an exact square with a window in the middle of
three of the squares and each window was latticed with iron wire on the
outside to prevent accidents in long journeys on the fourth side
which had no window two strong staples were fixed through which the
person that carried me when i had a mind to be on horseback put a
leathern belt and buckled it about his waist this was always the
office of some grave trusty servant in whom i could confide whether i
attended the king and queen in their progresses or were disposed to see
the gardens or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in
the court when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order for i soon
began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers i suppose
more upon account of their majesties favour than any merit of my own
in journeys when i was weary of the coach a servant on horseback would
buckle on my box and place it upon a cushion before him and there i had
a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows i
had in this closet a field bed and a hammock hung from the ceiling
two chairs and a table neatly screwed to the floor to prevent being
tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach and having been
long used to sea voyages those motions although sometimes very violent
whenever i had a mind to see the town it was always in my
travelling closet which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open
sedan after the fashion of the country borne by four men and attended
by two others in the queens livery the people who had often heard of
me were very curious to crowd about the sedan and the girl was
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop and to take me in her hand
i was very desirous to see the chief temple and particularly the tower
belonging to it which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom
accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither but i may truly say i
came back disappointed for the height is not above three thousand feet
reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top which allowing
for the difference between the size of those people and us in europe is
no great matter for admiration nor at all equal in proportion if i
rightly remember to salisbury steeple but not to detract from a
nation to which during my life i shall acknowledge myself extremely
obliged it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants in
height is amply made up in beauty and strength for the walls are near a
hundred feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forty feet
square and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cut
in marble larger than the life placed in their several niches i
measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues
and lay unperceived among some rubbish and found it exactly four feet
and an inch in length glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief
and carried it home in her pocket to keep among other trinkets of which
the girl was very fond as children at her age usually are
the kings kitchen is indeed a noble building vaulted at top and about
six hundred feet high the great oven is not so wide by ten paces as
the cupola at st pauls for i measured the latter on purpose after my
return but if i should describe the kitchen grate the prodigious pots
and kettles the joints of meat turning on the spits with many other
particulars perhaps i should be hardly believed at least a severe
critic would be apt to think i enlarged a little as travellers are often
suspected to do to avoid which censure i fear i have run too much into
the other extreme and that if this treatise should happen to be
translated into the language of brobdingnag which is the general name of
that kingdom and transmitted thither the king and his people would
have reason to complain that i had done them an injury by a false and
his majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables they
are generally from fifty four to sixty feet high but when he goes
abroad on solemn days he is attended for state by a military guard of
five hundred horse which indeed i thought was the most splendid sight
that could be ever beheld till i saw part of his army in battalia
whereof i shall find another occasion to speak
several adventurers that happened to the author the execution of a
criminal the author shows his skill in navigation
i should have lived happy enough in that country if my littleness had
not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents some of
which i shall venture to relate glumdalclitch often carried me into the
gardens of the court in my smaller box and would sometimes take me out
of it and hold me in her hand or set me down to walk i remember
before the dwarf left the queen he followed us one day into those
gardens and my nurse having set me down he and i being close together
near some dwarf apple trees i must needs show my wit by a silly
allusion between him and the trees which happens to hold in their
language as it does in ours whereupon the malicious rogue watching
his opportunity when i was walking under one of them shook it directly
over my head by which a dozen apples each of them near as large as a
bristol barrel came tumbling about my ears one of them hit me on the
back as i chanced to stoop and knocked me down flat on my face but i
received no other hurt and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire because
another day glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess in the
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail that i was
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground and when i was
down the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if i
had been pelted with tennis balls however i made a shift to creep on
all fours and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the lee side
of a border of lemon thyme but so bruised from head to foot that i
could not go abroad in ten days neither is this at all to be wondered
at because nature in that country observing the same proportion
through all her operations a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as
large as one in europe which i can assert upon experience having been
so curious as to weigh and measure them
but a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden when my
little nurse believing she had put me in a secure place which i often
entreated her to do that i might enjoy my own thoughts and having left
my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it went to another part
of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance
while she was absent and out of hearing a small white spaniel that
belonged to one of the chief gardeners having got by accident into the
garden happened to range near the place where i lay the dog following
the scent came directly up and taking me in his mouth ran straight to
his master wagging his tail and set me gently on the ground by good
fortune he had been so well taught that i was carried between his teeth
without the least hurt or even tearing my clothes but the poor
gardener who knew me well and had a great kindness for me was in a
terrible fright he gently took me up in both his hands and asked me how
i did but i was so amazed and out of breath that i could not speak a
word in a few minutes i came to myself and he carried me safe to my
little nurse who by this time had returned to the place where she left
me and was in cruel agonies when i did not appear nor answer when she
called she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog
but the thing was hushed up and never known at court for the girl was
afraid of the queens anger and truly as to myself i thought it would
not be for my reputation that such a story should go about
this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me
abroad for the future out of her sight i had been long afraid of this
resolution and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
adventures that happened in those times when i was left by myself once
a kite hovering over the garden made a stoop at me and if i had not
resolutely drawn my hanger and run under a thick espalier he would have
certainly carried me away in his talons another time walking to the
top of a fresh mole hill i fell to my neck in the hole through which
that animal had cast up the earth and coined some lie not worth
remembering to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes i likewise broke
my right shin against the shell of a snail which i happened to stumble
over as i was walking alone and thinking on poor england
i cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe in
those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all
afraid of me but would hop about within a yards distance looking for
worms and other food with as much indifference and security as if no
creature at all were near them i remember a thrush had the confidence
to snatch out of my hand with his bill a of cake that glumdalclitch had
just given me for my breakfast when i attempted to catch any of these
birds they would boldly turn against me endeavouring to peck my
fingers which i durst not venture within their reach and then they
would hop back unconcerned to hunt for worms or snails as they did
before but one day i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all my
strength so luckily at a linnet that i knocked him down and seizing
him by the neck with both my hands ran with him in triumph to my nurse
however the bird who had only been stunned recovering himself gave me
so many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body though i
held him at arms length and was out of the reach of his claws that i
was twenty times thinking to let him go but i was soon relieved by one
of our servants who wrung off the birds neck and i had him next day
for dinner by the queens command this linnet as near as i can
remember seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swan
the maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments and
desired she would bring me along with her on purpose to have the
pleasure of seeing and touching me they would often strip me naked from
top to toe and lay me at full length in their bosoms wherewith i was
much disgusted because to say the truth a very offensive smell came
from their skins which i do not mention or intend to the disadvantage
of those excellent ladies for whom i have all manner of respect but i
conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness and
that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers
or to each other than people of the same quality are with us in england
and after all i found their natural smell was much more supportable
than when they used perfumes under which i immediately swooned away i
cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took the
freedom in a warm day when i had used a good deal of exercise to
complain of a strong smell about me although i am as little faulty that
way as most of my sex but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice
with regard to me as mine was to that of this people upon this point
i cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress and
glumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady
that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour when my
nurse carried me to visit then was to see them use me without any
manner of ceremony like a creature who had no sort of consequence for
they would strip themselves to the skin and put on their smocks in my
presence while i was placed on their toilet directly before their naked
bodies which i am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight
or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust
their skins appeared so coarse and uneven so variously coloured when i
saw them near with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher and
hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads to say nothing farther
concerning the rest of their persons neither did they at all scruple
while i was by to discharge what they had drank to the quantity of at
least two hogsheads in a vessel that held above three tuns the
handsomest among these maids of honour a pleasant frolicsome girl of
sixteen would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples with
many other tricks wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over
particular but i was so much displeased that i entreated glumdalclitch
to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more
one day a young gentleman who was nephew to my nurses governess came
and pressed them both to see an execution it was of a man who had
murdered one of that gentlemans intimate acquaintance glumdalclitch
was prevailed on to be of the company very much against her inclination
for she was naturally tender hearted and as for myself although i
abhorred such kind of spectacles yet my curiosity tempted me to see
something that i thought must be extraordinary the malefactor was fixed
in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose and his head cut off
at one blow with a sword of about forty feet long the veins and
arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and so high in
the air that the great jet deau at versailles was not equal to it for
the time it lasted and the head when it fell on the scaffold floor
gave such a bounce as made me start although i was at least half an
the queen who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages and took all
occasions to divert me when i was melancholy asked me whether i
understood how to handle a sail or an oar and whether a little exercise
of rowing might not be convenient for my health i answered that i
understood both very well for although my proper employment had been to
be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i was forced
to work like a common mariner but i could not see how this could be
done in their country where the smallest wherry was equal to a
first rate man of war among us and such a boat as i could manage would
never live in any of their rivers her majesty said if i would contrive
a boat her own joiner should make it and she would provide a place for
me to sail in the fellow was an ingenious workman and by my
instructions in ten days finished a pleasure boat with all its
tackling able conveniently to hold eight europeans when it was
finished the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap to
the king who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water with me
in it by way of trial where i could not manage my two sculls or little
oars for want of room but the queen had before contrived another
project she ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred
feet long fifty broad and eight deep which being well pitched to
prevent leaking was placed on the floor along the wall in an outer
room of the palace it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water
when it began to grow stale and two servants could easily fill it in
half an hour here i often used to row for my own diversion as well as
that of the queen and her ladies who thought themselves well entertained
with my skill and agility sometimes i would put up my sail and then my
business was only to steer while the ladies gave me a gale with their
fans and when they were weary some of their pages would blow my sail
forward with their breath while i showed my art by steering starboard or
larboard as i pleased when i had done glumdalclitch always carried
back my boat into her closet and hung it on a nail to dry
in this exercise i once met an accident which had like to have cost me
my life for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough the
governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up to
place me in the boat but i happened to slip through her fingers and
should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor if by the
luckiest chance in the world i had not been stopped by a corking pin
that stuck in the good gentlewomans stomacher the head of the pin
passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches and thus i was
held by the middle in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief
another time one of the servants whose office it was to fill my trough
every third day with fresh water was so careless as to let a huge frog
not perceiving it slip out of his pail the frog lay concealed till i
was put into my boat but then seeing a resting place climbed up and
made it lean so much on one side that i was forced to balance it with
all my weight on the other to prevent overturning when the frog was
got in it hopped at once half the length of the boat and then over my
head backward and forward daubing my face and clothes with its odious
slime the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed
animal that can be conceived however i desired glumdalclitch to let me
deal with it alone i banged it a good while with one of my sculls and
at last forced it to leap out of the boat
but the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom was from a
monkey who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen glumdalclitch
had locked me up in her closet while she went somewhere upon business
or a visit the weather being very warm the closet window was left
open as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box in which i
usually lived because of its largeness and conveniency as i sat
quietly meditating at my table i heard something bounce in at the
closet window and skip about from one side to the other whereat
although i was much alarmed yet i ventured to look out but not stirring
from my seat and then i saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping
up and down till at last he came to my box which he seemed to view with
great pleasure and curiosity peeping in at the door and every window i
retreated to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkey
looking in at every side put me in such a fright that i wanted presence
of mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easily have done
after some time spent in peeping grinning and chattering he at last
espied me and reaching one of his paws in at the door as a cat does
when she plays with a mouse although i often shifted place to avoid him
he at length seized the lappet of my coat which being made of that
country silk was very thick and strong and dragged me out he took me
up in his right fore foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is
going to suckle just as i have seen the same sort of creature do with a
kitten in europe and when i offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard
that i thought it more prudent to submit i have good reason to believe
that he took me for a young one of his own species by his often stroking
my face very gently with his other paw in these diversions he was
interrupted by a noise at the closet door as if somebody were opening
it whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come
in and thence upon the leads and gutters walking upon three legs and
holding me in the fourth till he clambered up to a roof that was next to
ours i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying
me out the poor girl was almost distracted that quarter of the palace
was all in an uproar the servants ran for ladders the monkey was seen
by hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of a building holding
me like a baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me with the other by
cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on
one side of his chaps and patting me when i would not eat whereat many
of the rabble below could not forbear laughing neither do i think they
justly ought to be blamed for without question the sight was
ridiculous enough to every body but myself some of the people threw up
stones hoping to drive the monkey down but this was strictly forbidden
or else very probably my brains had been dashed out
the ladders were now applied and mounted by several men which the
monkey observing and finding himself almost encompassed not being able
to make speed enough with his three legs let me drop on a ridge tile
and made his escape here i sat for some time five hundred yards from
the ground expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind or to
fall by my own giddiness and come tumbling over and over from the ridge
to the eaves but an honest lad one of my nurses footmen climbed up
and putting me into his breeches pocket brought me down safe
i was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my
throat but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small
needle and then i fell a vomiting which gave me great relief yet i
was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this
odious animal that i was forced to keep my bed a fortnight the king
queen and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health and
her majesty made me several visits during my sickness the monkey was
killed and an order made that no such animal should be kept about the
when i attended the king after my recovery to return him thanks for his
favours he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure he
asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while i lay in the
monkeys paw how i liked the victuals he gave me his manner of feeding
and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach he
desired to know what i would have done upon such an occasion in my own
country i told his majesty that in europe we had no monkeys except
such as were brought for curiosity from other places and so small that
i could deal with a dozen of them together if they presumed to attack
me and as for that monstrous animal with whom i was so lately engaged
it was indeed as large as an elephant if my fears had suffered me to
think so far as to make use of my hanger looking fiercely and
clapping my hand on the hilt as i spoke when he poked his paw into my
chamber perhaps i should have given him such a wound as would have made
him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in this i
delivered in a firm tone like a person who was jealous lest his courage
should be called in question however my speech produced nothing else
beside a laud laughter which all the respect due to his majesty from
those about him could not make them contain this made me reflect how
vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among
those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him and
yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england
since my return where a little contemptible varlet without the least
title to birth person wit or common sense shall presume to look with
importance and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the
i was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story and
glumdalclitch although she loved me to excess yet was arch enough to
inform the queen whenever i committed any folly that she thought would
be diverting to her majesty the girl who had been out of order was
carried by her governess to take the air about an hours distance or
thirty miles from town they alighted out of the coach near a small
foot path in a field and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box i
went out of it to walk there was a cow dung in the path and i must
need try my activity by attempting to leap over it i took a run but
unfortunately jumped short and found myself just in the middle up to my
knees i waded through with some difficulty and one of the footmen
wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief for i was filthily
bemired and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home where
the queen was soon informed of what had passed and the footmen spread it
about the court so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense
several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen he
shows his skill in music the king inquires into the state of england
which the author relates to him the kings observations thereon
i used to attend the kings levee once or twice a week and had often
seen him under the barbers hand which indeed was at first very terrible
to behold for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe
his majesty according to the custom of the country was only shaved
twice a week i once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds
or lather out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps
of hair i then took a piece of fine wood and cut it like the back of a
comb making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a
needle as i could get from glumdalclitch i fixed in the stumps so
artificially scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points
that i made a very tolerable comb which was a seasonable supply my own
being so much broken in the teeth that it was almost useless neither
did i know any artist in that country so nice and exact as would
and this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein i spent many of my
leisure hours i desired the queens woman to save for me the combings
of her majestys hair whereof in time i got a good quantity and
consulting with my friend the cabinet maker who had received general
orders to do little jobs for me i directed him to make two chair frames
no larger than those i had in my box and to bore little holes with a
fine awl round those parts where i designed the backs and seats through
these holes i wove the strongest hairs i could pick out just after the
manner of cane chairs in england when they were finished i made a
present of them to her majesty who kept them in her cabinet and used to
show them for curiosities as indeed they were the wonder of every one
that beheld them the queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs
but i absolutely refused to obey her protesting i would rather die than
place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs that once
adorned her majestys head of these hairs as i had always a mechanical
genius i likewise made a neat little purse about five feet long with
her majestys name deciphered in gold letters which i gave to
glumdalclitch by the queens consent to say the truth it was more for
show than use being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger
coins and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that
the king who delighted in music had frequent concerts at court to
which i was sometimes carried and set in my box on a table to hear them
but the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes i
am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army beating and
sounding together just at your ears could not equal it my practice was
to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat as far as
i could then to shut the doors and windows of it and draw the window
curtains after which i found their music not disagreeable
i had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet
glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber and a master attended twice a week
to teach her i called it a spinet because it somewhat resembled that
instrument and was played upon in the same manner a fancy came into my
head that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon
this instrument but this appeared extremely difficult for the spinet
was near sixty feet long each key being almost a foot wide so that with
my arms extended i could not reach to above five keys and to press them
down required a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great
a labour and to no purpose the method i contrived was this i prepared
two round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels they were thicker
at one end than the other and i covered the thicker ends with pieces of
a mouses skin that by rapping on them i might neither damage the tops
of the keys nor interrupt the sound before the spinet a bench was
placed about four feet below the keys and i was put upon the bench i
ran sideling upon it that way and this as fast as i could banging the
proper keys with my two sticks and made a shift to play a jig to the
great satisfaction of both their majesties but it was the most violent
exercise i ever underwent and yet i could not strike above sixteen keys
nor consequently play the bass and treble together as other artists do
which was a great disadvantage to my performance
the king who as i before observed was a prince of excellent
understanding would frequently order that i should be brought in my box
and set upon the table in his closet he would then command me to bring
one of my chairs out of the box and sit down within three yards distance
upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with his
face in this manner i had several conversations with him i one day
took the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt he discovered
towards europe and the rest of the world did not seem answerable to
those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of that reason did
not extend itself with the bulk of the body on the contrary we observed
in our country that the tallest persons were usually the least provided
with it that among other animals bees and ants had the reputation of
more industry art and sagacity than many of the larger kinds and
that as inconsiderable as he took me to be i hoped i might live to do
his majesty some signal service the king heard me with attention and
began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before
he desired i would give him as exact an account of the government of
england as i possibly could because as fond as princes commonly are of
their own customs for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my former
discourses he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve
imagine with thyself courteous reader how often i then wished for the
tongue of demosthenes or cicero that might have enabled me to celebrate
the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits
i began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions
consisted of two islands which composed three mighty kingdoms under one
sovereign beside our plantations in america i dwelt long upon the
fertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate i then spoke
at large upon the constitution of an english parliament partly made up
of an illustrious body called the house of peers persons of the noblest
blood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies i described that
extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms to
qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom to have
a share in the legislature to be members of the highest court of
judicature whence there can be no appeal and to be champions always
ready for the defence of their prince and country by their valour
conduct and fidelity that these were the ornament and bulwark of the
kingdom worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors whose honour
had been the reward of their virtue from which their posterity were
never once known to degenerate to these were joined several holy
persons as part of that assembly under the title of bishops whose
peculiar business is to take care of religion and of those who instruct
the people therein these were searched and sought out through the whole
nation by the prince and his wisest counsellors among such of the
priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their
lives and the depth of their erudition who were indeed the spiritual
that the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the
house of commons who were all principal gentlemen freely picked and
culled out by the people themselves for their great abilities and love
of their country to represent the wisdom of the whole nation and that
these two bodies made up the most august assembly in europe to whom in
conjunction with the prince the whole legislature is committed
i then descended to the courts of justice over which the judges those
venerable sages and interpreters of the law presided for determining
the disputed rights and properties of men as well as for the punishment
of vice and protection of innocence i mentioned the prudent management
of our treasury the valour and achievements of our forces by sea and
land i computed the number of our people by reckoning how many
millions there might be of each religious sect or political party among
us i did not omit even our sports and pastimes or any other particular
which i thought might redound to the honour of my country and i
finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in
this conversation was not ended under five audiences each of several
hours and the king heard the whole with great attention frequently
taking notes of what i spoke as well as memorandums of what questions he
when i had put an end to these long discources his majesty in a sixth
audience consulting his notes proposed many doubts queries and
objections upon every article he asked what methods were used to
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility and in what kind of
business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their
lives what course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble
family became extinct what qualifications were necessary in those who
are to be created new lords whether the humour of the prince a sum of
money to a court lady or a design of strengthening a party opposite to
the public interest ever happened to be the motive in those
advancements what share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of
their country and how they came by it so as to enable them to decide
the properties of their fellow subjects in the last resort whether they
were always so free from avarice partialities or want that a bribe or
some other sinister view could have no place among them whether those
holy lords i spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of
their knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of their lives
had never been compliers with the times while they were common priests
or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman whose opinions they
continued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that
he then desired to know what arts were practised in electing those whom
i called commoners whether a stranger with a strong purse might not
influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord or
the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood how it came to
pass that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly
which i allowed to be a great trouble and expense often to the ruin of
their families without any salary or pension because this appeared such
an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit that his majesty seemed to
doubt it might possibly not be always sincere and he desired to know
whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding
themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the
public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction
with a corrupted ministry he multiplied his questions and sifted me
thoroughly upon every part of this head proposing numberless inquiries
and objections which i think it not prudent or convenient to repeat
upon what i said in relation to our courts of justice his majesty
desired to be satisfied in several points and this i was the better able
to do having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery
which was decreed for me with costs he asked what time was usually
spent in determining between right and wrong and what degree of expense
whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly
known to be unjust vexatious or oppressive whether party in religion
or politics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice
whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general
knowledge of equity or only in provincial national and other local
customs whether they or their judges had any part in penning those
laws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing upon
at their pleasure whether they had ever at different times pleaded
for and against the same cause and cited precedents to prove contrary
opinions whether they were a rich or a poor corporation whether they
received any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering their opinions
and particularly whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower
he fell next upon the management of our treasury and said he thought
my memory had failed me because i computed our taxes at about five or
six millions a year and when i came to mention the issues he found they
sometimes amounted to more than double for the notes he had taken were
very particular in this point because he hoped as he told me that the
knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him and he could not be
deceived in his calculations but if what i told him were true he was
still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a private
person he asked me who were our creditors and where we found money
to pay them he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and
expensive wars that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people or live
among very bad neighbours and that our generals must needs be richer
than our kings he asked what business we had out of our own islands
unless upon the score of trade or treaty or to defend the coasts with
our fleet above all he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary
standing army in the midst of peace and among a free people he said
if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our
representatives he could not imagine of whom we were afraid or against
whom we were to fight and would hear my opinion whether a private mans
house might not be better defended by himself his children and family
than by half a dozen rascals picked up at a venture in the streets for
small wages who might get a hundred times more by cutting their
he laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic as he was pleased to call it
in reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from the
several sects among us in religion and politics he said he knew no
reason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public
should be obliged to change or should not be obliged to conceal them
and as it was tyranny in any government to require the first so it was
weakness not to enforce the second for a man may be allowed to keep
poisons in his closet but not to vend them about for cordials
he observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry i had
mentioned gaming he desired to know at what age this entertainment was
usually taken up and when it was laid down how much of their time it
employed whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes
whether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might not
arrive at great riches and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence
as well as habituate them to vile companions wholly take them from the
improvement of their minds and force them by the losses they received
to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others
he was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our
affairs during the last century protesting it was only a heap of
the very worst effects that avarice faction hypocrisy perfidiousness
cruelty rage madness hatred envy lust malice and ambition could
his majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the
sum of all i had spoken compared the questions he made with the answers
i had given then taking me into his hands and stroking me gently
delivered himself in these words which i shall never forget nor the
manner he spoke them in my little friend grildrig you have made a most
admirable panegyric upon your country you have clearly proved that
ignorance idleness and vice are the proper ingredients for qualifying
a legislator that laws are best explained interpreted and applied by
those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting confounding and
eluding them i observe among you some lines of an institution which
in its original might have been tolerable but these half erased and
the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions it does not appear
from all you have said how any one perfection is required toward the
procurement of any one station among you much less that men are
ennobled on account of their virtue that priests are advanced for their
piety or learning soldiers for their conduct or valour judges for
their integrity senators for the love of their country or counsellors
for their wisdom as for yourself continued the king who have spent
the greatest part of your life in travelling i am well disposed to hope
you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country but by what i
have gathered from your own relation and the answers i have with much
