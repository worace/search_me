him on her back he gave him the torch and don quixote bade him follow
the track of his companions and beg pardon of them on his part for the
wrong which he could not help doing them
and said sancho if by chance these gentlemen should want to know who
was the hero that served them so your worship may tell them that he is
the famous don quixote of la mancha otherwise called the knight of the
i forgot to mention that before he did so he said to don quixote
remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on
a holy thing juxta illud si quis suadente diabolo
i do not understand that latin answered don quixote but i know well
i did not lay hands only this pike besides i did not think i was
committing an assault upon priests or things of the church which like a
catholic and faithful christian as i am i respect and revere but upon
phantoms and spectres of the other world but even so i remember how it
fared with cid ruy diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that
king before his holiness the pope who excommunicated him for the same
and yet the good roderick of vivar bore himself that day like a very
on hearing this the bachelor took his departure as has been said
without making any reply and don quixote asked sancho what had induced
him to call him the knight of the rueful countenance more then than at
i will tell you answered sancho it was because i have been looking
at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate
and verily your worship has got of late the most ill favoured countenance
i ever saw it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat or
else to the want of teeth and grinders
it is not that replied don quixote but because the sage whose duty
it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it
proper that i should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore
did one being he of the burning sword another he of the unicorn
this one he of the damsels that he of the phoenix another the
knight of the griffin and another he of the death and by these names
and designations they were known all the world round and so i say that
the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to
call me the knight of the rueful countenance as i intend to call
myself from this day forward and that the said name may fit me better i
mean when the opportunity offers to have a very rueful countenance
there is no occasion senor for wasting time or money on making that
countenance said sancho for all that need be done is for your worship
to show your own face to face to those who look at you and without
anything more either image or shield they will call you him of the
rueful countenance and believe me i am telling you the truth for i
assure you senor and in good part be it said hunger and the loss of
your grinders have given you such an ill favoured face that as i say
the rueful picture may be very well spared
don quixote laughed at sanchos pleasantry nevertheless he resolved to
call himself by that name and have his shield or buckler painted as he
don quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were
bones or not but sancho would not have it saying
senor you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself
than any of those i have seen perhaps these people though beaten and
routed may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten
them and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in
search of us and give us trouble enough the ass is in proper trim the
mountains are near at hand hunger presses we have nothing more to do
but make good our retreat and as the saying is the dead to the grave
and driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow who
feeling that sancho was right did so without replying and after
proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves
in a wide and retired valley where they alighted and sancho unloaded
his beast and stretched upon the green grass with hunger for sauce
they breakfasted dined lunched and supped all at once satisfying
their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead
mans clerical gentlemen who seldom put themselves on short allowance
had brought with them on their sumpter mule but another piece of
ill luck befell them which sancho held the worst of all and that was
that they had no wine to drink nor even water to moisten their lips and
as thirst tormented them sancho observing that the meadow where they
were was full of green and tender grass said what will be told in the
of the unexampled and unheard of adventure which was achieved by the
valiant don quixote of la mancha with less peril than any ever achieved
it cannot be senor but that this grass is a proof that there must be
hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture so it would be well to
move a little farther on that we may find some place where we may quench
this terrible thirst that plagues us which beyond a doubt is more
the advice seemed good to don quixote and he leading rocinante by the
bridle and sancho the ass by the halter after he had packed away upon
him the remains of the supper they advanced the meadow feeling their
way for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything
but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water as if
falling from great rocks struck their ears the sound cheered them
greatly but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came
they heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the
sound of the water gave them especially for sancho who was by nature
timid and faint hearted they heard i say strokes falling with a
measured beat and a certain rattling of iron and chains that together
with the furious din of the water would have struck terror into any
heart but don quixotes the night was as has been said dark and they
had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees whose leaves
stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound so that what with
the solitude the place the darkness the noise of the water and the
rustling of the leaves everything inspired awe and dread more
especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease nor the wind
lull nor morning approach to all which might be added their ignorance
but don quixote supported by his intrepid heart leaped on rocinante
and bracing his buckler on his arm brought his pike to the slope and
said friend sancho know that i by heavens will have been born in this
our iron age to revive revive in it the age of gold or the golden as it
is called i am he for whom perils mighty achievements and valiant
deeds are reserved i am i say again he who is to revive the knights of
the round table the twelve of france and the nine worthies and he who
is to consign to oblivion the platirs the tablantes the olivantes and
tirantes the phoebuses and belianises with the whole herd of famous
knights errant of days gone by performing in these in which i live such
exploits marvels and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest
deeds thou dost mark well faithful and trusty squire the gloom of this
night its strange silence the dull confused murmur of those trees the
awful sound of that water in quest of which we came that seems as though
it were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of
the moon and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears
which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear
dread and dismay into the breast of mars himself much more into one not
used to hazards and adventures of the kind well then all this that i
put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit making my
heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure
arduous as it promises to be therefore tighten rocinantes girths a
little and god be with thee wait for me here three days and no more
and if in that time i come not back thou canst return to our village
and thence to do me a favour and a service thou wilt go to el toboso
where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady dulcinea that her captive
knight hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being
when sancho heard his masters words he began to weep in the most
senor i know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful
adventure it is night now no one sees us here we can easily turn about
and take ourselves out of danger even if we dont drink for three days
to come and as there is no one to see us all the less will there be
anyone to set us down as cowards besides i have many a time heard the
curate of our village whom your worship knows well preach that he who
seeks danger perishes in it so it is not right to tempt god by trying so
tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle
and heaven has performed enough of them for your worship in delivering
you from being blanketed as i was and bringing you out victorious and
safe and sound from among all those enemies that were with the dead man
and if all this does not move or soften that hard heart let this thought
and reflection move it that you will have hardly quitted this spot when
from pure fear i shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it i
left home and wife and children to come and serve your worship trusting
to do better and not worse but as covetousness bursts the bag it has
rent my hopes asunder for just as i had them highest about getting that
wretched unlucky island your worship has so often promised me i see that
instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far
from human reach for gods sake master mine deal not so unjustly by
me and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting this feat
at least put it off till morning for by what the lore i learned when i
was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now because
the mouth of the horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the
how canst thou see sancho said don quixote where it makes that
line or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of when
the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole
thats true said sancho but fear has sharp eyes and sees things
underground much more above in heavens besides there is good reason to
show that it now wants but little of day
let it want what it may replied don quixote it shall not be said of
me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing
what was in accordance with knightly usage and so i beg of thee sancho
to hold thy peace for god who has put it into my heart to undertake now
this so unexampled and terrible adventure will take care to watch over
my safety and console thy sorrow what thou hast to do is to tighten
rocinantes girths well and wait here for i shall come back shortly
sancho perceiving it his masters final resolve and how little his
tears counsels and entreaties prevailed with him determined to have
recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him if he could to wait till
daylight and so while tightening the girths of the horse he quietly
and without being felt with his ass halter tied both rocinantes legs
so that when don quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could
only move by jumps seeing the success of his trick sancho panza said
see there senor heaven moved by my tears and prayers has so ordered
it that rocinante cannot stir and if you will be obstinate and spur and
strike him you will only provoke fortune and kick as they say against
don quixote at this grew desperate but the more he drove his heels into
the horse the less he stirred him and not having any suspicion of the
tying he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until
rocinante could move firmly persuaded that all this came of something
other than sanchos ingenuity so he said to him as it is so sancho
and as rocinante cannot move i am content to wait till dawn smiles upon
us even though i weep while it delays its coming
there is no need to weep answered sancho for i will amuse your
worship by telling stories from this till daylight unless indeed you
like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after
the fashion of knights errant so as to be fresher when day comes and the
moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are
what art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for said don
quixote am i thinkest thou one of those knights that take their rest
in the presence of danger sleep thou who art born to sleep or do as
thou wilt for i will act as i think most consistent with my character
be not angry master mine replied sancho i did not mean to say
that and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the
saddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his masters left
thigh in his embrace not daring to separate a fingers width from him
so much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular
beat don quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had
proposed to which sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he
heard would let him still said he i will strive to tell a story
which if i can manage to relate it and nobody interferes with the
telling is the best of stories and let your worship give me your
attention for here i begin what was was and may the good that is to
come be for all and the evil for him who goes to look for it your
worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their
tales was not just as each one pleased it was a maxim of cato zonzorino
the roman that says the evil for him that goes to look for it and it
comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger to show that your
worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter and
that we should go back by some other road since nobody forces us to
follow this in which so many terrors affright us
go on with thy story sancho said don quixote and leave the choice
i say then continued sancho that in a village of estremadura there
was a goat shepherd that is to say one who tended goats which shepherd
or goatherd as my story goes was called lope ruiz and this lope ruiz
was in love with a shepherdess called torralva which shepherdess called
torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier and this rich grazier 
if that is the way thou tellest thy tale sancho said don quixote
repeating twice all thou hast to say thou wilt not have done these two
days go straight on with it and tell it like a reasonable man or else
tales are always told in my country in the very way i am telling this
answered sancho and i cannot tell it in any other nor is it right of
your worship to ask me to make new customs
tell it as thou wilt replied don quixote and as fate will have it
that i cannot help listening to thee go on
and so lord of my soul continued sancho as i have said this
shepherd was in love with torralva the shepherdess who was a wild buxom
lass with something of the look of a man about her for she had little
i did not know her said sancho but he who told me the story said it
was so true and certain that when i told it to another i might safely
declare and swear i had seen it all myself and so in course of time the
devil who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion contrived that
the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and
ill will and the reason according to evil tongues was some little
jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden
ground and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward
that in order to escape from her he determined to quit the country and
go where he should never set eyes on her again torralva when she found
herself spurned by lope was immediately smitten with love for him
that is the natural way of women said don quixote to scorn the one
that loves them and love the one that hates them go on sancho
it came to pass said sancho that the shepherd carried out his
intention and driving his goats before him took his way across the
plains of estremadura to pass over into the kingdom of portugal
torralva who knew of it went after him and on foot and barefoot
followed him at a distance with a pilgrims staff in her hand and a
scrip round her neck in which she carried it is said a bit of
looking glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint
for her face but let her carry what she did i am not going to trouble
myself to prove it all i say is that the shepherd they say came with
his flock to cross over the river guadiana which was at that time
swollen and almost overflowing its banks and at the spot he came to
there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to
the other side at which he was much vexed for he perceived that
torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with her
tears and entreaties however he went looking about so closely that he
discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small that it
could only hold one person and one goat but for all that he spoke to him
and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across
the fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over he came back
and carried another over he came back again and again brought over
another let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking
across for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story
and it will be impossible to tell another word of it to proceed i must
tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery and
the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming still he
returned for another goat and another and another
take it for granted he brought them all across said don quixote and
dont keep going and coming in this way or thou wilt not make an end of
how many have gone across so far said sancho
how the devil do i know replied don quixote
there it is said sancho what i told you that you must keep a good
count well then by god there is an end of the story for there is no
how can that be said don quixote is it so essential to the story to
know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over that if there be a
mistake of one in the reckoning thou canst not go on with it
no senor not a bit replied sancho for when i asked your worship to
tell me how many goats had crossed and you answered you did not know at
that very instant all i had to say passed away out of my memory and
faith there was much virtue in it and entertainment
so then said don quixote the story has come to an end
as much as my mother has said sancho
in truth said don quixote thou hast told one of the rarest stories
tales or histories that anyone in the world could have imagined and
such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a
lifetime though i expected nothing else from thy excellent
understanding but i do not wonder for perhaps those ceaseless strokes
all that may be replied sancho but i know that as to my story all
that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of
let it end where it will well and good said don quixote and let us
see if rocinante can go and again he spurred him and again rocinante
made jumps and remained where he was so well tied was he
just then whether it was the cold of the morning that was now
approaching or that he had eaten something laxative at supper or that
it was only natural as is most likely sancho felt a desire to do what
no one could do for him but so great was the fear that had penetrated
his heart he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as
the black of his nail to escape doing what he wanted was however also
impossible so what he did for peaces sake was to remove his right hand
which held the back of the saddle and with it to untie gently and
silently the running string which alone held up his breeches so that on
loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters he then
raised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters no slim
ones but this accomplished which he fancied was all he had to do to
get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment another still greater
difficulty presented itself for it seemed to him impossible to relieve
himself without making some noise and he ground his teeth and squeezed
his shoulders together holding his breath as much as he could but in
spite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little
noise very different from that which was causing him so much fear
don quixote hearing it said what noise is that sancho
i dont know senor said he it must be something new for adventures
and misadventures never begin with a trifle once more he tried his
luck and succeeded so well that without any further noise or
disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so
much discomfort but as don quixotes sense of smell was as acute as his
hearing and as sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose
almost in a straight line it could not be but that some should reach his
nose and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it
between his fingers saying in a rather snuffing tone sancho it
i am answered sancho but how does your worship perceive it now more
because just now thou smellest stronger than ever and not of
very likely said sancho but thats not my fault but your worships
for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces
then go back three or four my friend said don quixote all the time
with his fingers to his nose and for the future pay more attention to
thy person and to what thou owest to mine for it is my great familiarity
ill bet replied sancho that your worship thinks i have done
it makes it worse to stir it friend sancho returned don quixote
with this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the
night till sancho perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace very
cautiously untied rocinante and tied up his breeches as soon as
rocinante found himself free though by nature he was not at all
mettlesome he seemed to feel lively and began pawing for as to
capering begging his pardon he knew not what it meant don quixote
then observing that rocinante could move took it as a good sign and a
signal that he should attempt the dread adventure by this time day had
fully broken and everything showed distinctly and don quixote saw that
he was among some tall trees chestnuts which cast a very deep shade he
perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease but could
not discover what caused it and so without any further delay he let
rocinante feel the spur and once more taking leave of sancho he told
him to wait for him there three days at most as he had said before and
if he should not have returned by that time he might feel sure it had
been gods will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure
he again repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on
his behalf to his lady dulcinea and said he was not to be uneasy as to
the payment of his services for before leaving home he had made his
will in which he would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of
wages in due proportion to the time he had served but if god delivered
him safe sound and unhurt out of that danger he might look upon the
promised island as much more than certain sancho began to weep afresh on
again hearing the affecting words of his good master and resolved to
stay with him until the final issue and end of the business from these
tears and this honourable resolve of sancho panzas the author of this
history infers that he must have been of good birth and at least an old
christian and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to
make him show any weakness on the contrary hiding what he felt as well
as he could he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of
the water and of the strokes seemed to come
sancho followed him on foot leading by the halter as his custom was
his ass his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity and advancing
some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little
meadow at the foot of some high rocks down which a mighty rush of water
flung itself at the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed
houses looking more like ruins than houses from among which came they
perceived the din and clatter of blows which still continued without
intermission rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the
blows but quieting him don quixote advanced step by step towards the
houses commending himself with all his heart to his lady imploring her
support in that dread pass and enterprise and on the way commending
himself to god too not to forget him sancho who never quitted his
side stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs
of rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him
such fear and apprehension they went it might be a hundred paces
farther when on turning a corner the true cause beyond the possibility
of any mistake of that dread sounding and to them awe inspiring noise
that had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity appeared
plain and obvious and it was if reader thou art not disgusted and
disappointed six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made
when don quixote perceived what it was he was struck dumb and rigid from
head to foot sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down
upon his breast in manifest mortification and don quixote glanced at
sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of
laughter and evidently ready to explode with it and in spite of his
vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him and when sancho
saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides
with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter four times
he stopped and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the
same violence as at first whereat don quixote grew furious above all
when he heard him say mockingly thou must know friend sancho that of
heavens will i was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden
or age of gold i am he for whom are reserved perils mighty
achievements valiant deeds and here he went on repeating the words
that don quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes
don quixote then seeing that sancho was turning him into ridicule was
so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such
blows that if instead of catching them on his shoulders he had caught
them on his head there would have been no wages to pay unless indeed to
his heirs sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest
for his jest and fearing his master might carry it still further said
to him very humbly calm yourself sir for by god i am only joking
well then if you are joking i am not replied don quixote look
here my lively gentleman if these instead of being fulling hammers
had been some perilous adventure have i not think you shown the
courage required for the attempt and achievement am i perchance being
as i am a gentleman bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell
whether they come from fulling mills or not and that when perhaps as
is the case i have never in my life seen any as you have low boor as
you are that have been born and bred among them but turn me these six
hammers into six giants and bring them to beard me one by one or all
together and if i do not knock them head over heels then make what
no more of that senor returned sancho i own i went a little too far
with the joke but tell me your worship now that peace is made between
us and may god bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you
as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one was it not a
thing to laugh at and is it not a good story the great fear we were
in at least that i was in for as to your worship i see now that you
neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is
i do not deny said don quixote that what happened to us may be worth
laughing at but it is not worth making a story about for it is not
everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing
at any rate said sancho your worship knew how to hit the right point
with your pike aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders thanks
be to god and my own smartness in dodging it but let that pass all will
come out in the scouring for i have heard say he loves thee well that
makes thee weep and moreover that it is the way with great lords after
any hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches though
i do not know what they give after blows unless it be that
knights errant after blows give islands or kingdoms on the mainland
it may be on the dice said don quixote that all thou sayest will
come true overlook the past for thou art shrewd enough to know that our
first movements are not in our own control and one thing for the future
bear in mind that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company
for in all the books of chivalry that i have read and they are
innumerable i never met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as
thou dost to thine and in fact i feel it to be a great fault of thine
and of mine of thine that thou hast so little respect for me of mine
that i do not make myself more respected there was gandalin the squire
of amadis of gaul that was count of the insula firme and we read of him
that he always addressed his lord with his cap in his hand his head
bowed down and his body bent double more turquesco and then what shall
we say of gasabal the squire of galaor who was so silent that in order
to indicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is
only once mentioned in the whole of that history as long as it is
truthful from all i have said thou wilt gather sancho that there must
be a difference between master and man between lord and lackey between
knight and squire so that from this day forward in our intercourse we
must observe more respect and take less liberties for in whatever way i
may be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher the favours and
benefits that i have promised you will come in due time and if they do
not your wages at least will not be lost as i have already told you
all that your worship says is very well said sancho but i should
like to know in case the time of favours should not come and it might
be necessary to fall back upon wages how much did the squire of a
knight errant get in those days and did they agree by the month or by
i do not believe replied don quixote that such squires were ever on
wages but were dependent on favour and if i have now mentioned thine in
the sealed will i have left at home it was with a view to what may
happen for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn out in these
wretched times of ours and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles
in the other world for i would have thee know sancho that in this
there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers
that is true said sancho since the mere noise of the hammers of a
fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant
adventurer as your worship but you may be sure i will not open my lips
henceforward to make light of anything of your worships but only to
honour you as my master and natural lord
by so doing replied don quixote shalt thou live long on the face of
the earth for next to parents masters are to be respected as though
which treats of the exalted adventure and rich prize of mambrinos
helmet together with other things that happened to our invincible knight
it now began to rain a little and sancho was for going into the fulling
mills but don quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of
the late joke that he would not enter them on any account so turning
aside to right they came upon another road different from that which
they had taken the night before shortly afterwards don quixote perceived
a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold
and the moment he saw him he turned to sancho and said
i think sancho there is no proverb that is not true all being maxims
drawn from experience itself the mother of all the sciences especially
that one that says where one door shuts another opens i say so
because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were
looking for against us cheating us with the fulling mills it now opens
wide another one for another better and more certain adventure and if i
do not contrive to enter it it will be my own fault and i cannot lay it
to my ignorance of fulling mills or the darkness of the night i say
this because if i mistake not there comes towards us one who wears on
his head the helmet of mambrino concerning which i took the oath thou
mind what you say your worship and still more what you do said
sancho for i dont want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling
the devil take thee man said don quixote what has a helmet to do
i dont know replied sancho but faith if i might speak as i used
perhaps i could give such reasons that your worship would see you were
how can i be mistaken in what i say unbelieving traitor returned don
quixote tell me seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a
dappled grey steed who has upon his head a helmet of gold
what i see and make out answered sancho is only a man on a grey ass
like my own who has something that shines on his head
well that is the helmet of mambrino said don quixote stand to one
side and leave me alone with him thou shalt see how without saying a
word to save time i shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess
myself of the helmet i have so longed for
i will take care to stand aside said sancho but god grant i say
once more that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills
i have told thee brother on no account to mention those fulling mills
to me again said don quixote or i vow and i say no more ill full
sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow
he had hurled like a bowl at him
the fact of the matter as regards the helmet steed and knight that don
quixote saw was this in that neighbourhood there were two villages one
of them so small that it had neither apothecarys shop nor barber which
the other that was close to it had so the barber of the larger served
the smaller and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and
another man who wanted to be shaved and on this errand the barber was
going carrying with him a brass basin but as luck would have it as he
was on the way it began to rain and not to spoil his hat which probably
was a new one he put the basin on his head and being clean it glittered
at half a leagues distance he rode upon a grey ass as sancho said and
this was what made it seem to don quixote to be a dapple grey steed and a
knight and a golden helmet for everything he saw he made to fall in with
his crazy chivalry and ill errant notions and when he saw the poor
knight draw near without entering into any parley with him at
rocinantes top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low
fully determined to run him through and through and as he reached him
without checking the fury of his charge he cried to him
defend thyself miserable being or yield me of thine own accord that
the barber who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this
apparition coming down upon him had no other way of saving himself from
the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass and no
sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a
deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind
he left the basin on the ground with which don quixote contented
himself saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the
beaver which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off
with its teeth that for which by its natural instinct it knows it is
he told sancho to pick up the helmet and he taking it in his hands said
by god the basin is a good one and worth a real of eight if it is worth
a maravedis and handed it to his master who immediately put it on his
head turning it round now this way now that in search of fitment and
not finding it he said clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous
head piece was first forged must have had a very large head but the
worst of it is half of it is wanting
when sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to
restrain his laughter but remembering his masters wrath he checked
what art thou laughing at sancho said don quixote
i am laughing said he to think of the great head the pagan must have
had who owned this helmet for it looks exactly like a regular barbers
dost thou know what i suspect sancho said don quixote that this
wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident
have come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or
realise its value and who not knowing what he did and seeing it to be
of the purest gold must have melted down one half for the sake of what
it might be worth and of the other made this which is like a barbers
basin as thou sayest but be it as it may to me who recognise it its
transformation makes no difference for i will set it to rights at the
first village where there is a blacksmith and in such style that that
helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not
surpass it or even come up to it and in the meantime i will wear it as
well as i can for something is better than nothing all the more as it
will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone
that is said sancho if it is not shot with a sling as they were in
the battle of the two armies when they signed the cross on your
worships grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that
it does not grieve me much to have lost it said don quixote for thou
knowest sancho that i have the receipt in my memory
so have i answered sancho but if ever i make it or try it again as
long as i live may this be my last hour moreover i have no intention
of putting myself in the way of wanting it for i mean with all my five
senses to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone as to
being blanketed again i say nothing for it is hard to prevent mishaps of
that sort and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our
shoulders together hold our breath shut our eyes and let ourselves go
where luck and the blanket may send us
thou art a bad christian sancho said don quixote on hearing this
for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it but know
that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance
to trifles what lame leg hast thou got by it what broken rib what
cracked head that thou canst not forget that jest for jest and sport it
was properly regarded and had i not seen it in that light i would have
returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the greeks did for
the rape of helen who if she were alive now or if my dulcinea had
lived then might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her
beauty as she is and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft and said
sancho let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest but
i know what sort of jest and earnest it was and i know it will never be
rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders but putting that
aside will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple grey
steed that looks like a grey ass which that martino that your worship
overthrew has left deserted here for from the way he took to his heels
and bolted he is not likely ever to come back for it and by my beard
i have never been in the habit said don quixote of taking spoil of
those whom i vanquish nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away
their horses and leave them to go on foot unless indeed it be that the
victor have lost his own in the combat in which case it is lawful to
take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war therefore
sancho leave this horse or ass or whatever thou wilt have it to be
for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it
god knows i should like to take it returned sancho or at least to
change it for my own which does not seem to me as good a one verily the
laws of chivalry are strict since they cannot be stretched to let one
ass be changed for another i should like to know if i might at least
on that head i am not quite certain answered don quixote and the
matter being doubtful pending better information i say thou mayest
change them if so be thou hast urgent need of them
so urgent is it answered sancho that if they were for my own person
i could not want them more and forthwith fortified by this licence he
effected the mutatio capparum rigging out his beast to the ninety nines
and making quite another thing of it this done they broke their fast on
the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule and
drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills without casting a
look in that direction in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm
they had caused them and all anger and gloom removed they mounted and
without taking any fixed road not to fix upon any being the proper thing
for true knights errant they set out guided by rocinantes will which
carried along with it that of his master not to say that of the ass
which always followed him wherever he led lovingly and sociably
nevertheless they returned to the high road and pursued it at a venture
as they went along then in this way sancho said to his master senor
would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you for since you
laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to
rot in my stomach and i have now just one on the tip of my tongue that i
say on sancho said don quixote and be brief in thy discourse for
there is no pleasure in one that is long
well then senor returned sancho i say that for some days past i
have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of
these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross roads
where even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved there is no
one to see or know of them and so they must be left untold for ever to
the loss of your worships object and the credit they deserve therefore
it seems to me it would be better saving your worships better judgment
if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may
have some war on hand in whose service your worship may prove the worth
of your person your great might and greater understanding on
perceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have
to reward us each according to his merits and there you will not be at
a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to
preserve their memory for ever of my own i say nothing as they will not
go beyond squirely limits though i make bold to say that if it be the
practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires i think mine
thou speakest not amiss sancho answered don quixote but before that
point is reached it is requisite to roam the world as it were on
probation seeking adventures in order that by achieving some name and
fame may be acquired such that when he betakes himself to the court of
some great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds and that
the boys the instant they see him enter the gate of the city may all
follow him and surround him crying this is the knight of the sun or
the serpent or any other title under which he may have achieved great
deeds this they will say is he who vanquished in single combat the
gigantic brocabruno of mighty strength he who delivered the great
mameluke of persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been
for almost nine hundred years so from one to another they will go
proclaiming his achievements and presently at the tumult of the boys and
the others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his
royal palace and as soon as he beholds the knight recognising him by
his arms and the device on his shield he will as a matter of course say
what ho forth all ye the knights of my court to receive the flower of
chivalry who cometh hither at which command all will issue forth and
he himself advancing half way down the stairs will embrace him closely
and salute him kissing him on the cheek and will then lead him to the
queens chamber where the knight will find her with the princess her
daughter who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels
that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known
world straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon
the knight and he his upon her and each will seem to the other something
more divine than human and without knowing how or why they will be
taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love and sorely
distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and
sufferings known by speech thence they will lead him no doubt to some
richly adorned chamber of the palace where having removed his armour
they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself
and if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a
doublet when night comes he will sup with the king queen and princess
and all the time he will never take his eyes off her stealing stealthy
glances unnoticed by those present and she will do the same and with
equal cautiousness being as i have said a damsel of great discretion
the tables being removed suddenly through the door of the hall there
will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame
between two giants who comes with a certain adventure the work of an
ancient sage and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight
the king will then command all those present to essay it and none will
bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight to the great
enhancement of his fame whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will
esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her
thoughts so high and the best of it is that this king or prince or
whatever he is is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful
as himself and the stranger knight after having been some days at his
court requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war the
king will grant it very readily and the knight will courteously kiss his
hands for the favour done to him and that night he will take leave of
his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps
which looks upon a garden and at which he has already many times
conversed with her the go between and confidante in the matter being a
damsel much trusted by the princess he will sigh she will swoon the
damsel will fetch water much distressed because morning approaches and
for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered at
last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands
through the grating to the knight who will kiss them a thousand and a
thousand times bathing them with his tears it will be arranged between
them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes
and the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as
possible which he will promise to do with many oaths once more he
kisses her hands and takes his leave in such grief that he is well nigh
ready to die he betakes him thence to his chamber flings himself on his
bed cannot sleep for sorrow at parting rises early in the morning goes
to take leave of the king queen and princess and as he takes his
leave of the pair it is told him that the princess is indisposed and
cannot receive a visit the knight thinks it is from grief at his
departure his heart is pierced and he is hardly able to keep from
showing his pain the confidante is present observes all goes to tell
her mistress who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest
distresses is not knowing who this knight is and whether he is of kingly
lineage or not the damsel assures her that so much courtesy gentleness
and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any
save one who was royal and illustrious her anxiety is thus relieved and
she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her
parents and at the end of two days she appears in public meanwhile the
knight has taken his departure he fights in the war conquers the kings
enemy wins many cities triumphs in many battles returns to the court
sees his lady where he was wont to see her and it is agreed that he
shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his
services the king is unwilling to give her as he knows not who he is
but nevertheless whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be
the princess comes to be his bride and her father comes to regard it as
very good fortune for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the
son of a valiant king of some kingdom i know not what for i fancy it is
not likely to be on the map the father dies the princess inherits and
in two words the knight becomes king and here comes in at once the
bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising
to so exalted a rank he marries his squire to a damsel of the
princesss who will be no doubt the one who was confidante in their
amour and is daughter of a very great duke
thats what i want and no mistake about it said sancho thats what
im waiting for for all this word for word is in store for your
worship under the title of the knight of the rueful countenance
thou needst not doubt it sancho replied don quixote for in the same
manner and by the same steps as i have described here knights errant
rise and have risen to be kings and emperors all we want now is to find
out what king christian or pagan is at war and has a beautiful
daughter but there will be time enough to think of that for as i have
told thee fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the
court there is another thing too that is wanting for supposing we
find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter and that i have
won incredible fame throughout the universe i know not how it can be
made out that i am of royal lineage or even second cousin to an emperor
for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage
unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point however much my
famous deeds may deserve it so that by this deficiency i fear i shall
lose what my arm has fairly earned true it is i am a gentleman of known
house of estate and property and entitled to the five hundred sueldos
mulct and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so
clear up my ancestry and pedigree that i may find myself fifth or sixth
in descent from a king for i would have thee know sancho that there
are two kinds of lineages in the world some there be tracing and
deriving their descent from kings and princes whom time has reduced
little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down
and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step
until they come to be great lords so that the difference is that the one
were what they no longer are and the others are what they formerly were
not and i may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove
great and famous with which the king my father in law that is to be
ought to be satisfied and should he not be the princess will so love me
that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water carrier she
will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father if not
then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where i please for
time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents
it comes to this too said sancho what some naughty people say
never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force though it would
fit better to say a clear escape is better than good mens prayers i
say so because if my lord the king your worships father in law will
not condescend to give you my lady the princess there is nothing for it
but as your worship says to seize her and transport her but the
mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful
enjoyment of your kingdom the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards
go unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes
with the princess and that with her he tides over his bad luck until
heaven otherwise orders things for his master i suppose may as well
give her to him at once for a lawful wife
nobody can object to that said don quixote
then since that may be said sancho there is nothing for it but to
commend ourselves to god and let fortune take what course it will
god guide it according to my wishes and thy wants said don quixote
and mean be he who thinks himself mean
in gods name let him be so said sancho i am an old christian and
to fit me for a count thats enough
and more than enough for thee said don quixote and even wert thou
not it would make no difference because i being the king can easily
give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee for when
i make thee a count then thou art at once a gentleman and they may say
what they will but by my faith they will have to call thee your
not a doubt of it and ill know how to support the tittle said
title thou shouldst say not tittle said his master
so be it answered sancho i say i will know how to behave for once
in my life i was beadle of a brotherhood and the beadles gown sat so
well on me that all said i looked as if i was to be steward of the same
brotherhood what will it be then when i put a dukes robe on my back
or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count i believe theyll come a
thou wilt look well said don quixote but thou must shave thy beard
often for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt that if thou dost
not shave it every second day at least they will see what thou art at
what more will it be said sancho than having a barber and keeping
him at wages in the house and even if it be necessary i will make him
why how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them asked
i will tell you answered sancho years ago i was for a month at the
capital and there i saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they
said was a very great man and a man following him on horseback in every
turn he took just as if he was his tail i asked why this man did not
join the other man instead of always going behind him they answered me
that he was his equerry and that it was the custom with nobles to have
such persons behind them and ever since then i know it for i have never
thou art right said don quixote and in the same way thou mayest
carry thy barber with thee for customs did not come into use all
together nor were they all invented at once and thou mayest be the
first count to have a barber to follow him and indeed shaving ones
beard is a greater trust than saddling ones horse
let the barber business be my look out said sancho and your
