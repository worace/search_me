i pity you beauteous lady that you should have directed your thoughts
of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can
be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth for which
you must not blame this unhappy knight errant whom love renders incapable
of submission to any other than her whom the first moment his eyes
beheld her he made absolute mistress of his soul forgive me noble
lady and retire to your apartment and do not by any further
declaration of your passion compel me to show myself more ungrateful
and if of the love you bear me you should find that there is anything
else in my power wherein i can gratify you provided it be not love
itself demand it of me for i swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of
mine to grant it this instant though it be that you require of me a lock
of medusas hair which was all snakes or even the very beams of the sun
my mistress wants nothing of that sort sir knight said maritornes at
what then discreet dame is it that your mistress wants replied don
only one of your fair hands said maritornes to enable her to vent
over it the great passion passion which has brought her to this loophole
so much to the risk of her honour for if the lord her father had heard
her the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear
i should like to see that tried said don quixote but he had better
beware of that if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that
ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of
maritornes felt sure that don quixote would present the hand she had
asked and making up her mind what to do she got down from the hole and
went into the stable where she took the halter of sancho panzas ass
and in all haste returned to the hole just as don quixote had planted
himself standing on rocinantes saddle in order to reach the grated
window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be and giving her his
hand he said lady take this hand or rather this scourge of the
evil doers of the earth take i say this hand which no other hand of
woman has ever touched not even hers who has complete possession of my
entire body i present it to you not that you may kiss it but that you
may observe the contexture of the sinews the close network of the
muscles the breadth and capacity of the veins whence you may infer what
must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand
that we shall see presently said maritornes and making a running knot
on the halter she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole
tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw loft
don quixote feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist exclaimed
your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand treat it
not so harshly for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has
given you nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part
remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
but there was nobody now to listen to these words of don quixotes for
as soon as maritornes had tied him she and the other made off ready to
die with laughing leaving him fastened in such a way that it was
he was as has been said standing on rocinante with his arm passed
through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door and in
mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if rocinante were
to stir one side or the other so he did not dare to make the least
movement although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of
rocinante he had good reason to expect that he would stand without
budging for a whole century finding himself fast then and that the
ladies had retired he began to fancy that all this was done by
enchantment as on the former occasion when in that same castle that
enchanted moor of a carrier had belaboured him and he cursed in his
heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle
again after having come off so badly the first time it being a settled
point with knights errant that when they have tried an adventure and
have not succeeded in it it is a sign that it is not reserved for them
but for others and that therefore they need not try it again
nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself but it
had been made so fast that all his efforts were in vain it is true he
pulled it gently lest rocinante should move but try as he might to seat
himself in the saddle he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull
his hand off then it was he wished for the sword of amadis against
which no enchantment whatever had any power then he cursed his ill
fortune then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his
absence while he remained there enchanted for that he believed he was
beyond all doubt then he once more took to thinking of his beloved
dulcinea del toboso then he called to his worthy squire sancho panza
who buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack saddle of his ass was
oblivious at that moment of the mother that bore him then he called
upon the sages lirgandeo and alquife to come to his aid then he invoked
his good friend urganda to succour him and then at last morning found
him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing
like a bull for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his
suffering which he believed would last for ever inasmuch as he was
enchanted and of this he was convinced by seeing that rocinante never
stirred much or little and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were
to remain in this state without eating or drinking or sleeping until
the malign influence of the stars was overpast or until some other more
but he was very much deceived in this conclusion for daylight had hardly
begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback well
equipped and accoutred with firelocks across their saddle bows they
called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn which was still
shut on seeing which don quixote even there where he was did not
forget to act as sentinel and said in a loud and imperious tone
knights or squires or whatever ye be ye have no right to knock at the
gates of this castle for it is plain enough that they who are within are
either asleep or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress
until the suns rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth
withdraw to a distance and wait till it is broad daylight and then we
shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you
what the devil fortress or castle is this said one to make us stand
on such ceremony if you are the innkeeper bid them open to us we are
travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on for we are in
do you think gentlemen that i look like an innkeeper said don
i dont know what you look like replied the other but i know that
you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle
a castle it is returned don quixote nay more one of the best in
this whole province and it has within it people who have had the sceptre
in the hand and the crown on the head
it would be better if it were the other way said the traveller the
sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand but if so may be there is
within some company of players with whom it is a common thing to have
those crowns and sceptres you speak of for in such a small inn as this
and where such silence is kept i do not believe any people entitled to
crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters
you know but little of the world returned don quixote since you are
ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight errantry
but the comrades of the spokesman growing weary of the dialogue with don
quixote renewed their knocks with great vehemence so much so that the
host and not only he but everybody in the inn awoke and he got up to
ask who knocked it happened at this moment that one of the horses of the
four who were seeking admittance went to smell rocinante who melancholy
dejected and with drooping ears stood motionless supporting his sorely
stretched master and as he was after all flesh though he looked as if
he were made of wood he could not help giving way and in return smelling
the one who had come to offer him attentions but he had hardly moved at
all when don quixote lost his footing and slipping off the saddle he
would have come to the ground but for being suspended by the arm which
caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut
through or his arm torn off and he hung so near the ground that he could
just touch it with his feet which was all the worse for him for
finding how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly he
struggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing
just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado when they are
fixed at touch and no touch who aggravate their own sufferings by
their violent efforts to stretch themselves deceived by the hope which
makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground
in which are continued the unheard of adventures of the inn
so loud in fact were the shouts of don quixote that the landlord
opening the gate of the inn in all haste came out in dismay and ran to
see who was uttering such cries and those who were outside joined him
maritornes who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry
suspecting what it was ran to the loft and without anyone seeing her
untied the halter by which don quixote was suspended and down he came to
the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers who
approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so he
without replying a word took the rope off his wrist and rising to his
feet leaped upon rocinante braced his buckler on his arm put his lance
in rest and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a
whoever shall say that i have been enchanted with just cause provided
my lady the princess micomicona grants me permission to do so i give him
the lie challenge him and defy him to single combat
the newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of don quixote but
the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was and not
to mind him as he was out of his senses they then asked the landlord if
by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn
one dressed like a muleteer and of such and such an appearance
describing that of dona claras lover the landlord replied that there
were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were
inquiring for but one of them observing the coach in which the judge had
come said he is here no doubt for this is the coach he is following
let one of us stay at the gate and the rest go in to look for him or
indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn lest he
should escape over the wall of the yard so be it said another and
while two of them went in one remained at the gate and the other made
the circuit of the inn observing all which the landlord was unable to
conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions though
he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had
it was by this time broad daylight and for that reason as well as in
consequence of the noise don quixote had made everybody was awake and
up but particularly dona clara and dorothea for they had been able to
sleep but badly that night the one from agitation at having her lover so
near her the other from curiosity to see him don quixote when he saw
that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to
his challenge was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath
and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was
lawful for a knight errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise
when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any
until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged he would
have attacked the whole of them and would have made them return an
answer in spite of themselves but considering that it would not become
him nor be right to begin any new emprise until he had established
micomicona in her kingdom he was constrained to hold his peace and wait
quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same
travellers one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by
the side of a muleteer without a thought of anyone coming in search of
the man laid hold of him by the arm saying it becomes you well indeed
senor don luis to be in the dress you wear and well the bed in which i
find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you
the youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held
him but presently recognised him as one of his fathers servants at
which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter
a word while the servant went on to say there is nothing for it now
senor don luis but to submit quietly and return home unless it is your
wish that my lord your father should take his departure for the other
world for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at
but how did my father know that i had gone this road and in this dress
it was a student to whom you confided your intentions answered the
servant that disclosed them touched with pity at the distress he saw
your father suffer on missing you he therefore despatched four of his
servants in quest of you and here we all are at your service better
pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to
restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you
that shall be as i please or as heaven orders returned don luis
what can you please or heaven order said the other except to agree
all this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at
whose side don luis lay and rising he went to report what had taken
place to don fernando cardenio and the others who had by this time
dressed themselves and told them how the man had addressed the youth as
don and what words had passed and how he wanted him to return to his
father which the youth was unwilling to do with this and what they
already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him they
all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was and even to
help him if it was attempted to employ force against him so they
hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant
dorothea at this instant came out of her room followed by dona clara all
in a tremor and calling cardenio aside she told him in a few words the
story of the musician and dona clara and he at the same time told her
what had happened how his fathers servants had come in search of him
but in telling her so he did not speak low enough but that dona clara
heard what he said at which she was so much agitated that had not
dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground
cardenio then bade dorothea return to her room as he would endeavour to
make the whole matter right and they did as he desired all the four who
had come in quest of don luis had now come into the inn and surrounded
him urging him to return and console his father at once and without a
moments delay he replied that he could not do so on any account until
he had concluded some business in which his life honour and heart were
at stake the servants pressed him saying that most certainly they would
not return without him and that they would take him away whether he
you shall not do that replied don luis unless you take me dead
though however you take me it will be without life
by this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute
but particularly cardenio don fernando his companions the judge the
curate the barber and don quixote for he now considered there was no
necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer cardenio being
already acquainted with the young mans story asked the men who wanted
to take him away what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth
our object said one of the four is to save the life of his father
who is in danger of losing it through this gentlemans disappearance
upon this don luis exclaimed there is no need to make my affairs public
here i am free and i will return if i please and if not none of you
reason will compel your worship said the man and if it has no power
over you it has power over us to make us do what we came for and what
let us hear what the whole affair is about said the judge at this but
the man who knew him as a neighbour of theirs replied do you not know
this gentleman senor judge he is the son of your neighbour who has run
away from his fathers house in a dress so unbecoming his rank as your
the judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him and
embracing him said what folly is this senor don luis or what can have
been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way and
in this dress which so ill becomes your condition
tears came into the eyes of the young man and he was unable to utter a
word in reply to the judge who told the four servants not to be uneasy
for all would be satisfactorily settled and then taking don luis by the
hand he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there
but while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of
the inn the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the
night there seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four
men wanted had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they
owed but the landlord who minded his own affairs more than other
peoples caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning
abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them
to reply with their fists and so they began to lay on him in such a
style that the poor man was forced to cry out and call for help the
landlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than don
quixote and to him the daughter said sir knight by the virtue god has
given you help my poor father for two wicked men are beating him to a
to which don quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied fair
damsel at the present moment your request is inopportune for i am
debarred from involving myself in any adventure until i have brought to a
happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me but that which i
can do for you is what i will now mention run and tell your father to
stand his ground as well as he can in this battle and on no account to
allow himself to be vanquished while i go and request permission of the
princess micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress and if
she grants it rest assured i will relieve him from it
sinner that i am exclaimed maritornes who stood by before you have
got your permission my master will be in the other world
give me leave senora to obtain the permission i speak of returned
don quixote and if i get it it will matter very little if he is in the
other world for i will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world
can do or at any rate i will give you such a revenge over those who
shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately
satisfied and without saying anything more he went and knelt before
dorothea requesting her highness in knightly and errant phrase to be
pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that
castle who now stood in grievous jeopardy the princess granted it
graciously and he at once bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing
his sword hastened to the inn gate where the two guests were still
handling the landlord roughly but as soon as he reached the spot he
stopped short and stood still though maritornes and the landlady asked
him why he hesitated to help their master and husband
i hesitate said don quixote because it is not lawful for me to draw
sword against persons of squirely condition but call my squire sancho to
me for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business
thus matters stood at the inn gate where there was a very lively
exchange of fisticuffs and punches to the sore damage of the landlord
and to the wrath of maritornes the landlady and her daughter who were
furious when they saw the pusillanimity of don quixote and the hard
treatment their master husband and father was undergoing but let us
leave him there for he will surely find some one to help him and if
not let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his
strength allows him to do and let us go back fifty paces to see what don
luis said in reply to the judge whom we left questioning him privately as
to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed
to which the youth pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was
troubled by some great sorrow and shedding a flood of tears made
senor i have no more to tell you than that from the moment when
through heavens will and our being near neighbours i first saw dona
clara your daughter and my lady from that instant i made her the
mistress of my will and if yours my true lord and father offers no
impediment this very day she shall become my wife for her i left my
fathers house and for her i assumed this disguise to follow her
whithersoever she may go as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the
pole star she knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have
learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were
filled with tears you know already senor the wealth and noble birth of
my parents and that i am their sole heir if this be a sufficient
inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy accept me at
once as your son for if my father influenced by other objects of his
own should disapprove of this happiness i have sought for myself time
has more power to alter and change things than human will
with this the love smitten youth was silent while the judge after
hearing him was astonished perplexed and surprised as well at the
manner and intelligence with which don luis had confessed the secret of
his heart as at the position in which he found himself not knowing what
course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected all the answer
therefore he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for the
present and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day so
that there might be time to consider what was best for all parties don
luis kissed his hands by force nay bathed them with his tears in a way
that would have touched a heart of marble not to say that of the judge
who as a shrewd man had already perceived how advantageous the marriage
would be to his daughter though were it possible he would have
preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father
of don luis who he knew looked for a title for his son
the guests had by this time made peace with the landlord for by
persuasion and don quixotes fair words more than by threats they had
paid him what he demanded and the servants of don luis were waiting for
the end of the conversation with the judge and their masters decision
when the devil who never sleeps contrived that the barber from whom
don quixote had taken mambrinos helmet and sancho panza the trappings
of his ass in exchange for those of his own should at this instant enter
the inn which said barber as he led his ass to the stable observed
sancho panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the
pack saddle and the moment he saw it he knew it and made bold to attack
sancho exclaiming ho sir thief i have caught you hand over my basin
and my pack saddle and all my trappings that you robbed me of
sancho finding himself so unexpectedly assailed and hearing the abuse
poured upon him seized the pack saddle with one hand and with the other
gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood the barber
however was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the
pack saddle on the contrary he raised such an outcry that everyone in
the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant here in
the name of the king and justice he cried this thief and highwayman
wants to kill me for trying to recover my property
you lie said sancho i am no highwayman it was in fair war my master
don quixote was standing by at the time highly pleased to see his
squires stoutness both offensive and defensive and from that time
forth he reckoned him a man of mettle and in his heart resolved to dub
him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself feeling sure
that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him
in the course of the altercation among other things the barber said
gentlemen this pack saddle is mine as surely as i owe god a death and
i know it as well as if i had given birth to it and here is my ass in
the stable who will not let me lie only try it and if it does not fit
him like a glove call me a rascal and what is more the same day i was
robbed of this they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin never yet
handselled that would fetch a crown any day
at this don quixote could not keep himself from answering and
interposing between the two and separating them he placed the
pack saddle on the ground to lie there in sight until the truth was
established and said your worships may perceive clearly and plainly
the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which
was is and shall be the helmet of mambrino which i won from him in air
war and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession with
the pack saddle i do not concern myself but i may tell you on that head
that my squire sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of
this vanquished poltroons steed and with it adorn his own i allowed
him and he took it and as to its having been changed from a caparison
into a pack saddle i can give no explanation except the usual one that
such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry to
confirm all which run sancho my son and fetch hither the helmet which
egad master said sancho if we have no other proof of our case than
what your worship puts forward mambrinos helmet is just as much a basin
as this good fellows caparison is a pack saddle
do as i bid thee said don quixote it cannot be that everything in
sancho hastened to where the basin was and brought it back with him and
when don quixote saw it he took hold of it and said
your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this
is a basin and not the helmet i told you of and i swear by the order of
chivalry i profess that this helmet is the identical one i took from
him without anything added to or taken from it
there is no doubt of that said sancho for from the time my master
won it until now he has only fought one battle in it when he let loose
those unlucky men in chains and if had not been for this basin helmet he
would not have come off over well that time for there was plenty of
in which the doubtful question of mambrinos helmet and the pack saddle
is finally settled with other adventures that occurred in truth and
what do you think now gentlemen said the barber of what these
gentles say when they want to make out that this is a helmet
and whoever says the contrary said don quixote i will let him know
he lies if he is a knight and if he is a squire that he lies again a
our own barber who was present at all this and understood don quixotes
humour so thoroughly took it into his head to back up his delusion and
carry on the joke for the general amusement so addressing the other
senor barber or whatever you are you must know that i belong to your
profession too and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty
years and i know the implements of the barber craft every one of them
perfectly well and i was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of
my youth and i know also what a helmet is and a morion and a headpiece
with a visor and other things pertaining to soldiering i meant to say
to soldiers arms and i say saving better opinions and always with
submission to sounder judgments that this piece we have now before us
which this worthy gentleman has in his hands not only is no barbers
basin but is as far from being one as white is from black and truth
from falsehood i say moreover that this although it is a helmet is
certainly not said don quixote for half of it is wanting that is to
it is quite true said the curate who saw the object of his friend the
barber and cardenio don fernando and his companions agreed with him
and even the judge if his thoughts had not been so full of don luiss
affair would have helped to carry on the joke but he was so taken up
with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no
god bless me exclaimed their butt the barber at this is it possible
that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a
helmet why this is a thing that would astonish a whole university
however wise it might be that will do if this basin is a helmet why
then the pack saddle must be a horses caparison as this gentleman has
to me it looks like a pack saddle said don quixote but i have
already said that with that question i do not concern myself
as to whether it be pack saddle or caparison said the curate it is
only for senor don quixote to say for in these matters of chivalry all
these gentlemen and i bow to his authority
by god gentlemen said don quixote so many strange things have
happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which i have
sojourned in it that i will not venture to assert anything positively in
reply to any question touching anything it contains for it is my belief
that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment the first
time an enchanted moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble nor did
sancho fare well among certain followers of his and last night i was
kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours without knowing how or why
i came by such a mishap so that now for me to come forward to give an
opinion in such a puzzling matter would be to risk a rash decision as
regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet i have
already given an answer but as to the question whether this is a
pack saddle or a caparison i will not venture to give a positive opinion
but will leave it to your worships better judgment perhaps as you are
not dubbed knights like myself the enchantments of this place have
nothing to do with you and your faculties are unfettered and you can
see things in this castle as they really and truly are and not as they
there can be no question said don fernando on this but that senor
don quixote has spoken very wisely and that with us rests the decision
of this matter and that we may have surer ground to go on i will take
the votes of the gentlemen in secret and declare the result clearly and
to those who were in the secret of don quixotes humour all this afforded
great amusement but to those who knew nothing about it it seemed the
greatest nonsense in the world in particular to the four servants of don
luis as well as to don luis himself and to three other travellers who
had by chance come to the inn and had the appearance of officers of the
holy brotherhood as indeed they were but the one who above all was at
his wits end was the barber basin there before his very eyes had been
turned into mambrinos helmet and whose pack saddle he had no doubt
whatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse all laughed to
see don fernando going from one to another collecting the votes and
whispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure
over which there had been so much fighting was a pack saddle or a
caparison but after he had taken the votes of those who knew don
quixote he said aloud the fact is my good fellow that i am tired
collecting such a number of opinions for i find that there is not one of
whom i ask what i desire to know who does not tell me that it is absurd
to say that this is the pack saddle of an ass and not the caparison of a
horse nay of a thoroughbred horse so you must submit for in spite of
you and your ass this is a caparison and no pack saddle and you have
may i never share heaven said the poor barber if your worships are
not all mistaken and may my soul appear before god as that appears to me
a pack saddle and not a caparison but laws go i say no more and
indeed i am not drunk for i am fasting except it be from sin
the simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the
there is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to
him and to whom god has given it may st peter add his blessing
but said one of the four servants unless indeed this is a deliberate
joke i cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those
present are or seem to be can venture to declare and assert that this
is not a basin and that not a pack saddle but as i perceive that they
do assert and declare it i can only come to the conclusion that there is
some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of
experience and truth itself for i swear by and here he rapped out a
round oath all the people in the world will not make me believe that
this is not a barbers basin and that a jackasss pack saddle
it might easily be a she asss observed the curate
it is all the same said the servant that is not the point but
whether it is or is not a pack saddle as your worships say
on hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the brotherhood who
had been listening to the dispute and controversy unable to restrain his
anger and impatience exclaimed it is a pack saddle as sure as my
father is my father and whoever has said or will say anything else must
you lie like a rascally clown returned don quixote and lifting his
pike which he had never let out of his hand he delivered such a blow at
his head that had not the officer dodged it it would have stretched him
at full length the pike was shivered in pieces against the ground and
the rest of the officers seeing their comrade assaulted raised a shout
calling for help for the holy brotherhood the landlord who was of the
fraternity ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword and
ranged himself on the side of his comrades the servants of don luis
clustered round him lest he should escape from them in the confusion
the barber seeing the house turned upside down once more laid hold of
his pack saddle and sancho did the same don quixote drew his sword and
charged the officers don luis cried out to his servants to leave him
alone and go and help don quixote and cardenio and don fernando who
were supporting him the curate was shouting at the top of his voice the
landlady was screaming her daughter was wailing maritornes was weeping
dorothea was aghast luscinda terror stricken and dona clara in a faint
the barber cudgelled sancho and sancho pommelled the barber don luis
gave one of his servants who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep
him from escaping a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood the judge took
his part don fernando had got one of the officers down and was
belabouring him heartily the landlord raised his voice again calling for
help for the holy brotherhood so that the whole inn was nothing but
cries shouts shrieks confusion terror dismay mishaps sword cuts
fisticuffs cudgellings kicks and bloodshed and in the midst of all
this chaos complication and general entanglement don quixote took it
into his head that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of
agramantes camp and in a voice that shook the inn like thunder he
hold all let all sheathe their swords let all be calm and attend to me
all paused at his mighty voice and he went on to say did i not tell
you sirs that this castle was enchanted and that a legion or so of
devils dwelt in it in proof whereof i call upon you to behold with your
own eyes how the discord of agramantes camp has come hither and been
transferred into the midst of us see how they fight there for the
sword here for the horse on that side for the eagle on this for the
helmet we are all fighting and all at cross purposes come then you
senor judge and you senor curate let the one represent king agramante
and the other king sobrino and make peace among us for by god almighty
it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should
slay one another for such trifling cause the officers who did not
understand don quixotes mode of speaking and found themselves roughly
handled by don fernando cardenio and their companions were not to be
appeased the barber was however for both his beard and his pack saddle
were the worse for the struggle sancho like a good servant obeyed the
slightest word of his master while the four servants of don luis kept
quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so the landlord
alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this
madman who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn but at length
the uproar was stilled for the present the pack saddle remained a
caparison till the day of judgment and the basin a helmet and the inn a
all having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the
judge and the curate the servants of don luis began again to urge him to
return with them at once and while he was discussing the matter with
them the judge took counsel with don fernando cardenio and the curate
as to what he ought to do in the case telling them how it stood and
what don luis had said to him it was agreed at length that don fernando
should tell the servants of don luis who he was and that it was his
desire that don luis should accompany him to andalusia where he would
receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him
to for otherwise it was easy to see from the determination of don luis
that he would not return to his father at present though they tore him
to pieces on learning the rank of don fernando and the resolution of don
luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them
should return to tell his father how matters stood and that the other
should remain to wait upon don luis and not leave him until they came
back for him or his fathers orders were known thus by the authority of
agramante and the wisdom of king sobrino all this complication of
disputes was arranged but the enemy of concord and hater of peace
feeling himself slighted and made a fool of and seeing how little he had
gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement
resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and
it came about in this wise the officers were pacified on learning the
rank of those with whom they had been engaged and withdrew from the
contest considering that whatever the result might be they were likely
to get the worst of the battle but one of them the one who had been
thrashed and kicked by don fernando recollected that among some warrants
he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents he had one against don
quixote whom the holy brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting
the galley slaves free as sancho had with very good reason
apprehended suspecting how it was then he wished to satisfy himself as
to whether don quixotes features corresponded and taking a parchment
out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of and setting
himself to read it deliberately for he was not a quick reader as he
made out each word he fixed his eyes on don quixote and went on
comparing the description in the warrant with his face and discovered
that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it as soon as he
had satisfied himself folding up the parchment he took the warrant in
his left hand and with his right seized don quixote by the collar so
tightly that he did not allow him to breathe and shouted aloud help
for the holy brotherhood and that you may see i demand it in earnest
read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested
the curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true
and that it agreed with don quixotes appearance who on his part when
he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown worked up to the
highest pitch of wrath and all his joints cracking with rage with both
hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might so that had he
not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere don
quixote released his hold the landlord who had perforce to support his
brother officers ran at once to aid them the landlady when she saw her
husband engaged in a fresh quarrel lifted up her voice afresh and its
note was immediately caught up by maritornes and her daughter calling
upon heaven and all present for help and sancho seeing what was going
on exclaimed by the lord it is quite true what my master says about
the enchantments of this castle for it is impossible to live an hour in
don fernando parted the officer and don quixote and to their mutual
contentment made them relax the grip by which they held the one the coat
collar the other the throat of his adversary for all this however the
officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help
and deliver him over bound into their power as was required for the
service of the king and of the holy brotherhood on whose behalf they
again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber
don quixote smiled when he heard these words and said very calmly come
now base ill born brood call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to
those in bondage to release the captives to succour the miserable to
raise up the fallen to relieve the needy infamous beings who by your
vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to
you the virtue that lies in knight errantry or show you the sin and
ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow not to
say the presence of any knight errant come now band not of officers
but of thieves footpads with the licence of the holy brotherhood tell
me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a
knight as i am who was he that did not know that knights errant are
independent of all jurisdictions that their law is their sword their
charter their prowess and their edicts their will who i say again was
the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that
confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight errant acquires the day
he is dubbed a knight and devotes himself to the arduous calling of
chivalry what knight errant ever paid poll tax duty queens pin money
kings dues toll or ferry what tailor ever took payment of him for
making his clothes what castellan that received him in his castle ever
made him pay his shot what king did not seat him at his table what
damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to
his will and pleasure and lastly what knight errant has there been is
there or will there ever be in the world not bold enough to give
single handed four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the
holy brotherhood if they come in his way
of the end of the notable adventure of the officers of the holy
brotherhood and of the great ferocity of our worthy knight don quixote
while don quixote was talking in this strain the curate was endeavouring
to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses as they might
perceive by his deeds and his words and that they need not press the
matter any further for even if they arrested him and carried him off
they would have to release him by and by as a madman to which the holder
of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into don
quixotes madness but only to execute his superiors orders and that
once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked
for all that said the curate you must not take him away this time
nor will he it is my opinion let himself be taken away
in short the curate used such arguments and don quixote did such mad
things that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they
had not perceived his want of wits and so they thought it best to allow
themselves to be pacified and even to act as peacemakers between the
barber and sancho panza who still continued their altercation with much
bitterness in the end they as officers of justice settled the question
by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were if not perfectly
contented at least to some extent satisfied for they changed the
pack saddles but not the girths or head stalls and as to mambrinos
helmet the curate under the rose and without don quixotes knowing it
paid eight reals for the basin and the barber executed a full receipt
and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for
evermore amen these two disputes which were the most important and
gravest being settled it only remained for the servants of don luis to
consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany
him whither don fernando desired to take him and good luck and better
fortune having already begun to solve difficulties and remove
obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn were
pleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue for the
servants agreed to do as don luis wished which gave dona clara such
happiness that no one could have looked into her face just then without
seeing the joy of her heart zoraida though she did not fully comprehend
all she saw was grave or gay without knowing why as she watched and
studied the various countenances but particularly her spaniards whom
she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul the gift and
compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the
landlords notice and he demanded don quixotes reckoning together with
the amount of the damage to his wine skins and the loss of his wine
swearing that neither rocinante nor sanchos ass should leave the inn
until he had been paid to the very last farthing the curate settled all
amicably and don fernando paid though the judge had also very readily
offered to pay the score and all became so peaceful and quiet that the
inn no longer reminded one of the discord of agramantes camp as don
quixote said but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of
octavianus for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks
were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate and to the
finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels his squires as well
as his own don quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue
the journey he had begun and bring to a close that great adventure for
which he had been called and chosen and with this high resolve he went
and knelt before dorothea who however would not allow him to utter a
word until he had risen so to obey her he rose and said it is a
common proverb fair lady that diligence is the mother of good
fortune and experience has often shown in important affairs that the
earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful
termination but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than
in war where quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy
and win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself all this i
say exalted and esteemed lady because it seems to me that for us to
remain any longer in this castle now is useless and may be injurious to
us in a way that we shall find out some day for who knows but that your
enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies
that i am going to destroy him and if the opportunity be given him he
may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold
against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may
avail but little therefore lady let us as i say forestall his
schemes by our activity and let us depart at once in quest of fair
fortune for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you
could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary
don quixote held his peace and said no more calmly awaiting the reply of
the beauteous princess who with commanding dignity and in a style
adapted to don quixotes own replied to him in these words i give you
thanks sir knight for the eagerness you like a good knight to whom it
is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy display to
afford me aid in my sore trouble and heaven grant that your wishes and
mine may be realised so that you may see that there are women in this
world capable of gratitude as to my departure let it be forthwith for
i have no will but yours dispose of me entirely in accordance with your
good pleasure for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her
person and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions must not
think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain
on then in gods name said don quixote for when a lady humbles
herself to me i will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and
placing her on the throne of her ancestors let us depart at once for
the common saying that in delay there is danger lends spurs to my
eagerness to take the road and as neither heaven has created nor hell
seen any that can daunt or intimidate me saddle rocinante sancho and
get ready thy ass and the queens palfrey and let us take leave of the
castellan and these gentlemen and go hence this very instant
sancho who was standing by all the time said shaking his head ah
master master there is more mischief in the village than one hears of
what mischief can there be in any village or in all the cities of the
world you booby that can hurt my reputation said don quixote
if your worship is angry replied sancho i will hold my tongue and
leave unsaid what as a good squire i am bound to say and what a good
say what thou wilt returned don quixote provided thy words be not
meant to work upon my fears for thou if thou fearest art behaving like
thyself but i like myself in not fearing
it is nothing of the sort as i am a sinner before god said sancho
but that i take it to be sure and certain that this lady who calls
herself queen of the great kingdom of micomicon is no more so than my
mother for if she was what she says she would not go rubbing noses
with one that is here every instant and behind every door
dorothea turned red at sanchos words for the truth was that her husband
don fernando had now and then when the others were not looking gathered
from her lips some of the reward his love had earned and sancho seeing
this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a
queen of a great kingdom she however being unable or not caring to
answer him allowed him to proceed and he continued this i say senor
because if after we have travelled roads and highways and passed bad
nights and worse days one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to
reap the fruit of our labours there is no need for me to be in a hurry
to saddle rocinante put the pad on the ass or get ready the palfrey
for it will be better for us to stay quiet and let every jade mind her
good god what was the indignation of don quixote when he heard the
audacious words of his squire so great was it that in a voice
inarticulate with rage with a stammering tongue and eyes that flashed
living fire he exclaimed rascally clown boorish insolent and
ignorant ill spoken foul mouthed impudent backbiter and slanderer
hast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these
illustrious ladies hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless
thoughts in thy muddled imagination begone from my presence thou born
monster storehouse of lies hoard of untruths garner of knaveries
inventor of scandals publisher of absurdities enemy of the respect due
to royal personages begone show thyself no more before me under pain of
my wrath and so saying he knitted his brows puffed out his cheeks
gazed around him and stamped on the ground violently with his right
foot showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart and at
his words and furious gestures sancho was so scared and terrified that he
would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed
him and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the
but the ready witted dorothea who by this time so well understood don
quixotes humour said to mollify his wrath be not irritated at the
absurdities your good squire has uttered sir knight of the rueful
countenance for perhaps he did not utter them without cause and from
his good sense and christian conscience it is not likely that he would
bear false witness against anyone we may therefore believe without any
hesitation that since as you say sir knight everything in this castle
goes and is brought about by means of enchantment sancho i say may
possibly have seen through this diabolical medium what he says he saw
so much to the detriment of my modesty
i swear by god omnipotent exclaimed don quixote at this your
highness has hit the point and that some vile illusion must have come
before this sinner of a sancho that made him see what it would have been
impossible to see by any other means than enchantments for i know well
enough from the poor fellows goodness and harmlessness that he is
true no doubt said don fernando for which reason senor don
quixote you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your
favour sicut erat in principio before illusions of this sort had taken
don quixote said he was ready to pardon him and the curate went for
sancho who came in very humbly and falling on his knees begged for the
hand of his master who having presented it to him and allowed him to
kiss it gave him his blessing and said now sancho my son thou wilt
be convinced of the truth of what i have many a time told thee that
everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment
so it is i believe said sancho except the affair of the blanket
which came to pass in reality by ordinary means
believe it not said don quixote for had it been so i would have
avenged thee that instant or even now but neither then nor now could i
nor have i seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong
they were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was and the
landlord gave them a minute account of sanchos flights at which they
laughed not a little and at which sancho would have been no less out of
countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all
enchantment for all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch
that he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth
without any deception whatever about it that he had been blanketed by
beings of flesh and blood and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms
the illustrious company had now been two days in the inn and as it
seemed to them time to depart they devised a plan so that without
giving dorothea and don fernando the trouble of going back with don
quixote to his village under pretence of restoring queen micomicona the
curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they proposed
and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home and in
pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who
happened to be passing that way to carry him after this fashion they
constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars large enough to hold don
quixote comfortably and then don fernando and his companions the
servants of don luis and the officers of the brotherhood together with
the landlord by the directions and advice of the curate covered their
faces and disguised themselves some in one way some in another so as
to appear to don quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in
the castle this done in profound silence they entered the room where he
was asleep taking his his rest after the past frays and advancing to
where he was sleeping tranquilly not dreaming of anything of the kind
happening they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot so
that when he awoke startled he was unable to move and could only
marvel and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him upon which he
at once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured
up before him and took it into his head that all these shapes were
phantoms of the enchanted castle and that he himself was unquestionably
enchanted as he could neither move nor help himself precisely what the
curate the concoctor of the scheme expected would happen of all that
were there sancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in
his own proper character and he though he was within very little of
