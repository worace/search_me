jean valjean did not move it seemed as though his feet were nailed to
this is becoming serious said cosette what have i done to you i
declare that i am perplexed you owe me reparation you will dine with
that is not true i will get m gillenormand to scold you grandfathers
are made to reprimand fathers come go upstairs with me to the
here cosette lost ground a little she ceased to command and passed to
but why and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to
you know madame that i am peculiar i have my freaks
madame    you know    more novelties what is the meaning of
jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he
you wished to be madame you are so
call me monsieur jean jean if you like
you are no longer my father i am no longer cosette monsieur jean
what does this mean why these are revolutions arent they what has
taken place come look me in the face and you wont live with us
and you wont have my chamber what have i done to you has anything
he smiled again with the same smile as before and added
since you are madame pontmercy i certainly can be monsieur jean
i dont understand anything about it all this is idiotic i shall ask
permission of my husband for you to be monsieur jean i hope that he
will not consent to it you cause me a great deal of pain one does
have freaks but one does not cause ones little cosette grief that is
wrong you have no right to be wicked you who are so good
she seized his hands with vivacity and raising them to her face with
an irresistible movement she pressed them against her neck beneath her
chin which is a gesture of profound tenderness
this is what i call being good being nice and coming and living
here there are birds here as there are in the rue plumet living with
us quitting that hole of a rue de lhomme arme not giving us riddles
to guess being like all the rest of the world dining with us
you no longer need a father you have a husband
i no longer need a father one really does not know what to say to
things like that which are not common sense
if toussaint were here resumed jean valjean like a person who is
driven to seek authorities and who clutches at every branch she would
be the first to agree that it is true that i have always had ways of my
own there is nothing new in this i always have loved my black corner
but it is cold here one cannot see distinctly it is abominable that
it is to wish to be monsieur jean i will not have you say you to me
just now as i was coming hither replied jean valjean i saw a piece
of furniture in the rue saint louis it was at a cabinet makers if i
were a pretty woman i would treat myself to that bit of furniture a
very neat toilet table in the reigning style what you call rosewood i
think it is inlaid the mirror is quite large there are drawers it is
and with supreme grace setting her teeth and drawing back her lips she
blew at jean valjean she was a grace copying a cat
i am furious she resumed ever since yesterday you have made me
rage all of you i am greatly vexed i dont understand you do not
defend me against marius marius will not uphold me against you i am
all alone i arrange a chamber prettily if i could have put the good
god there i would have done it my chamber is left on my hands my
lodger sends me into bankruptcy i order a nice little dinner of
nicolette we will have nothing to do with your dinner madame and my
father fauchelevent wants me to call him monsieur jean and to receive
him in a frightful old ugly cellar where the walls have beards and
where the crystal consists of empty bottles and the curtains are of
spiders webs you are singular i admit that is your style but people
who get married are granted a truce you ought not to have begun being
singular again instantly so you are going to be perfectly contented in
your abominable rue de lhomme arme i was very desperate indeed there
that i was what have you against me you cause me a great deal of
and becoming suddenly serious she gazed intently at jean valjean and
are you angry with me because i am happy
which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean cosette had
he remained for a moment without replying then with an inexpressible
her happiness was the object of my life now god may sign my dismissal
cosette thou art happy my day is over
ah you have said thou to me exclaimed cosette
jean valjean in bewilderment strained her wildly to his breast it
almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back
this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean
valjean he gently removed cosettes arms and took his hat
i leave you madame they are waiting for you
i have said thou to you tell your husband that this shall not happen
jean valjean quitted the room leaving cosette stupefied at this
on the following day at the same hour jean valjean came
cosette asked him no questions was no longer astonished no longer
exclaimed that she was cold no longer spoke of the drawing room she
avoided saying either father or monsieur jean she allowed herself
to be addressed as you she allowed herself to be called madame only
her joy had undergone a certain diminution she would have been sad if
it is probable that she had had with marius one of those conversations
in which the beloved man says what he pleases explains nothing and
satisfies the beloved woman the curiosity of lovers does not extend
the lower room had made a little toilet basque had suppressed the
all the days which followed brought jean valjean at the same hour he
came every day because he had not the strength to take marius words
otherwise than literally marius arranged matters so as to be absent at
the hours when jean valjean came the house grew accustomed to the novel
ways of m fauchelevent toussaint helped in this direction monsieur
has always been like that she repeated the grandfather issued this
decree hes an original and all was said moreover at the age of
ninety six no bond is any longer possible all is merely juxtaposition
a newcomer is in the way there is no longer any room all habits are
asked nothing better than to be relieved from that gentleman he
added nothing is more common than those originals they do all sorts
of queer things they have no reason the marquis de canaples was still
worse he bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret these are
no one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation and moreover who
could have guessed such a thing there are marshes of this description
in india the water seems extraordinary inexplicable rippling though
there is no wind and agitated where it should be calm one gazes at the
surface of these causeless ebullitions one does not perceive the hydra
many men have a secret monster in this same manner a dragon which gnaws
them a despair which inhabits their night such a man resembles
other men he goes and comes no one knows that he bears within him a
frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth which lives within the
unhappy man and of which he is dying no one knows that this man is a
gulf he is stagnant but deep from time to time a trouble of which
the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface a mysterious
wrinkle is formed then vanishes then re appears an air bubble rises
and bursts it is the breathing of the unknown beast
certain strange habits arriving at the hour when other people are
taking their leave keeping in the background when other people
are displaying themselves preserving on all occasions what may be
designated as the wall colored mantle seeking the solitary walk
preferring the deserted street avoiding any share in conversation
avoiding crowds and festivals seeming at ones ease and living poorly
having ones key in ones pocket and ones candle at the porters
lodge however rich one may be entering by the side door ascending
the private staircase all these insignificant singularities fugitive
folds on the surface often proceed from a formidable foundation
many weeks passed in this manner a new life gradually took possession
of cosette the relations which marriage creates visits the care
of the house pleasures great matters cosettes pleasures were not
costly they consisted in one thing being with marius the great
occupation of her life was to go out with him to remain with him it
was for them a joy that was always fresh to go out arm in arm in the
face of the sun in the open street without hiding themselves before
the whole world both of them completely alone
cosette had one vexation toussaint could not get on with nicolette the
soldering of two elderly maids being impossible and she went away
the grandfather was well marius argued a case here and there aunt
gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her
beside the new household jean valjean came every day
the address as thou disappeared the you the madame the monsieur
jean rendered him another person to cosette the care which he had
himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding she became more and
more gay and less and less tender yet she still loved him sincerely
one day she said to him suddenly you used to be my father you are
no longer my father you were my uncle you are no longer my uncle you
were monsieur fauchelevent you are jean who are you then i dont
like all this if i did not know how good you are i should be afraid of
he still lived in the rue de lhomme arme because he could not make up
his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where cosette dwelt
at first he only remained a few minutes with cosette and then went
little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief
one would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of
the days which were lengthening he arrived earlier and departed later
one day cosette chanced to say father to him a flash of joy
illuminated jean valjeans melancholy old countenance he caught her
up say jean ah truly she replied with a burst of laughter
monsieur jean that is right said he and he turned aside so that
she might not see him wipe his eyes
chapter iii they recall the garden of the rue plumet
this was the last time after that last flash of light complete
extinction ensued no more familiarity no more good morning with a
kiss never more that word so profoundly sweet my father he was at
his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his
happinesses one after the other and he had this sorrow that after
having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose
the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar in
short it sufficed for him to have an apparition of cosette every day
his whole life was concentrated in that one hour
he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked
to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little
one afternoon it was on one of those early days in april already
warm and fresh the moment of the suns great gayety the gardens which
surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking
the hawthorn was on the point of budding a jewelled garniture of
gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through
the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming
beginning of daisies and buttercups the white butterflies of the
year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the
eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand
auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide marius said
to cosette we said that we would go back to take a look at our garden
in the rue plumet let us go thither we must not be ungrateful and
away they flitted like two swallows towards the spring this garden of
the rue plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn they already
had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their
love the house in the rue plumet being held on a lease still belonged
to cosette they went to that garden and that house there they
found themselves again there they forgot themselves that
evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue des
filles du calvaire madame went out with monsieur and has not yet
returned basque said to him he seated himself in silence and waited
an hour cosette did not return he departed with drooping head
cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so
joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of
nothing else on the morrow she did not notice that she had not seen
in what way did you go thither jean valjean asked her
for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the
young people he was troubled by it marius economy was severe and
that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean he hazarded a
why do you not have a carriage of your own a pretty coupe would only
cost you five hundred francs a month you are rich
it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean she is gone you have not
you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a
box at the theatre there is nothing too fine for you why not profit by
jean valjeans visits were not abridged far from it when it is the
heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope
when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce
forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced
him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good cosette outdid
him jean valjean began again they were never weary marius that word
was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes in this manner
jean valjean contrived to remain a long time
it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side it alleviated his
wounds it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce
m gillenormand sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is
on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home
was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which
had presented itself to the mind of marius was jean valjean really a
chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly
one day he remained still longer than usual on the following day he
observed that there was no fire on the hearth hello he thought no
fire and he furnished the explanation for himself it is perfectly
simple it is april the cold weather has ceased
heavens how cold it is here exclaimed cosette when she entered
was it you who told basque not to make a fire then
yes since we are now in the month of may
but we have a fire until june one is needed all the year in this
that is exactly like one of your ideas retorted cosette
on the following day there was a fire but the two arm chairs were
arranged at the other end of the room near the door  what is the
he went for the arm chairs and restored them to their ordinary place
this fire lighted once more encouraged him however he prolonged the
conversation even beyond its customary limits as he rose to take his
my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday
he said to me cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livres
twenty seven that you own and three that my grandfather gives me i
replied that makes thirty he went on would you have the courage to
live on the three thousand i answered yes on nothing provided
that it was with you and then i asked why do you say that to me he
jean valjean found not a word to answer cosette probably expected some
explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence he went back to the
rue de lhomme arme he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the
door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining
dwelling it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he
his mind was swarming with conjectures it was evident that marius had
his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that
he feared some source that was not pure who knows that he had even
perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he
hesitated before this suspicious fortune and was disinclined to take
it as his own preferring that both he and cosette should remain poor
rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean
moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown
on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering
the ground floor room the arm chairs had disappeared there was not a
ah whats this exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs where
they are no longer here replied jean valjean
it was i who told basque to remove them
i have only a few minutes to stay to day
a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing
i think that basque needed the chairs for the drawing room
jean valjean had not another word to say
to have the chairs carried off the other day you had the fire put out
he did not say adieu cosette but he had not the strength to say
on the following day he did not come cosette only observed the fact in
why said she monsieur jean has not been here today
and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it
being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius
on the following day he did not come
cosette paid no heed to this passed her evening and slept well that
night as usual and thought of it only when she woke she was so happy
she speedily despatched nicolette to m jeans house to inquire whether
he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening nicolette
brought back the reply of m jean that he was not ill he was busy he
would come soon as soon as he was able moreover he was on the point
of taking a little journey madame must remember that it was his custom
to take trips from time to time they were not to worry about him they
nicolette on entering m jeans had repeated to him her mistress very
words that madame had sent her to inquire why m jean bad not come on
the preceding evening it is two days since i have been there said
but the remark passed unnoticed by nicolette who did not report it to
during the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833
the rare passersby in the marais the petty shopkeepers the loungers on
thresholds noticed an old man neatly clad in black who emerged every
day at the same hour towards nightfall from the rue de lhomme arme
on the side of the rue sainte croix de la bretonnerie passed in front
of the blancs manteaux gained the rue culture sainte catherine and
on arriving at the rue de lecharpe turned to the left and entered the
there he walked at a slow pace with his head strained forward seeing
nothing hearing nothing his eye immovably fixed on a point which
seemed to be a star to him which never varied and which was no
other than the corner of the rue des filles du calvaire the nearer he
approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up a sort
of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora he had a fascinated
and much affected air his lips indulged in obscure movements as though
he were talking to some one whom he did not see he smiled vaguely and
advanced as slowly as possible one would have said that while desirous
of reaching his destination he feared the moment when he should be
close at hand when only a few houses remained between him and that
street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a
degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer
advancing at all the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his
eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole
whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he
reached the rue des filles du calvaire then he halted he trembled he
thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of
the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic
look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible
and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him then a tear
which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids and had become
large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at
his mouth the old man tasted its bitter flavor thus he remained for
several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same
road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his
little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the
rue des filles du calvaire he halted half way in the rue saint louis
sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer
one day he stopped at the corner of the rue culture sainte catherine and
looked at the rue des filles du calvaire from a distance then he
shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself
soon he no longer came as far as the rue saint louis he got as far as
the rue pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no
further than the rue des trois pavillons then he did not overstep the
blancs manteaux one would have said that he was a pendulum which was
no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before
every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the
same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without
himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it his whole
countenance expressed this single idea what is the use his eye was
dim no more radiance his tears were also exhausted they no longer
collected in the corner of his eye lid that thoughtful eye was dry the
old mans head was still craned forward his chin moved at times the
folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold sometimes when the
weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened
the good women of the quarter said he is an innocent the children
chapter i pity for the unhappy but indulgence for the happy
it is a terrible thing to be happy how content one is how
all sufficient one finds it how being in possession of the false
object of life happiness one forgets the true object duty
let us say however that the reader would do wrong were he to blame
marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions
to m fauchelevent and since that time he had feared to put any to
jean valjean he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed
himself to be drawn he had often said to himself that he had done
wrong in making that concession to despair he had confined himself to
gradually estranging jean valjean from his house and to effacing him
as much as possible from cosettes mind he had in a manner always
placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this
way she would not perceive nor think of the latter it was more than
marius did what he considered necessary and just he thought that he had
serious reasons which the reader has already seen and others which will
be seen later on for getting rid of jean valjean without harshness but
chance having ordained that he should encounter in a case which he had
argued a former employee of the laffitte establishment he had acquired
mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been
able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had
promised to guard and out of consideration for jean valjeans perilous
position he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to
perform the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some
one whom he sought with all possible discretion in the meanwhile he
as for cosette she had not been initiated into any of these secrets
but it would be harsh to condemn her also
there existed between marius and her an all powerful magnetism which
caused her to do instinctively and almost mechanically what marius
wished she was conscious of marius will in the direction of monsieur
jean she conformed to it her husband had not been obliged to say
anything to her she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his
tacit intentions and obeyed blindly her obedience in this instance
consisted in not remembering what marius forgot she was not obliged to
make any effort to accomplish this without her knowing why herself and
without his having any cause to accuse her of it her soul had become
so wholly her husbands that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius
let us not go too far however in what concerns jean valjean this
forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial she was rather
heedless than forgetful at bottom she was sincerely attached to the
man whom she had so long called her father but she loved her husband
still more dearly this was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of
her heart which leaned to one side only
it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed
her surprise then marius calmed her he is absent i think did not
he say that he was setting out on a journey that is true thought
cosette he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion but not for so
long two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire in the
rue de lhomme arme whether m jean had returned from his journey jean
valjean caused the answer no to be given
cosette asked nothing more since she had but one need on earth marius
let us also say that on their side cosette and marius had also
been absent they had been to vernon marius had taken cosette to his
marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean cosette allowed it
moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the
ingratitude of children is not always a thing so deserving of reproach
as it is supposed it is the ingratitude of nature nature as we have
elsewhere said looks before her nature divides living beings into
those who are arriving and those who are departing those who are
departing are turned towards the shadows those who are arriving towards
the light hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old and
involuntary on the part of the young this breach at first insensible
increases slowly like all separations of branches the boughs without
becoming detached from the trunk grow away from it it is no fault of
theirs youth goes where there is joy festivals vivid lights love
old age goes towards the end they do not lose sight of each other but
there is no longer a close connection young people feel the cooling
off of life old people that of the tomb let us not blame these poor
chapter ii last flickerings of a lamp without oil
one day jean valjean descended his staircase took three steps in the
street seated himself on a post on that same stone post where gavroche
had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of
june he remained there a few moments then went up stairs again this
was the last oscillation of the pendulum on the following day he did
not leave his apartment on the day after that he did not leave his
his portress who prepared his scanty repasts a few cabbages or
potatoes with bacon glanced at the brown earthenware plate and
but you ate nothing yesterday poor dear man
look at the water jug it is empty
that proves that you have drunk it does not prove that you have
well said jean valjean what if i felt hungry only for water
that is called thirst and when one does not eat at the same time it
or at trinity day why not to day is it the thing to say i will eat
to morrow the idea of leaving my platter without even touching it my
i promise you that i will eat them he said in his benevolent voice
i am not pleased with you replied the portress
jean valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman there are
streets in paris through which no one ever passes and houses to which
no one ever comes he was in one of those streets and one of those
while he still went out he had purchased of a coppersmith for a few
sous a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite
his bed that gibbet is always good to look at
a week passed and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room he
still remained in bed the portress said to her husband the good man
upstairs yonder does not get up he no longer eats he will not last
long that man has his sorrows that he has you wont get it out of my
head that his daughter has made a bad marriage
the porter replied with the tone of marital sovereignty
if hes rich let him have a doctor if he is not rich let him go
without if he has no doctor he will die
the portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her
pavement with an old knife and as she tore out the blades she
its a shame such a neat old man hes as white as a chicken
she caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of
the street she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs
its on the second floor said she you have only to enter as the
good man no longer stirs from his bed the door is always unlocked
the doctor saw jean valjean and spoke with him
when he came down again the portress interrogated him
everything and nothing he is a man who to all appearances has lost
some person who is dear to him people die of that
he told me that he was in good health
yes replied the doctor but some one else besides must come
chapter iii a pen is heavy to the man who lifted the fauchelevents
one evening jean valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his
elbow he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse his breath
was short and halted at times he recognized the fact that he was weaker
than he had ever been before then no doubt under the pressure of some
supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting
posture and dressed himself he put on his old workingmans clothes as
he no longer went out he had returned to them and preferred them he
was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting
his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his
since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antechamber in
order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible
he opened the valise and drew from it cosettes outfit
the bishops candlesticks were in their place on the chimney piece he
took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks
then although it was still broad daylight it was summer he lighted
them in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight
every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another
exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down it was not ordinary
fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it it was the remnant
of all movement possible to him it was life drained which flows away
drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed
the chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of
that mirror so fatal for him so providential for marius in which
he had read cosettes reversed writing on the blotting book he caught
sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself he was
eighty years old before marius marriage he would have hardly been
taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty what he bore on his
brow was no longer the wrinkles of age it was the mysterious mark of
death the hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there his
cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would
lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corners of his
mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs he
gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he
was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some
he was in that condition the last phase of dejection in which sorrow
no longer flows it is coagulated so to speak there is something on
night had come he laboriously dragged a table and the old arm chair to
the fireside and placed upon the table a pen some ink and some paper
that done he had a fainting fit when he recovered consciousness he
was thirsty as he could not lift the jug he tipped it over painfully
as neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time the point
of the pen had curled up the ink had dried away he was forced to rise
and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish
without pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was
compelled to write with the back of the pen he wiped his brow from time
then he turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not
stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects
these contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes
all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of
him he rested his elbows on the table which was illuminated by the
bishops candles and took up the pen his hand trembled he wrote slowly
cosette i bless thee i am going to explain to thee thy husband was
right in giving me to understand that i ought to go away but there is
a little error in what he believed though he was in the right he is
excellent love him well even after i am dead monsieur pontmercy love
my darling child well cosette this paper will be found this is what
i wish to say to thee thou wilt see the figures if i have the strength
to recall them listen well this money is really thine here is the
whole matter white jet comes from norway black jet comes from england
black glass jewellery comes from germany jet is the lightest the most
precious the most costly imitations can be made in france as well as
in germany what is needed is a little anvil two inches square and a
lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax the wax was formerly
made with resin and lampblack and cost four livres the pound i
invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine it does not
cost more than thirty sous and is much better buckles are made with
a violet glass which is stuck fast by means of this wax to a little
framework of black iron the glass must be violet for iron jewellery
and black for gold jewellery spain buys a great deal of it it is the
here he paused the pen fell from his fingers he was seized by one of
those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being
the poor man clasped his head in both hands and meditated
oh he exclaimed within himself lamentable cries heard by god
alone all is over i shall never see her more she is a smile which
passed over me i am about to plunge into the night without even seeing
her again oh one minute one instant to hear her voice to touch her
dress to gaze upon her upon her the angel and then to die it is
nothing to die what is frightful is to die without seeing her she
would smile on me she would say a word to me would that do any harm to
any one no all is over and forever here i am all alone my god my
god i shall never see her again at that moment there came a knock at
chapter iv a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening
that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius
left the table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having
a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying the person who
cosette had taken the grandfathers arm and was strolling in the garden
a letter like a man may have an unprepossessing exterior coarse
paper coarsely folded the very sight of certain missives is
the letter which basque had brought was of this sort
marius took it it smelled of tobacco nothing evokes a memory like an
odor marius recognized that tobacco he looked at the superscription
to monsieur monsieur le baron pommerci at his hotel the recognition
of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well it may be
marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes
the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a
whole world within him this was certainly the paper the fashion
of folding the dull tint of ink it was certainly the well known
thus strange freak of chance one of the two scents which he had so
