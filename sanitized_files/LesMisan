society which was seizing fast upon him nevertheless it was a question
of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every
moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did
himself that sentence freighted with calamity which descended
ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility
afforded besides the galleys a possible death penalty in case his
identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end
thereafter in condemnation who was this man what was the nature of his
apathy was it imbecility or craft did he understand too well or did
he not understand at all these were questions which divided the crowd
and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and
puzzling in this case the drama was not only melancholy it was also
the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well in that
provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar
and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris as well as at
romorantin or at montbrison and which to day having become classic is
no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom
it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic
stride a tongue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman
a spouse paris the centre of art and civilization the king
the monarch monseigneur the bishop a sainted pontiff the
district attorney the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the
arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis
xiv the grand age a theatre the temple of melpomene the reigning
family the august blood of our kings a concert a musical solemnity
the general commandant of the province the illustrious warrior who
etc the pupils in the seminary these tender levities errors imputed
to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the
columns of those organs etc the lawyer had accordingly begun with an
explanation as to the theft of the apples an awkward matter couched
in fine style but benigne bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a
chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself
from the situation in stately fashion the lawyer established the fact
that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved
his client whom he in his character of counsel persisted in calling
champmathieu had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that
branch by any one he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer
preferred to call a bough in his possession but he said that he had
found it broken off and lying on the ground and had picked it up
where was there any proof to the contrary no doubt that branch had been
broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away
by the alarmed marauder there was no doubt that there had been a
thief in the case but what proof was there that that thief had been
champmathieu one thing only his character as an ex convict the
lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be unhappily
well attested the accused had resided at faverolles the accused had
exercised the calling of a tree pruner there the name of champmathieu
might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in
short four witnesses recognize champmathieu positively and without
hesitation as that convict jean valjean to these signs to this
testimony the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his
client the denial of an interested party but supposing that he was
the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the
apples that was a presumption at the most not a proof the prisoner
it was true and his counsel in good faith was obliged to admit it
had adopted a bad system of defence he obstinately denied everything
the theft and his character of convict an admission upon this last
point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the
indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but
the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would
save everything by admitting nothing it was an error but ought not the
paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration this man
was visibly stupid long continued wretchedness in the galleys long
misery outside the galleys had brutalized him etc he defended himself
badly was that a reason for condemning him as for the affair with
little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into
the case the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court if
the identity of jean valjean appeared to them to be evident to apply
to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has
broken his ban and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon
the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence he was
violent and florid as district attorneys usually are
he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and
skilfully took advantage of this loyalty he reached the accused through
all the concessions made by his lawyer the advocate had seemed to admit
that the prisoner was jean valjean he took note of this so this man
was jean valjean this point had been conceded to the accusation and
could no longer be disputed here by means of a clever
autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime the
district attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic
school then dawning under the name of the satanic school which
had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and the
oriflamme he attributed not without some probability to the influence
of this perverse literature the crime of champmathieu or rather
to speak more correctly of jean valjean having exhausted these
considerations he passed on to jean valjean himself who was this jean
valjean description of jean valjean a monster spewed forth etc
the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of
theramene which is not useful to tragedy but which every day renders
great services to judicial eloquence the audience and the jury
shuddered the description finished the district attorney resumed
with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the
journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day and
it is such a man etc etc etc vagabond beggar without means of
existence etc etc inured by his past life to culpable deeds and
but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys as was proved by the
crime committed against little gervais etc etc it is such a man
caught upon the highway in the very act of theft a few paces from a
wall that had been scaled still holding in his hand the object
stolen who denies the crime the theft the climbing the wall denies
everything denies even his own identity in addition to a hundred
other proofs to which we will not recur four witnesses recognize
him javert the upright inspector of police javert and three of
his former companions in infamy the convicts brevet chenildieu and
cochepaille what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming
unanimity his denial what obduracy you will do justice gentlemen
of the jury etc etc while the district attorney was speaking the
accused listened to him open mouthed with a sort of amazement in which
some admiration was assuredly blended he was evidently surprised that
a man could talk like that from time to time at those energetic
moments of the prosecutors speech when eloquence which cannot contain
itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the
accused like a storm he moved his head slowly from right to left and
from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which
he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument two or
three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in
a low voice that is what comes of not having asked m baloup the
district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid
attitude evidently deliberate which denoted not imbecility but craft
skill a habit of deceiving justice and which set forth in all its
nakedness the profound perversity of this man he ended by making
his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding a severe
at that time as the reader will remember it was penal servitude for
the counsel for the defence rose began by complimenting monsieur
lavocat general on his admirable speech then replied as best he
could but he weakened the ground was evidently slipping away from
the moment for closing the debate had arrived the president had the
accused stand up and addressed to him the customary question have you
the man did not appear to understand as he stood there twisting in his
this time the man heard it he seemed to understand he made a motion
like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at
the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid
his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench
took another look and all at once fixing his glance upon the
district attorney he began to speak it was like an eruption
it seemed from the manner in which the words escaped from his
mouth incoherent impetuous pell mell tumbling over each other as
though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once he said
this is what i have to say that i have been a wheelwright in paris
and that it was with monsieur baloup it is a hard trade in the
wheelwrights trade one works always in the open air in courtyards
under sheds when the masters are good never in closed workshops
because space is required you see in winter one gets so cold that one
beats ones arms together to warm ones self but the masters dont like
it they say it wastes time handling iron when there is ice between
the paving stones is hard work that wears a man out quickly one is old
while he is still quite young in that trade at forty a man is done for
i was fifty three i was in a bad state and then workmen are so mean
when a man is no longer young they call him nothing but an old bird
old beast i was not earning more than thirty sous a day they paid me
as little as possible the masters took advantage of my age and then i
had my daughter who was a laundress at the river she earned a little
also it sufficed for us two she had trouble also all day long up to
her waist in a tub in rain in snow when the wind cuts your face when
it freezes it is all the same you must still wash there are people
who have not much linen and wait until late if you do not wash you
lose your custom the planks are badly joined and water drops on you
from everywhere you have your petticoats all damp above and below that
penetrates she has also worked at the laundry of the enfants rouges
where the water comes through faucets you are not in the tub there you
wash at the faucet in front of you and rinse in a basin behind you as
it is enclosed you are not so cold but there is that hot steam which
is terrible and which ruins your eyes she came home at seven oclock
in the evening and went to bed at once she was so tired her husband
beat her she is dead we have not been very happy she was a good girl
who did not go to the ball and who was very peaceable i remember
one shrove tuesday when she went to bed at eight oclock there i am
telling the truth you have only to ask ah yes how stupid i am paris
is a gulf who knows father champmathieu there but m baloup does i
tell you go see at m baloups and after all i dont know what is
the man ceased speaking and remained standing he had said these things
in a loud rapid hoarse voice with a sort of irritated and savage
ingenuousness once he paused to salute some one in the crowd the sort
of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came
like hiccoughs and to each he added the gesture of a wood cutter who is
splitting wood when he had finished the audience burst into a laugh
he stared at the public and perceiving that they were laughing and
not understanding why he began to laugh himself
the president an attentive and benevolent man raised his voice
he reminded the gentlemen of the jury that the sieur baloup formerly
a master wheelwright with whom the accused stated that he had served
had been summoned in vain he had become bankrupt and was not to be
found then turning to the accused he enjoined him to listen to what
he was about to say and added you are in a position where reflection
is necessary the gravest presumptions rest upon you and may induce
vital results prisoner in your own interests i summon you for the
last time to explain yourself clearly on two points in the first place
did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard break
the branch and steal the apples that is to say commit the crime
of breaking in and theft in the second place are you the discharged
the prisoner shook his head with a capable air like a man who has
thoroughly understood and who knows what answer he is going to make he
opened his mouth turned towards the president and said
then he stared at his cap stared at the ceiling and held his peace
prisoner said the district attorney in a severe voice pay
attention you are not answering anything that has been asked of you
your embarrassment condemns you it is evident that your name is not
champmathieu that you are the convict jean valjean concealed first
under the name of jean mathieu which was the name of his mother that
you went to auvergne that you were born at faverolles where you were
a pruner of trees it is evident that you have been guilty of entering
and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard the gentlemen
of the jury will form their own opinion
the prisoner had finally resumed his seat he arose abruptly when the
you are very wicked that you are this what i wanted to say i could
not find words for it at first i have stolen nothing i am a man who
does not have something to eat every day i was coming from ailly i
was walking through the country after a shower which had made the whole
country yellow even the ponds were overflowed and nothing sprang from
the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside i
found a broken branch with apples on the ground i picked up the branch
without knowing that it would get me into trouble i have been in
prison and they have been dragging me about for the last three months
more than that i cannot say people talk against me they tell me
answer the gendarme who is a good fellow nudges my elbow and says
to me in a low voice come answer i dont know how to explain i
have no education i am a poor man that is where they wrong me because
they do not see this i have not stolen i picked up from the ground
things that were lying there you say jean valjean jean mathieu i
dont know those persons they are villagers i worked for m baloup
boulevard de lhopital my name is champmathieu you are very clever to
tell me where i was born i dont know myself its not everybody
who has a house in which to come into the world that would be too
convenient i think that my father and mother were people who strolled
along the highways i know nothing different when i was a child
they called me young fellow now they call me old fellow those are my
baptismal names take that as you like i have been in auvergne i have
been at faverolles pardi well cant a man have been in auvergne or
at faverolles without having been in the galleys i tell you that i
have not stolen and that i am father champmathieu i have been with m
baloup i have had a settled residence you worry me with your nonsense
there why is everybody pursuing me so furiously
the district attorney had remained standing he addressed the
monsieur le president in view of the confused but exceedingly clever
denials of the prisoner who would like to pass himself off as an idiot
but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to that we
demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to
summon once more into this place the convicts brevet cochepaille and
chenildieu and police inspector javert and question them for the last
time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean
i would remind the district attorney said the president that
police inspector javert recalled by his duties to the capital of a
neighboring arrondissement left the court room and the town as soon as
he had made his deposition we have accorded him permission with the
consent of the district attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner
that is true mr president responded the district attorney in the
absence of sieur javert i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of
the jury of what he said here a few hours ago javert is an estimable
man who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but
important functions these are the terms of his deposition i do not
even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to
give the lie to the prisoners denial i recognize him perfectly the
name of this man is not champmathieu he is an ex convict named jean
valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared it is only with
extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term he
underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft he made five or
six attempts to escape besides the theft from little gervais and from
the pierron orchard i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of
his grace the late bishop of d i often saw him at the time when i
was adjutant of the galley guard at the prison in toulon i repeat that
this extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression
on the public and on the jury the district attorney concluded by
insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet
chenildieu and cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly
the president transmitted the order to an usher and a moment later
the door of the witnesses room opened the usher accompanied by a
gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance introduced the convict
brevet the audience was in suspense and all breasts heaved as though
the ex convict brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central
prisons brevet was a person sixty years of age who had a sort of
business mans face and the air of a rascal the two sometimes go
together in prison whither fresh misdeeds had led him he had become
something in the nature of a turnkey he was a man of whom his superiors
said he tries to make himself of use the chaplains bore good
testimony as to his religious habits it must not be forgotten that this
brevet said the president you have undergone an ignominious
nevertheless continued the president even in the man whom the law
has degraded there may remain when the divine mercy permits it a
sentiment of honor and of equity it is to this sentiment that i
appeal at this decisive hour if it still exists in you and i hope
it does reflect before replying to me consider on the one hand this
man whom a word from you may ruin on the other hand justice which a
word from you may enlighten the instant is solemn there is still time
to retract if you think you have been mistaken rise prisoner brevet
take a good look at the accused recall your souvenirs and tell us on
your soul and conscience if you persist in recognizing this man as your
brevet looked at the prisoner then turned towards the court
yes mr president i was the first to recognize him and i stick to
it that man is jean valjean who entered at toulon in 1796 and left in
1815 i left a year later he has the air of a brute now but it must be
because age has brutalized him he was sly at the galleys i recognize
take your seat said the president prisoner remain standing
chenildieu was brought in a prisoner for life as was indicated by his
red cassock and his green cap he was serving out his sentence at the
galleys of toulon whence he had been brought for this case he was a
small man of about fifty brisk wrinkled frail yellow brazen faced
feverish who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and
his whole person and an immense force in his glance his companions in
the galleys had nicknamed him i deny god je nie dieu chenildieu
the president addressed him in nearly the same words which he had
used to brevet at the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which
deprived him of the right to take an oath chenildieu raised his
head and looked the crowd in the face the president invited him to
reflection and asked him as he had asked brevet if he persisted in
pardieu as if i didnt recognize him we were attached to the same
chain for five years so you are sulking old fellow
the usher brought in cochepaille he was another convict for life who
had come from the galleys and was dressed in red like chenildieu was
a peasant from lourdes and a half bear of the pyrenees he had guarded
the flocks among the mountains and from a shepherd he had slipped into
a brigand cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid
than the prisoner he was one of those wretched men whom nature has
sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing
the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words
and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted without
hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before
he is jean valjean said cochepaille he was even called
jean the screw because he was so strong
each of these affirmations from these three men evidently sincere and
in good faith had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the
prisoner a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a
the prisoner had listened to them with that astounded face which was
according to the accusation his principal means of defence at the
first the gendarmes his neighbors had heard him mutter between his
teeth ah well hes a nice one after the second he said a little
louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good at the
have you heard prisoner what have you to say
an uproar broke out among the audience and was communicated to the
jury it was evident that the man was lost
ushers said the president enforce silence i am going to sum up the
at that moment there was a movement just beside the president a voice
all who heard that voice were chilled so lamentable and terrible was
it all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded a man
placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the
court had just risen had pushed open the half door which separated the
tribunal from the audience and was standing in the middle of the hall
the president the district attorney m bamatabois twenty persons
it was he in fact the clerks lamp illumined his countenance he held
his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat
was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly
his hair which had still been gray on his arrival in arras was now
entirely white it had turned white during the hour he had sat there
all heads were raised the sensation was indescribable there was
a momentary hesitation in the audience the voice had been so
heart rending the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did
not understand at first they asked themselves whether he had indeed
uttered that cry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been
this indecision only lasted a few seconds even before the president
and the district attorney could utter a word before the ushers and the
gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that
moment m madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses cochepaille
all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that
they did not know him cochepaille who was intimidated made a military
salute m madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in
gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released mr
president have me arrested he is not the man whom you are in search
of it is i i am jean valjean
not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been
followed by a silence like that of the grave those within the hall
experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when
in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and
sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a
few low toned words with the assistant judges he addressed the public
gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident
which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a
sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express you all know by
reputation at least the honorable m madeleine mayor of m sur m
if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in
requesting him to attend to m madeleine and to conduct him to his
m madeleine did not allow the district attorney to finish he
interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority these are the
words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written
down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene
and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty
i thank you mr district attorney but i am not mad you shall see
you were on the point of committing a great error release this man i
am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal i am the only one
here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth god
who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that
suffices you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i
concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become
a mayor i have tried to re enter the ranks of the honest it seems that
that is not to be done in short there are many things which i cannot
tell i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it
one of these days i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is true it is
true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that
jean valjean was a very vicious wretch perhaps it was not altogether
his fault listen honorable judges a man who has been so greatly
humbled as i have has neither any remonstrances to make to providence
nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i
have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict
what he is reflect upon that if you please before going to the
galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort
of idiot the galleys wrought a change in me i was stupid i became
vicious i was a block of wood i became a firebrand later on
indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me but pardon
me you cannot understand what i am saying you will find at my house
among the ashes in the fireplace the forty sou piece which i stole
seven years ago from little gervais i have nothing farther to add
take me good god the district attorney shakes his head you say m
madeleine has gone mad you do not believe me that is distressing do
not at least condemn this man what these men do not recognize me i
wish javert were here he would recognize me
nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which
he turned to the three convicts and said
well i recognize you do you remember brevet
he paused hesitated for an instant and said
do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you
brevet gave a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to foot with
chenildieu you who conferred on yourself the name of jenie dieu
your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn because you one day laid
your shoulder against the chafing dish full of coals in order to efface
the three letters t f p which are still visible nevertheless
cochepaille you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped
in blue letters with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of
the emperor at cannes march 1 1815 pull up your sleeve
cochepaille pushed up his sleeve all eyes were focused on him and on
a gendarme held a light close to it there was the date
the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile
which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of
it it was a smile of triumph it was also a smile of despair
you see plainly he said that i am jean valjean
in that chamber there were no longer either judges accusers nor
gendarmes there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts
no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon
to play the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of
prosecuting the president that he was there to preside the counsel for
the defence that he was there to defend it was a striking circumstance
that no question was put that no authority intervened the peculiarity
of sublime spectacles is that they capture all souls and turn witnesses
into spectators no one probably could have explained what he felt
no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid
outburst of a grand light all felt themselves inwardly dazzled
it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes that was
clear the appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light
that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without
any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric
revelation understood instantly and at a single glance the simple
and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so
that another man might not be condemned in his stead the details the
hesitations little possible oppositions were swallowed up in that vast
it was an impression which vanished speedily but which was irresistible
i do not wish to disturb the court further resumed jean valjean i
shall withdraw since you do not arrest me i have many things to do
the district attorney knows who i am he knows whither i am going he
he directed his steps towards the door not a voice was raised not an
arm extended to hinder him all stood aside at that moment there was
about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside
and make way for a man he traversed the crowd slowly it was never
known who opened the door but it is certain that he found the door open
when he reached it on arriving there he turned round and said
i am at your command mr district attorney
all of you all who are present consider me worthy of pity do you
not good god when i think of what i was on the point of doing i
consider that i am to be envied nevertheless i should have preferred
he withdrew and the door closed behind him as it had opened for those
who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some
less than an hour after this the verdict of the jury freed the said
champmathieu from all accusations and champmathieu being at once
released went off in a state of stupefaction thinking that all men
were fools and comprehending nothing of this vision
chapter i in what mirror m madeleine contemplates his hair
the day had begun to dawn fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish
night filled with happy visions at daybreak she fell asleep sister
simplice who had been watching with her availed herself of this
slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona the worthy sister
had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending
over her drugs and phials and scrutinizing things very closely on
account of the dimness which the half light of dawn spreads over all
objects suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek m
madeleine stood before her he had just entered silently
not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy
she explained to him what had passed that fantine had been very ill the
day before and that she was better now because she thought that the
mayor had gone to montfermeil to get her child the sister dared not
question the mayor but she perceived plainly from his air that he had
all that is good said he you were right not to undeceive her
yes responded the sister but now mr mayor she will see you and
will not see her child what shall we say to her
but we cannot tell a lie murmured the sister half aloud
it was broad daylight in the room the light fell full on m madeleines
face the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it
good god sir she exclaimed what has happened to you your hair is
sister simplice had no mirror she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out
the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether
a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed m madeleine took
the mirror looked at his hair and said
he uttered the word indifferently and as though his mind were on
the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a
is not monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her
said the sister hardly venturing to put the question
of course but it will take two or three days at least
if she were not to see monsieur le maire until that time went on
the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur le maire had
returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when
the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur le maire had just
come with the child we should not have to enact a lie
m madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments then he said with his
no sister i must see her i may perhaps be in haste
the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicated
an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayors speech she
replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully
in that case she is asleep but monsieur le maire may enter
he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of
which might awaken the sick woman then he entered fantines chamber
approached the bed and drew aside the curtains she was asleep her
breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar
to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are
watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned
to death but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of
ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance and which
transfigured her in her sleep her pallor had become whiteness her
cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her
youth and her virginity which remained to her palpitated though they
remained closed and drooping her whole person was trembling with an
indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and bear her
away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be
seen to see her thus one would never have dreamed that she was
an invalid whose life was almost despaired of she resembled rather
something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of
the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and
seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time
the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in
which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul
m madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing
in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months
before on the day when he had come for the first time to see her
in that asylum they were both still there in the same attitude she
sleeping he praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair
the sister had not entered with him he stood beside the bed with his
finger on his lips as though there were some one in the chamber whom he
she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile
she made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was joy itself
that simple question and cosette was put with so profound a faith
with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of
doubt that he found not a word of reply she continued
i knew that you were there i was asleep but i saw you i have seen
you for a long long time i have been following you with my eyes all
night long you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of
but she resumed tell me where cosette is why did not you place her
on my bed against the moment of my waking
he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to
fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance
he came to the aid of m madeleine
calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here
fantines eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light she clasped
her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to
prayer in the way of violence and tenderness
touching illusion of a mother cosette was for her still the little
not yet said the doctor not just now you still have some fever
the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm you must be
but i am cured oh i tell you that i am cured what an ass that doctor
is the idea i want to see my child
you see said the doctor how excited you become so long as you are
in this state i shall oppose your having your child it is not enough
to see her it is necessary that you should live for her when you are
reasonable i will bring her to you myself
i beg your pardon doctor i really beg your pardon formerly i should
never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened
to me that i sometimes do not know what i am saying i understand you
you fear the emotion i will wait as long as you like but i swear to
you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter i have been
seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening
do you know if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very
gently that is all is it not quite natural that i should desire to see
my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from montfermeil i
am not angry i know well that i am about to be happy all night long i
have seen white things and persons who smiled at me when monsieur le
docteur pleases he shall bring me cosette i have no longer any fever
i am well i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter
with me any more but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not
stir to please these ladies here when it is seen that i am very calm
they will say she must have her child
m madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed she turned towards
him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she
expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in
order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about
bringing cosette to her but while she controlled herself she could not
did you have a pleasant trip monsieur le maire oh how good you were
to go and get her for me only tell me how she is did she stand the
journey well alas she will not recognize me she must have forgotten
me by this time poor darling children have no memories they are like
birds a child sees one thing to day and another thing to morrow and
thinks of nothing any longer and did she have white linen did those
thenardiers keep her clean how have they fed her oh if you only knew
how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all
the time of my wretchedness now it is all past i am happy oh how i
should like to see her do you think her pretty monsieur le maire
is not my daughter beautiful you must have been very cold in that
diligence could she not be brought for just one little instant she
might be taken away directly afterwards tell me you are the master it
he took her hand cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well
you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much
vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and
in fact fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word
fantine did not murmur she feared that she had injured by her too
passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of
inspiring and she began to talk of indifferent things
montfermeil is quite pretty is it not people go there on pleasure
parties in summer are the thenardiers prosperous there are not many
travellers in their parts that inn of theirs is a sort of a cook shop
m madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety
it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind
now hesitated the doctor having finished his visit retired sister
but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed
i hear her mon dieu i hear her
she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath
there was a child playing in the yard the child of the portress or
of some work woman it was one of those accidents which are always
occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage setting
of mournful scenes the child a little girl was going and coming
running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice
alas in what are the plays of children not intermingled it was this
oh she resumed it is my cosette i recognize her voice
the child retreated as it had come the voice died away fantine
listened for a while longer then her face clouded over and m
madeleine heard her say in a low voice how wicked that doctor is not
to allow me to see my daughter that man has an evil countenance that
but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again she
continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how
happy we are going to be we shall have a little garden the very first
thing m madeleine has promised it to me my daughter will play in the
garden she must know her letters by this time i will make her spell
she will run over the grass after butterflies i will watch her then
she will take her first communion ah when will she take her first
one two three four she is seven years old in five years she will
have a white veil and openwork stockings she will look like a little
woman o my good sister you do not know how foolish i become when i
he had released fantines hand he listened to her words as one listens
to the sighing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind
absorbed in reflection which had no bottom all at once she ceased
speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically fantine
she no longer spoke she no longer breathed she had raised herself to
a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face
which had been radiant but a moment before was ghastly and she
seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something
alarming at the other extremity of the room
good god he exclaimed what ails you fantine
she made no reply she did not remove her eyes from the object which
she seemed to see she removed one hand from his arm and with the other
made him a sign to look behind him
the half hour after midnight had just struck when m madeleine quitted
the hall of assizes in arras he regained his inn just in time to set
out again by the mail wagon in which he had engaged his place a little
before six oclock in the morning he had arrived at m sur m and his
first care had been to post a letter to m laffitte then to enter the
however he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of
assizes when the district attorney recovering from his first shock
had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of
m sur m to declare that his convictions had not been in the least
modified by that curious incident which would be explained thereafter
and to demand in the meantime the condemnation of that champmathieu
who was evidently the real jean valjean the district attorneys
persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one of
the public of the court and of the jury the counsel for the defence
had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that
in consequence of the revelations of m madeleine that is to say of
the real jean valjean the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly
altered and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent
man thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas not very fresh
unfortunately upon judicial errors etc etc the president in his
summing up had joined the counsel for the defence and in a few minutes
the jury had thrown champmathieu out of the case
nevertheless the district attorney was bent on having a jean valjean
and as he had no longer champmathieu he took madeleine
immediately after champmathieu had been set at liberty the
district attorney shut himself up with the president they conferred as
to the necessity of seizing the person of m le maire of m sur m
this phrase in which there was a great deal of of is the
district attorneys written with his own hand on the minutes of his
report to the attorney general his first emotion having passed off the
president did not offer many objections justice must after all take
its course and then when all was said although the president was
a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man he was at the same time a
devoted and almost an ardent royalist and he had been shocked to hear
the mayor of m sur m say the emperor and not bonaparte when alluding
the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched the
district attorney forwarded it to m sur m by a special messenger at
full speed and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert
the reader knows that javert had returned to m sur m immediately after
javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the
order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
the messenger himself was a very clever member of the police who in
two words informed javert of what had taken place at arras the order
of arrest signed by the district attorney was couched in these words
inspector javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine mayor
of m sur m who in this days session of the court was recognized as
any one who did not know javert and who had chanced to see him at the
moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary could have
divined nothing of what had taken place and would have thought his air
the most ordinary in the world he was cool calm grave his gray
hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples and he had just mounted
the stairs with his habitual deliberation any one who was thoroughly
acquainted with him and who had examined him attentively at the moment
