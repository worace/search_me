he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had
struck that following his father he too was about to show himself
brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast
to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that
he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle
and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the
street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war
he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he
he thought of his fathers sword which his grandfather had sold to a
second hand dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted he said to
himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from
him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it
was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future
that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the
gutters the war of the pavements fusillades through cellar windows
blows given and received in the rear it was because coming from
marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la
chanvrerie it was because after what it had done with the father it
did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword
were there if after taking possession of it at his fathers pillow
he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness
between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his
hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel
he told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that
it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his
grandfather had been the true guardian of his fathers glory and that
it was far better that the colonels sword should be sold at auction
sold to the old clothes man thrown among the old junk than that it
should to day wound the side of his country
this was horrible but what was he to do live without cosette he could
not since she was gone he must needs die had he not given her his
word of honor that he would die she had gone knowing that this meant
that it pleased her that marius should die and then it was clear that
she no longer loved him since she had departed thus without warning
without a word without a letter although she knew his address what
was the good of living and why should he live now and then what
should he retreat after going so far should he flee from danger after
having approached it should he slip away after having come and peeped
into the barricade slip away all in a tremble saying after all i
have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffices this is
civil war and i shall take my leave should he abandon his friends who
were expecting him who were in need of him possibly who were a mere
handful against an army should he be untrue at once to his love to
country to his word should he give to his cowardice the pretext of
patriotism but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father
was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on
the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him march on you
thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his
all at once he raised it a sort of splendid rectification had just been
effected in his mind there is a widening of the sphere of thought which
is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to
be near death the vision of the action into which he felt that he
was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more
as lamentable but as superb the war of the street was suddenly
transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul before the
eye of his thought all the tumultuous interrogation points of revery
recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him he left none of
let us see why should his father be indignant are there not cases
where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty what was there that was
degrading for the son of colonel pontmercy in the combat which was about
to begin it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is something
quite different the question is no longer one of sacred territory but
of a holy idea the country wails that may be but humanity applauds
but is it true that the country does wail france bleeds but liberty
smiles and in the presence of libertys smile france forgets her
wound and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of
view why do we speak of civil war
civil war what does that mean is there a foreign war is not all war
between men war between brothers war is qualified only by its object
there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and
unjust war until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded
war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening
on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary
what have we to reproach that war with war does not become a disgrace
the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for
assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth then
war whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime
outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does
one form of man despise another by what right should the sword of
washington disown the pike of camille desmoulins leonidas against the
stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater the one is
the defender the other the liberator shall we brand every appeal
to arms within a citys limits without taking the object into a
consideration then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould von
blankenheim coligny hedgerow war war of the streets why not that
was the war of ambiorix of artevelde of marnix of pelagius but
ambiorix fought against rome artevelde against france marnix against
spain pelagius against the moors all against the foreigner well the
monarchy is a foreigner oppression is a stranger the right divine is
a stranger despotism violates the moral frontier an invasion violates
the geographical frontier driving out the tyrant or driving out the
english in both cases regaining possession of ones own territory
there comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices after

after aeschylus thrasybulus after diderot danton multitudes have
a tendency to accept the master their mass bears witness to apathy
a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience men must be stirred up

their eyes must be wounded by the true light must be hurled at them
in terrible handfuls they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at

call louis philippe the tyrant no no more than louis xvi both of them
are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles
are not to be parcelled out the logic of the true is rectilinear the
peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance no concessions
then all encroachments on man should be repressed there is a divine
right in louis xvi there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both
represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order
to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must
be done france being always the one to begin when the master falls

consequently what war is greater than that which re establishes

there is no one who has not noticed it in his own case the soul and
therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity has
a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent
extremities and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound
despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues treat subjects
and discuss theses logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread
of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of
thought this was the situation of marius mind
as he meditated thus dejected but resolute hesitating in every
direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his
glance strayed to the interior of the barricade the insurgents
were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there
was perceptible that quasi silence which marks the last stage of
expectation overhead at the small window in the third story marius
descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly
attentive this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc below
by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the paving stones
this head could be vaguely distinguished nothing could be stranger in
that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished
face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and staring and its
yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity one
would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were
about to die a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head
descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first
illustration the grandeurs of despair 4b 14 1 despair
as yet nothing had come ten oclock had sounded from saint merry
enjolras and combeferre had gone and seated themselves carbines in
hand near the outlet of the grand barricade they no longer addressed
each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most
suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice
which seemed to come from the rue saint denis rose and began to sing
distinctly to the old popular air of by the light of the moon this
bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock
a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more
agile than a clown climb over the omnibus and gavroche bounded into the
an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of
would you like my carbine said enjolras to the lad
two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment
as gavroche they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the
vidette of the rue de la petite truanderie the vidette of the lane des
precheurs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was
approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles
the rue de la chanvrerie of which a few paving stones alone were dimly
visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered
to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a
each man had taken up his position for the conflict
forty three insurgents among whom were enjolras combeferre
courfeyrac bossuet joly bahorel and gavroche were kneeling inside
the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the
barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as
though at loop holes attentive mute ready to fire six commanded
by feuilly had installed themselves with their guns levelled at their
shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinthe
several minutes passed thus then a sound of footsteps measured heavy
and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of saint leu
this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous
approached slowly without halt without intermission with a tranquil
and terrible continuity nothing was to be heard but this it was that
combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this
stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it
which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea
of a spectre one thought one heard the terrible statue legion marching
onward this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped it
seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of
the street nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that
dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic
threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about
like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath
ones closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at the moment
when one is dropping off to sleep these were bayonets and gun barrels
confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch
a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting all at once from the
depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since
no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking
at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position
enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone
a flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of a
furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again
a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade the red flag fell
the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the
staff that is to say the very tip of the omnibus pole
bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated
the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing the attack
had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest
it was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very
comrades shouted courfeyrac let us not waste our powder let us
wait until they are in the street before replying
and above all said enjolras let us raise the flag again
he picked up the flag which had fallen precisely at his feet
outside the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard the
who is there here with a bold heart who will plant the flag on the
not a man responded to mount on the barricade at the very moment when
without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply
death the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation enjolras
since they had arrived at corinthe and had begun the construction of
the barricade no attention had been paid to father mabeuf m mabeuf
had not quitted the mob however he had entered the ground floor of the
wine shop and had seated himself behind the counter there he had so to
speak retreated into himself he no longer seemed to look or to think
courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him
of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them
when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were
replying to some one and as soon as he was addressed his lips became
motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive
several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an
attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted
on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a
precipice nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did
not seem as though his mind were in the barricade when each had gone
to take up his position for the combat there remained in the tap room
where javert was bound to the post only a single insurgent with a naked
sword watching over javert and himself mabeuf at the moment of the
attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had
as it were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room
and at the instant when enjolras repeated his appeal does no one
volunteer the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold
of the wine shop his presence produced a sort of commotion in the
it is the voter it is the member of the convention it is the
it is probable that he did not hear them
he strode straight up to enjolras the insurgents withdrawing before him
with a religious fear he tore the flag from enjolras who recoiled in
amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this
old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to
ascend the staircase of paving stones arranged in the barricade this
was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried off with your
hats at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his
white locks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brow
his amazed and open mouth his aged arm upholding the red banner rose
through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch
and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of 93 emerging
from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand
when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible
phantom erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred
invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though
he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the
there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of
prodigies in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag
long live the revolution long live the republic fraternity equality
those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur
of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste it was probably the
commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end
then the same piercing voice which had shouted who goes there
m mabeuf pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of
aberration raised the flag above his head and repeated
a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the
the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag
and fell backwards on the pavement like a log at full length with
rivulets of blood flowed beneath him his aged head pale and sad
one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget
even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached
this is for yourself alone i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm but
this man was anything rather than a regicide i knew him his name was
father mabeuf i do not know what was the matter with him to day but he
was a brave blockhead just look at his head
the head of a blockhead and the heart of a brutus replied enjolras
citizens this is the example which the old give to the young we
hesitated he came we were drawing back he advanced this is what
those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear
this aged man is august in the eyes of his country he has had a long
life and a magnificent death now let us place the body under cover
that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his
father living and may his presence in our midst render the barricade
a murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words
enjolras bent down raised the old mans head and fierce as he was he
kissed him on the brow then throwing wide his arms and handling this
dead man with tender precaution as though he feared to hurt it he
removed his coat showed the bloody holes in it to all and said
chapter iii gavroche would have done better to accept enjolras carbine
they threw a long black shawl of widow hucheloups over father mabeuf
six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and
bore it with bared heads with solemn slowness to the large table in
these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they
were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they
when the corpse passed near javert who was still impassive enjolras
during all this time little gavroche who alone had not quitted his
post but had remained on guard thought he espied some men stealthily
approaching the barricade all at once he shouted
bossuet and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine shop it was
almost too late they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating
above the barricade municipal guards of lofty stature were making
their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut
thrusting before them the urchin who retreated but did not flee
the moment was critical it was that first redoubtable moment of
inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the
water begins to filter through the fissures of dike a second more and
bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering and
killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun the second killed
bahorel with a blow from his bayonet another had already overthrown
courfeyrac who was shouting follow me the largest of all a sort of
colossus marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed the urchin took in
his arms javerts immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and
fired no discharge followed javerts gun was not loaded the municipal
guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child
before the bayonet had touched gavroche the gun slipped from the
soldiers grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the
centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back a second bullet
struck the other guard who had assaulted courfeyrac in the breast and
this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade
marius still concealed in the turn of the rue mondetour had witnessed
shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat but he had not
long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may
be designated as the call of the abyss in the presence of the imminence
of the peril in the presence of the death of m mabeuf that melancholy
enigma in the presence of bahorel killed and courfeyrac shouting
follow me of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to
avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the
conflict his two pistols in hand with his first shot he had saved
amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards
the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal
guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could
now be seen gun in hand rearing themselves to more than half the
they already covered more than two thirds of the barrier but they did
not leap into the enclosure as though wavering in the fear of some
trap they gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lions
den the light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets their
bear skin caps and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces
marius had no longer any weapons he had flung away his discharged
pistols after firing them but he had caught sight of the barrel of
powder in the tap room near the door
as he turned half round gazing in that direction a soldier took aim at
him at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius a hand was laid
on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it this was done by some one
who had darted forward the young workman in velvet trousers the shot
sped traversed the hand and possibly also the workman since he fell
but the ball did not strike marius all this which was rather to be
apprehended than seen through the smoke marius who was entering the
tap room hardly noticed still he had in a confused way perceived
that gun barrel aimed at him and the hand which had blocked it and he
had heard the discharge but in moments like this the things which one
sees vacillate and are precipitated and one pauses for nothing one
feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still and all is cloud
the insurgents surprised but not terrified had rallied enjolras had
shouted wait dont fire at random in the first confusion they
might in fact wound each other the majority of them had ascended
to the window on the first story and to the attic windows whence they
the most determined with enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire and
combeferre had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the
houses at the rear unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and
all this was accomplished without haste with that strange and
threatening gravity which precedes engagements they took aim point
blank on both sides they were so close that they could talk together
when they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of
darting forth an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said
the two discharges took place at the same moment and all disappeared in
an acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak
dull groans when the smoke cleared away the combatants on both sides
could be seen to be thinned out but still in the same positions
reloading in silence all at once a thundering voice was heard
be off with you or ill blow up the barricade
all turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded
marius had entered the tap room and had seized the barrel of powder
then he had taken advantage of the smoke and the sort of obscure mist
which filled the entrenched enclosure to glide along the barricade as
far as that cage of paving stones where the torch was fixed to tear
it from the torch to replace it by the barrel of powder to thrust the
pile of stones under the barrel which was instantly staved in with
a sort of horrible obedience all this had cost marius but the time
necessary to stoop and rise again and now all national guards
municipal guards officers soldiers huddled at the other extremity of
the barricade gazed stupidly at him as he stood with his foot on the
stones his torch in his hand his haughty face illuminated by a fatal
resolution drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable
pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder and giving
be off with you or ill blow up the barricade
marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the
young revolution after the apparition of the old
blow up the barricade said a sergeant and yourself with it
and he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder
but there was no longer any one on the barrier the assailants
abandoning their dead and wounded flowed back pell mell and in disorder
towards the extremity of the street and there were again lost in the
chapter v end of the verses of jean prouvaire
all flocked around marius courfeyrac flung himself on his neck
if it had not been for you i should have been dead began courfeyrac
if it had not been for you i should have been gobbled up added
marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long now it was a
whirlwind this whirlwind which was within him produced on him the
effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away it seemed to him
that he was already at an immense distance from life his two luminous
months of joy and love ending abruptly at that frightful precipice
cosette lost to him that barricade m mabeuf getting himself killed
for the republic himself the leader of the insurgents all these
things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare he was obliged to
make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was
real marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing
is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always
necessary to foresee is the unforeseen he had looked on at his own
drama as a piece which one does not understand
in the mists which enveloped his thoughts he did not recognize javert
who bound to his post had not so much as moved his head during the
whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt
seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of
a judge marius had not even seen him
in the meanwhile the assailants did not stir they could be heard
marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not
venture into it either because they were awaiting orders or because
they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on
this impregnable redoubt the insurgents had posted sentinels and some
of them who were medical students set about caring for the wounded
they had thrown the tables out of the wine shop with the exception of
the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges and of the one on
which lay father mabeuf they had added them to the barricade and had
replaced them in the tap room with mattresses from the bed of the
widow hucheloup and her servants on these mattresses they had laid the
wounded as for the three poor creatures who inhabited corinthe no one
knew what had become of them they were finally found however hidden
a poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade
the roll was called one of the insurgents was missing and who was
it one of the dearest one of the most valiant jean prouvaire he
was sought among the wounded he was not there he was sought among the
dead he was not there he was evidently a prisoner combeferre said to
they have our friend we have their agent are you set on the death of
yes replied enjolras but less so than on the life of jean
this took place in the tap room near javerts post
well resumed combeferre i am going to fasten my handkerchief to
my cane and go as a flag of truce to offer to exchange our man for
listen said enjolras laying his hand on combeferres arm
at the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms
vive la france long live france long live the future
enjolras glanced at javert and said to him
chapter vi the agony of death after the agony of life
a peculiarity of this species of war is that the attack of the
barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants
generally abstain from turning the position either because they
fear ambushes or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the
tortuous streets the insurgents whole attention had been directed
therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always
menaced and there the struggle would infallibly recommence but marius
thought of the little barricade and went thither it was deserted and
guarded only by the fire pot which trembled between the paving stones
moreover the mondetour alley and the branches of the rue de la petite
truanderie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm
as marius was withdrawing after concluding his inspection he heard his
he started for he recognized the voice which had called to him two
hours before through the gate in the rue plumet
only the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath
he looked about him but saw no one
marius thought he had been mistaken that it was an illusion added by
his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around
him he advanced a step in order to quit the distant recess where the
this time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly he looked
he bent down and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself
it was crawling along the pavement it was this that had spoken to him
the fire pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse torn trousers of
coarse velvet bare feet and something which resembled a pool of blood
marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him
marius bent hastily down it was in fact that unhappy child she was
how come you here what are you doing here
there are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings marius cried
you are wounded wait i will carry you into the room they will attend
to you there is it serious how must i take hold of you in order not
to hurt you where do you suffer help my god but why did you come
and he tried to pass his arm under her in order to raise her
she raised her hand to marius and in the middle of that hand marius saw
what is the matter with your hand said he
did you see a gun aimed at you
what madness poor child but so much the better if that is all it is
nothing let me carry you to a bed they will dress your wound one does
the bullet traversed my hand but it came out through my back it is
useless to remove me from this spot i will tell you how you can care
for me better than any surgeon sit down near me on this stone
he obeyed she laid her head on marius knees and without looking at
oh how good this is how comfortable this is there i no longer
she remained silent for a moment then she turned her face with an
do you know what monsieur marius it puzzled me because you entered
that garden it was stupid because it was i who showed you that house
and then i ought to have said to myself that a young man like you 
she paused and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly
existed in her mind she resumed with a heartrending smile
you see you are lost now no one can get out of the barricade it was
i who led you here by the way you are going to die i count upon that
and yet when i saw them taking aim at you i put my hand on the muzzle
of the gun how queer it is but it was because i wanted to die before
you when i received that bullet i dragged myself here no one saw
me no one picked me up i was waiting for you i said so he is not
coming oh if you only knew i bit my blouse i suffered so now i am
well do you remember the day i entered your chamber and when i
looked at myself in your mirror and the day when i came to you on the
boulevard near the washerwomen how the birds sang that was a long time
ago you gave me a hundred sous and i said to you i dont want your
money i hope you picked up your coin you are not rich i did not
think to tell you to pick it up the sun was shining bright and it was
not cold do you remember monsieur marius oh how happy i am every
she had a mad grave and heart breaking air her torn blouse disclosed
as she talked she pressed her pierced hand to her breast where there
was another hole and whence there spurted from moment to moment a
stream of blood like a jet of wine from an open bung hole
marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion
oh she resumed it is coming again i am stifling
she caught up her blouse and bit it and her limbs stiffened on the
at that moment the young cocks crow executed by little gavroche
the child had mounted a table to load his gun and was singing gayly the
sauvons nous sauvons nous let us flee let us flee
eponine raised herself and listened then she murmured
my brother is here he must not see me he would scold me
your brother inquired marius who was meditating in the most bitter
and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the thenardiers which
his father had bequeathed to him who is your brother
oh dont go away said she it will not be long now
she was sitting almost upright but her voice was very low and broken by
at intervals the death rattle interrupted her she put her face as near
that of marius as possible she added with a strange expression
listen i do not wish to play you a trick i have a letter in my pocket
for you i was told to put it in the post i kept it i did not want to
have it reach you but perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we
she grasped marius hand convulsively with her pierced hand but she no
longer seemed to feel her sufferings she put marius hand in the pocket
of her blouse there in fact marius felt a paper
she made a sign of satisfaction and contentment
promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am dead i shall feel it
she dropped her head again on marius knees and her eyelids closed he
thought the poor soul had departed eponine remained motionless all
