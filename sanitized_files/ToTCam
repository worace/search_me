heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be
the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets her mind pursued
them looking for him among the condemned and then she clung closer to
her father cheering her showed a compassionate superiority to this
womans weakness which was wonderful to see no garret no shoemaking
no one hundred and five north tower now he had accomplished the task
he had set himself his promise was redeemed he had saved charles let
their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind not only because that was
the safest way of life involving the least offence to the people but
because they were not rich and charles throughout his imprisonment
had had to pay heavily for his bad food and for his guard and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners partly on this account and
partly to avoid a domestic spy they kept no servant the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate rendered them
occasional service and jerry almost wholly transferred to them by
mr lorry had become their daily retainer and had his bed there every
it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty
equality fraternity or death that on the door or doorpost of every
house the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size at a certain convenient height from the ground mr
jerry crunchers name therefore duly embellished the doorpost down
below and as the afternoon shadows deepened the owner of that name
himself appeared from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde called
in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed in the doctors little household as
in very many others the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening in small quantities and at various small
shops to avoid attracting notice and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy was the general desire
for some months past miss pross and mr cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors the former carrying the money the latter the
basket every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted they fared forth on this duty and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful although miss pross through her long
association with a french family might have known as much of their
language as of her own if she had had a mind she had no mind in that
direction consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as she was
pleased to call it than mr cruncher did so her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article and if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted to look round for that thing lay hold
of it and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded she always
made a bargain for it by holding up as a statement of its just price
one finger less than the merchant held up whatever his number might be
now mr cruncher said miss pross whose eyes were red with felicity
jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss prosss service he had worn
all his rust off long ago but nothing would file his spiky head down
theres all manner of things wanted said miss pross and we shall
have a precious time of it we want wine among the rest nice toasts
these redheads will be drinking wherever we buy it
it will be much the same to your knowledge miss i should think
retorted jerry whether they drink your health or the old uns
mr cruncher with some diffidence explained himself as meaning old
ha said miss pross it doesnt need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures they have but one and its midnight murder
hush dear pray pray be cautious cried lucie
yes yes yes ill be cautious said miss pross but i may say
among ourselves that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round going on in the
streets now ladybird never you stir from that fire till i come back
take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dont move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till you see me again
may i ask a question doctor manette before i go
i think you may take that liberty the doctor answered smiling
for gracious sake dont talk about liberty we have quite enough of
well my sweet said miss pross nodding her head emphatically the
short and the long of it is that i am a subject of his most gracious
majesty king george the third miss pross curtseyed at the name and
as such my maxim is confound their politics frustrate their knavish
tricks on him our hopes we fix god save the king
mr cruncher in an access of loyalty growlingly repeated the words
i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you though i wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice said miss pross approvingly
but the question doctor manette is there it was the good creatures
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all and to come at it in this chance manner is there any
prospect yet of our getting out of this place
i fear not yet it would be dangerous for charles yet
heigh ho hum said miss pross cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darlings golden hair in the light of the fire then we
must have patience and wait thats all we must hold up our heads and
fight low as my brother solomon used to say now mr cruncher dont
they went out leaving lucie and her husband her father and the
child by a bright fire mr lorry was expected back presently from the
banking house miss pross had lighted the lamp but had put it aside in
a corner that they might enjoy the fire light undisturbed little lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm and he
in a tone not rising much above a whisper began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prison wall and let out
a captive who had once done the fairy a service all was subdued and
quiet and lucie was more at ease than she had been
what is that she cried all at once
my dear said her father stopping in his story and laying his hand
on hers command yourself what a disordered state you are in the
least thing nothing startles you you your fathers daughter
i thought my father said lucie excusing herself with a pale face
and in a faltering voice that i heard strange feet upon the stairs
my love the staircase is as still as death
as he said the word a blow was struck upon the door
oh father father what can this be hide charles save him
my child said the doctor rising and laying his hand upon her
shoulder i have saved him what weakness is this my dear let me go
he took the lamp in his hand crossed the two intervening outer rooms
and opened it a rude clattering of feet over the floor and four rough
men in red caps armed with sabres and pistols entered the room
the citizen evremonde called darnay said the first
i seek him we seek him i know you evremonde i saw you before the
tribunal to day you are again the prisoner of the republic
the four surrounded him where he stood with his wife and child clinging
tell me how and why am i again a prisoner
it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie and will
know to morrow you are summoned for to morrow
doctor manette whom this visitation had so turned into stone that he
stood with the lamp in his hand as if he were a statue made to hold it
moved after these words were spoken put the lamp down and confronting
the speaker and taking him not ungently by the loose front of his red
you know him you have said do you know me
we all know you citizen doctor said the other three
he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower voice
will you answer his question to me then how does this happen
citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced to
the section of saint antoine this citizen pointing out the second who
the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added
citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no
more if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them the republic goes before all
the people is supreme evremonde we are pressed
one word the doctor entreated will you tell me who denounced him
it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of saint
the doctor turned his eyes upon that man who moved uneasily on his
feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said
well truly it is against rule but he is denounced and gravely by
the citizen and citizeness defarge and by one other
then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be
happily unconscious of the new calamity at home miss pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
pont neuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make mr cruncher with the basket walked at her side they
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers it
was a raw evening and the misty river blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked making guns for the army of the
republic woe to the man who played tricks with that army or got
undeserved promotion in it better for him that his beard had never
grown for the national razor shaved him close
having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of oil
for the lamp miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted
after peeping into several wine shops she stopped at the sign of the
good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the national palace
once and twice the tuileries where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy it had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed and though red with patriotic caps was
not so red as the rest sounding mr cruncher and finding him of her
opinion miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity
slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one bare breasted
bare armed soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud and of
the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid aside to be
resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep who in the
popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked in that attitude
like slumbering bears or dogs the two outlandish customers approached
as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a
corner and rose to depart in going he had to face miss pross no
sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered a scream and clapped
in a moment the whole company were on their feet that somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence everybody looked to see somebody fall but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man with all
the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican the woman
what was said in this disappointing anti climax by the disciples of the
good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something very
voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss
pross and her protector though they had been all ears but they had no
ears for anything in their surprise for it must be recorded that
not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation but
mr cruncher though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account was in a state of the greatest wonder
what is the matter said the man who had caused miss pross to scream
speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in
oh solomon dear solomon cried miss pross clapping her hands again
after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time
dont call me solomon do you want to be the death of me asked the
brother brother cried miss pross bursting into tears have i ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question
then hold your meddlesome tongue said solomon and come out if you
want to speak to me pay for your wine and come out whos this man
miss pross shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother said through her tears mr cruncher
let him come out too said solomon does he think me a ghost
apparently mr cruncher did to judge from his looks he said not a
word however and miss pross exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine as she did
so solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus
of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french
language which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
now said solomon stopping at the dark street corner what do you
how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from cried miss pross to give me such a greeting and show me no
there confound it there said solomon making a dab at miss prosss
lips with his own now are you content
miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence
if you expect me to be surprised said her brother solomon i am not
surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are here if
you really dont want to endanger my existence which i half believe you
do go your ways as soon as possible and let me go mine i am busy i
my english brother solomon mourned miss pross casting up her
tear fraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country an official among foreigners and
such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
i said so cried her brother interrupting i knew it you want to be
the death of me i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister just
the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried miss pross far
rather would i never see you again dear solomon though i have ever
loved you truly and ever shall say but one affectionate word to me
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i will
good miss pross as if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers as if mr lorry had not known it for a fact years
ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother had spent
he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case
all the world over when mr cruncher touching him on the shoulder
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is john solomon
the official turned towards him with sudden distrust he had not
come said mr cruncher speak out you know which by the way
was more than he could do himself john solomon or solomon john she
calls you solomon and she must know being your sister and i know
youre john you know which of the two goes first and regarding that
name of pross likewise that warnt your name over the water
well i dont know all i mean for i cant call to mind what your name
no but ill swear it was a name of two syllables
yes tother ones was one syllable i know you you was a spy witness
at the bailey what in the name of the father of lies own father to
thats the name for a thousand pound cried jerry
the speaker who struck in was sydney carton he had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding coat and he stood at mr crunchers
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself
dont be alarmed my dear miss pross i arrived at mr lorrys to his
surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present
myself here to beg a little talk with your brother i wish you had a
better employed brother than mr barsad i wish for your sake mr barsad
sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolers the spy
who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared
ill tell you said sydney i lighted on you mr barsad coming out
of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls
an hour or more ago you have a face to be remembered and i remember
faces well made curious by seeing you in that connection and having
a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your
direction i walked into the wine shop here close after you and
sat near you i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the
nature of your calling and gradually what i had done at random seemed
to shape itself into a purpose mr barsad
it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the
street could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your
company at the office of tellsons bank for instance
really mr barsad i cant say if you cant
do you mean that you wont say sir the spy irresolutely asked
you apprehend me very clearly mr barsad i wont
cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret mind
and with such a man as he had to do with his practised eye saw it and
now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his
sister if any trouble comes of this its your doing
come come mr barsad exclaimed sydney dont be ungrateful
but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction do you go with me to the bank
ill hear what you have got to say yes ill go with you
i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street let me take your arm miss pross this is not a good city
at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as your escort
knows mr barsad i will invite him to mr lorrys with us are we
miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life
remembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and looked up
in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only
contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man she was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection and with sydneys friendly reassurances adequately to
they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way to mr
lorrys which was within a few minutes walk john barsad or solomon
mr lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellsons who had looked
into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a good many years
ago he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with
miss prosss brother sir said sydney mr barsad
barsad repeated the old gentleman barsad i have an association
i told you you had a remarkable face mr barsad observed carton
as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that mr lorry wanted
by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial mr lorry
immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
mr barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of said sydney and has acknowledged the
relationship i pass to worse news darnay has been arrested again
struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you
tell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am about
arrested for all that when was it done mr barsad
mr barsad is the best authority possible sir said sydney and i
have it from mr barsads communication to a friend and brother sheep
over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place he left the
messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter there is no
mr lorrys business eye read in the speakers face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point confused but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was
now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead to morrow you said he
would be before the tribunal again to morrow mr barsad 
 in as good stead to morrow as to day but it may not be so i own
to you i am shaken mr lorry by doctor manettes not having had the
he may not have known of it beforehand said mr lorry
but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how
identified he is with his son in law
thats true mr lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand at his
in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes let the doctor play the winning game i
will play the losing one no mans life here is worth purchase any one
carried home by the people to day may be condemned tomorrow now the
stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend
in the conciergerie and the friend i purpose to myself to win is mr
you need have good cards sir said the spy
ill run them over ill see what i hold mr lorry you know what a
brute i am i wish youd give me a little brandy
it was put before him and he drank off a glassful drank off another
mr barsad he went on in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary of republican
committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret informer
so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
frenchman represents himself to his employers under a false name
thats a very good card mr barsad now in the employ of the republican
french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
english government the enemy of france and freedom thats an excellent
card inference clear as day in this region of suspicion that mr
barsad still in the pay of the aristocratic english government is the
spy of pitt the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom
the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find thats a card not to be beaten have you followed my
not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily
i play my ace denunciation of mr barsad to the nearest section
committee look over your hand mr barsad and see what you have dont
he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy and
drank it off he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him seeing it he
look over your hand carefully mr barsad take time
it was a poorer hand than he suspected mr barsad saw losing cards
in it that sydney carton knew nothing of thrown out of his honourable
employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there not because he was not wanted there our english reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date he knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted service in
france first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives he
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint
antoine and defarges wine shop had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning doctor manettes imprisonment
release and history as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the defarges and tried them on madame
defarge and had broken down with them signally he always remembered
with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved
he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over
again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up he knew as every one employed as
he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror a word might bring it down upon him once denounced and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash
his last chance of life besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over
you scarcely seem to like your hand said sydney with the greatest
i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to mr
lorry i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to
put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace
of which he has spoken i admit that i am a spy and that it is
considered a discreditable station though it must be filled by
somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean
i play my ace mr barsad said carton taking the answer on himself
and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes
i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to
hook mr lorry into the discussion that your respect for my sister 
i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother said sydney carton
i have thoroughly made up my mind about it
the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour
received such a check from the inscrutability of carton who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he that it faltered here and
failed him while he was at a loss carton said resuming his former air
and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i
have another good card here not yet enumerated that friend and
fellow sheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons
french you dont know him said the spy quickly
french eh repeated carton musing and not appearing to notice him
at all though he echoed his word well he may be
is i assure you said the spy though its not important
though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanical
way though its not important no its not important no yet i know
i think not i am sure not it cant be said the spy
it cant be muttered sydney carton retrospectively and idling his
glass which fortunately was a small one again cant be spoke good
no foreign cried carton striking his open hand on the table as a
light broke clearly on his mind cly disguised but the same man we
had that man before us at the old bailey
now there you are hasty sir said barsad with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really give
me an advantage over you cly who i will unreservedly admit at this
distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead several years i
attended him in his last illness he was buried in london at the church
of saint pancras in the fields his unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but i helped
here mr lorry became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall tracing it to its source he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on mr crunchers head
let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair to show you
how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is i will
lay before you a certificate of clys burial which i happened to have
carried in my pocket book with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it ever since there it is oh look at it look at it you may take
here mr lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and
mr cruncher rose and stepped forward his hair could not have been more
violently on end if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that jack built
unseen by the spy mr cruncher stood at his side and touched him on
that there roger cly master said mr cruncher with a taciturn and
iron bound visage so you put him in his coffin
barsad leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean
i mean said mr cruncher that he warnt never in it no not he
ill have my head took off if he was ever in it
the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked in
i tell you said jerry that you buried paving stones and earth in
that there coffin dont go and tell me that you buried cly it was a
take in me and two more knows it
whats that to you ecod growled mr cruncher its you i have got a
old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen
id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea
sydney carton who with mr lorry had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business here requested mr cruncher to moderate and
at another time sir he returned evasively the present time is
ill conwenient for explainin what i stand to is that he knows well
wot that there cly was never in that there coffin let him say he was
in so much as a word of one syllable and ill either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea mr cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer or ill out and announce him
humph i see one thing said carton i hold another card mr barsad
impossible here in raging paris with suspicion filling the air for
you to outlive denunciation when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself who moreover has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again
a plot in the prisons of the foreigner against the republic a strong
card a certain guillotine card do you play
no returned the spy i throw up i confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob that i only got away from england at the risk
of being ducked to death and that cly was so ferreted up and down that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham though how this
man knows it was a sham is a wonder of wonders to me
never you trouble your head about this man retorted the contentious
mr cruncher youll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman and look here once more mr cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton and said
with more decision it has come to a point i go on duty soon and
cant overstay my time you told me you had a proposal what is it
now it is of no use asking too much of me ask me to do anything in my
office putting my head in great extra danger and i had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent in short
i should make that choice you talk of desperation we are all desperate
here remember i may denounce you if i think proper and i can swear my
way through stone walls and so can others now what do you want with
not very much you are a turnkey at the conciergerie
i tell you once for all there is no such thing as an escape possible
why need you tell me what i have not asked you are a turnkey at the
i can pass in and out when i choose
sydney carton filled another glass with brandy poured it slowly out
upon the hearth and watched it as it dropped it being all spent he
so far we have spoken before these two because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me come
into the dark room here and let us have one final word alone
while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room speaking so low that not a sound was heard mr lorry looked
at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust that honest tradesmans
manner of receiving the look did not inspire confidence he changed the
leg on which he rested as often as if he had fifty of those limbs
and were trying them all he examined his finger nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention and whenever mr lorrys eye caught
his he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it which is seldom if ever known to be an
mr cruncher came forward sideways with one of his shoulders in advance
after some cogitation accompanied with an intent look at his patron
mr cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying agicultooral
my mind misgives me much said mr lorry angrily shaking a forefinger
at him that you have used the respectable and great house of tellsons
as a blind and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description if you have dont expect me to befriend you when you
get back to england if you have dont expect me to keep your secret
i hope sir pleaded the abashed mr cruncher that a gentleman like
yourself wot ive had the honour of odd jobbing till im grey at it
would think twice about harming of me even if it wos so i dont say it
is but even if it wos and which it is to be took into account that if
it wos it wouldnt even then be all o one side thered be two sides
to it there might be medical doctors at the present hour a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman dont pick up his
fardens fardens no nor yet his half fardens half fardens no nor
yet his quarter a banking away like smoke at tellsons and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly a going in and going
out to their own carriages ah equally like smoke if not more so
well that ud be imposing too on tellsons for you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander and heres mrs cruncher or leastways wos
in the old england times and would be to morrow if cause given
a floppin again the business to that degree as is ruinating stark
ruinating whereas them medical doctors wives dont flop catch em at
it or if they flop their floppings goes in favour of more patients
and how can you rightly have one without tother then wot with
undertakers and wot with parish clerks and wot with sextons and wot
with private watchmen all awaricious and all in it a man wouldnt get
much by it even if it wos so and wot little a man did get would never
prosper with him mr lorry hed never have no good of it hed want
all along to be out of the line if he could see his way out being
ugh cried mr lorry rather relenting nevertheless i am shocked at
now what i would humbly offer to you sir pursued mr cruncher
even if it wos so which i dont say it is 
no i will not sir returned mr crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice which i dont say it is wot i
would humbly offer to you sir would be this upon that there stool at
that there bar sets that there boy of mine brought up and growed up to

that mr lorry said mr cruncher wiping his forehead with his
arm as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse is wot i would respectfully offer to you sir a man dont
see all this here a goin on dreadful round him in the way of subjects
without heads dear me plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that without havin his serious thoughts of
things and these here would be mine if it wos so entreatin of you
fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now i up and said in the good
cause when i might have kep it back
that at least is true said mr lorry say no more now it may be
that i shall yet stand your friend if you deserve it and repent in
action not in words i want no more words
mr cruncher knuckled his forehead as sydney carton and the spy
returned from the dark room adieu mr barsad said the former our
arrangement thus made you have nothing to fear from me
he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against mr lorry when they
were alone mr lorry asked him what he had done
not much if it should go ill with the prisoner i have ensured access
it is all i could do said carton to propose too much would be
to put this mans head under the axe and as he himself said nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced it was obviously the
weakness of the position there is no help for it
but access to him said mr lorry if it should go ill before the
mr lorrys eyes gradually sought the fire his sympathy with his
darling and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest gradually
weakened them he was an old man now overborne with anxiety of late
you are a good man and a true friend said carton in an altered
voice forgive me if i notice that you are affected i could not see my
father weep and sit by careless and i could not respect your
sorrow more if you were my father you are free from that misfortune
though he said the last words with a slip into his usual manner there
was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch
that mr lorry who had never seen the better side of him was wholly
unprepared for he gave him his hand and carton gently pressed it
to return to poor darnay said carton dont tell her of this
interview or this arrangement it would not enable her to go to see
him she might think it was contrived in case of the worse to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence
mr lorry had not thought of that and he looked quickly at carton to
see if it were in his mind it seemed to be he returned the look and
she might think a thousand things carton said and any of them would
only add to her trouble dont speak of me to her as i said to you when
i first came i had better not see her i can put my hand out to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do without that
you are going to her i hope she must be very desolate to night
i am glad of that she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
it was a long grieving sound like a sigh almost like a sob it
attracted mr lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to the
fire a light or a shade the old gentleman could not have said which
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill side on a
wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs which was tumbling forward he wore the white riding coat
and top boots then in vogue and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale with his long brown hair
all untrimmed hanging loose about him his indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr lorry
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log when it had
mr lorrys eyes were again attracted to his face taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features and having
the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he was strongly
and your duties here have drawn to an end sir said carton turning
yes as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so
unexpectedly i have at length done all that i can do here i hoped to
have left them in perfect safety and then to have quitted paris i have
my leave to pass i was ready to go
yours is a long life to look back upon sir said carton wistfully
you have been useful all your life steadily and constantly occupied
i have been a man of business ever since i have been a man indeed i
may say that i was a man of business when a boy
see what a place you fill at seventy eight how many people will miss
a solitary old bachelor answered mr lorry shaking his head there
how can you say that wouldnt she weep for you wouldnt her child
yes yes thank god i didnt quite mean what i said
it is a thing to thank god for is it not
if you could say with truth to your own solitary heart to night
i have secured to myself the love and attachment the gratitude or
respect of no human creature i have won myself a tender place in no
regard i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by
your seventy eight years would be seventy eight heavy curses would they
you say truly mr carton i think they would be
sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire and after a silence of a
