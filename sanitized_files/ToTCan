i should like to ask you does your childhood seem far off do the
days when you sat at your mothers knee seem days of very long ago
responding to his softened manner mr lorry answered
twenty years back yes at this time of my life no for as i draw
closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and
nearer to the beginning it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way my heart is touched now by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep of my pretty young mother and i so old
and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not
so real with me and my faults were not confirmed in me
i understand the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright flush and
carton terminated the conversation here by rising to help him on with
his outer coat but you said mr lorry reverting to the theme you
yes said carton i am not old but my young way was never the way to
and of me i am sure said mr lorry are you going out
ill walk with you to her gate you know my vagabond and restless
habits if i should prowl about the streets a long time dont be
uneasy i shall reappear in the morning you go to the court to morrow
i shall be there but only as one of the crowd my spy will find a
mr lorry did so and they went down stairs and out in the streets a
few minutes brought them to mr lorrys destination carton left him
there but lingered at a little distance and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut and touched it he had heard of her going to
the prison every day she came out here he said looking about him
turned this way must have trod on these stones often let me follow in
it was ten oclock at night when he stood before the prison of la force
where she had stood hundreds of times a little wood sawyer having
closed his shop was smoking his pipe at his shop door
good night citizen said sydney carton pausing in going by for the
you mean the guillotine not ill sixty three to day we shall mount
to a hundred soon samson and his men complain sometimes of being
exhausted ha ha ha he is so droll that samson such a barber
shave always every day what a barber you have seen him at work
go and see him when he has a good batch figure this to yourself
citizen he shaved the sixty three to day in less than two pipes less
as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to explain
how he timed the executioner carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him that he turned away
but you are not english said the wood sawyer though you wear
yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder
but go and see that droll dog the little man persisted calling after
sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper then traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well several dark and dirty streets much dirtier than usual
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror he stopped at a chemists shop which the owner was closing with
his own hands a small dim crooked shop kept in a tortuous up hill
giving this citizen too good night as he confronted him at his
counter he laid the scrap of paper before him whew the chemist
whistled softly as he read it hi hi hi
sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said
you will be careful to keep them separate citizen you know the
certain small packets were made and given to him he put them one by
one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money for them
and deliberately left the shop there is nothing more to do said he
glancing upward at the moon until to morrow i cant sleep
it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast sailing clouds nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance it was the settled manner of a tired man who
had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck into
long ago when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise he had followed his father to the grave his
mother had died years before these solemn words which had been
read at his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty three who had been that day put to death
and for to morrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons
and still of to morrows and to morrows the chain of association that
brought the words home like a rusty old ships anchor from the deep
might have been easily found he did not seek it but repeated them and
with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them in the towers of the churches where no prayers
were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self destruction from years of priestly impostors plunderers and
profligates in the distant burial places reserved as they wrote upon
the gates for eternal sleep in the abounding gaols and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the guillotine with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury sydney carton crossed the seine again for
few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps and put on heavy
shoes and trudged but the theatres were all well filled and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed and went chatting home at
one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with a mother looking
for a way across the street through the mud he carried the child over
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss
i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth
in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and
now that the streets were quiet and the night wore on the words
were in the echoes of his feet and were in the air perfectly calm
and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked but he
the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river walls of the island of paris where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead face out of the
sky then the night with the moon and the stars turned pale and died
and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to
but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that burden
of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays
and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun while the river
the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like a congenial
friend in the morning stillness he walked by the stream far from the
houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank when he awoke and was afoot again he lingered there yet a little
longer watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless until the
stream absorbed it and carried it on to the sea like me
a trading boat with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf then
glided into his view floated by him and died away as its silent track
in the water disappeared the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors
ended in the words i am the resurrection and the life
mr lorry was already out when he got back and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone sydney carton drank nothing but a
little coffee ate some bread and having washed and changed to refresh
himself went out to the place of trial
the court was all astir and a buzz when the black sheep whom many fell
away from in dread pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd
mr lorry was there and doctor manette was there she was there
when her husband was brought in she turned a look upon him so
sustaining so encouraging so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness yet so courageous for his sake that it called the healthy
blood into his face brightened his glance and animated his heart if
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look on sydney
carton it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly
before that unjust tribunal there was little or no order of procedure
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing there could have
been no such revolution if all laws forms and ceremonies had not
first been so monstrously abused that the suicidal vengeance of the
revolution was to scatter them all to the winds
every eye was turned to the jury the same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before and to morrow and the day
after eager and prominent among them one man with a craving face and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators a life thirsting
cannibal looking bloody minded juryman the jacques three of st
antoine the whole jury as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer
every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor
no favourable leaning in that quarter to day a fell uncompromising
murderous business meaning there every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd and gleamed at it approvingly and heads nodded at one
another before bending forward with a strained attention
charles evremonde called darnay released yesterday reaccused and
retaken yesterday indictment delivered to him last night suspected and
denounced enemy of the republic aristocrat one of a family of tyrants
one of a race proscribed for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people charles evremonde
called darnay in right of such proscription absolutely dead in law
to this effect in as few or fewer words the public prosecutor
the president asked was the accused openly denounced or secretly
three voices ernest defarge wine vendor of st antoine
a great uproar took place in the court and in the midst of it doctor
manette was seen pale and trembling standing where he had been seated
president i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter my
daughter and those dear to her are far dearer to me than my life who
and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband
citizen manette be tranquil to fail in submission to the authority of
the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law as to what is dearer
to you than life nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
loud acclamations hailed this rebuke the president rang his bell and
if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself you would have no duty but to sacrifice her listen to what is
frantic acclamations were again raised doctor manette sat down with
his eyes looking around and his lips trembling his daughter drew
closer to him the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together
and restored the usual hand to his mouth
defarge was produced when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment and of
his having been a mere boy in the doctors service and of the release
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him
this short examination followed for the court was quick with its work
you did good service at the taking of the bastille citizen
here an excited woman screeched from the crowd you were one of the
best patriots there why not say so you were a cannonier that day
there and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it was the vengeance who amidst the warm commendations of the audience
thus assisted the proceedings the president rang his bell but the
vengeance warming with encouragement shrieked i defy that bell
inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille
i knew said defarge looking down at his wife who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised looking steadily up at him
i knew that this prisoner of whom i speak had been confined in a cell
known as one hundred and five north tower i knew it from himself he
knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five north tower
when he made shoes under my care as i serve my gun that day i resolve
when the place shall fall to examine that cell it falls i mount to
the cell with a fellow citizen who is one of the jury directed by a
gaoler i examine it very closely in a hole in the chimney where a
stone has been worked out and replaced i find a written paper this is
that written paper i have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of doctor manette this is the writing of doctor manette
i confide this paper in the writing of doctor manette to the hands of
in a dead silence and stillness the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife and all the other eyes there
intent upon the doctor who saw none of them the paper was read as
i alexandre manette unfortunate physician native of beauvais and
afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the bastille during the last month of the year 1767 i write
it at stolen intervals under every difficulty i design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it some pitying hand may find it there when i
these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney mixed
with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity hope
has quite departed from my breast i know from terrible warnings i have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired but i
solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right
mind that my memory is exact and circumstantial and that i write the
truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words whether they
be ever read by men or not at the eternal judgment seat
one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december i think the
twenty second of the month in the year 1757 i was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air
at an hours distance from my place of residence in the street of the
school of medicine when a carriage came along behind me driven very
fast as i stood aside to let that carriage pass apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down a head was put out at the window and a
the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses
and the same voice called to me by my name i answered the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before i came up with it
i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared to
conceal themselves as they stood side by side near the carriage door
i also observed that they both looked of about my own age or rather
younger and that they were greatly alike in stature manner voice
and as far as i could see face too
doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other the young
physician originally an expert surgeon who within the last year or two
gentlemen i returned i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so
we have been to your residence said the first and not being
so fortunate as to find you there and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction we followed in the hope of
overtaking you will you please to enter the carriage
the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as these words
were spoken so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door
gentlemen said i pardon me but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of the case to
the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second doctor
your clients are people of condition as to the nature of the case
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it enough will you please to
i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence they both
entered after me the last springing in after putting up the steps the
carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed
i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred i have no doubt that
it is word for word the same i describe everything exactly as it took
place constraining my mind not to wander from the task where i make
the broken marks that follow here i leave off for the time and put my
the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier and
emerged upon the country road at two thirds of a league from the
barrier i did not estimate the distance at that time but afterwards
when i traversed it it struck out of the main avenue and presently
stopped at a solitary house we all three alighted and walked by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed to the door of the house it was not opened immediately in
answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it with his heavy riding glove across the face
there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs but the
other of the two being angry likewise struck the man in like manner
with his arm the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers
from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found
locked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us and had
relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber i was
conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain
the patient was a woman of great beauty and young assuredly not much
past twenty her hair was torn and ragged and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs i noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentlemans dress on one of them which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw the armorial bearings of a noble
i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient
for in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth and was
in danger of suffocation my first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing and in moving the scarf aside the embroidery in the
i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down and looked into her face her eyes were dilated and
wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeated the
words my husband my father and my brother and then counted up to
twelve and said hush for an instant and no more she would pause
to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin again and she
would repeat the cry my husband my father and my brother and
would count up to twelve and say hush there was no variation in the
order or the manner there was no cessation but the regular moments
to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and the
younger by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority it
was the elder who replied since about this hour last night
she has a husband a father and a brother
she has some recent association with the number twelve
the younger brother impatiently rejoined with twelve oclock
see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breast how
useless i am as you have brought me if i had known what i was coming
to see i could have come provided as it is time must be lost there
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place
the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily there is
a case of medicines here and brought it from a closet and put it on
i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers to my
lips if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves i would not have administered any of those
do you doubt them asked the younger brother
you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said no
i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after many
efforts the dose that i desired to give as i intended to repeat it
after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then
sat down by the side of the bed there was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance wife of the man down stairs who had retreated into
a corner the house was damp and decayed indifferently
furnished evidently recently occupied and temporarily used some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deaden the
sound of the shrieks they continued to be uttered in their regular
succession with the cry my husband my father and my brother the
counting up to twelve and hush the frenzy was so violent that i had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms but i had looked to
them to see that they were not painful the only spark of encouragement
in the case was that my hand upon the sufferers breast had this much
soothing influence that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure it had no effect upon the cries no pendulum could be more
for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers looking on
i was startled and asked is it a pressing case
you had better see he carelessly answered and took up a light
the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase which
was a species of loft over a stable there was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it the rest was open to the ridge of the tiled roof and
there were beams across hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place fagots for firing and a heap of apples in sand i had to
pass through that part to get at the other my memory is circumstantial
and unshaken i try it with these details and i see them all in
this my cell in the bastille near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity as i saw them all that night
on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his head lay a
handsome peasant boy a boy of not more than seventeen at the most
he lay on his back with his teeth set his right hand clenched on his
breast and his glaring eyes looking straight upward i could not see
where his wound was as i kneeled on one knee over him but i could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point
i am a doctor my poor fellow said i let me examine it
i do not want it examined he answered let it be
it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his hand away
the wound was a sword thrust received from twenty to twenty four hours
before but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay he was then dying fast as i turned my eyes to the elder
brother i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out as if he were a wounded bird or hare or rabbit not at all
how has this been done monsieur said i
a crazed young common dog a serf forced my brother to draw upon him
and has fallen by my brothers sword like a gentleman
there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in this
answer the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and they now
doctor they are very proud these nobles but we common dogs are
proud too sometimes they plunder us outrage us beat us kill us but
we have a little pride left sometimes she have you seen her doctor
the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by the
distance he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence
she is my sister doctor they have had their shameful rights these
nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many years but we
have had good girls among us i know it and have heard my father say
so she was a good girl she was betrothed to a good young man too a
tenant of his we were all tenants of his that mans who stands there
the other is his brother the worst of a bad race
it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis
we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we common dogs
are by those superior beings taxed by him without mercy obliged to
work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his mill obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat we
ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closed that his
people should not see it and take it from us i say we were so robbed
and hunted and were made so poor that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world and that what we should
most pray for was that our women might be barren and our miserable
i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed bursting forth
like a fire i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in the
nevertheless doctor my sister married he was ailing at that time
poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage our dog hut as that man would call it she had not
been married many weeks when that mans brother saw her and admired
her and asked that man to lend her to him for what are husbands among
us he was willing enough but my sister was good and virtuous and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine what did the two
then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her
the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned to the
looker on and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true the two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can see even in this
bastille the gentlemans all negligent indifference the peasants all
you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts and drive us they so harnessed him and
drove him you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their
grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night and ordered him back into his harness in the day but he was
not persuaded no taken out of harness one day at noon to feed if he
could find food he sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the
nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong he forced back the gathering shadows of death as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and to cover his
then with that mans permission and even with his aid his
brother took her away in spite of what i know she must have told his
brother and what that is will not be long unknown to you doctor if
it is now his brother took her away for his pleasure and diversion
for a little while i saw her pass me on the road when i took the
tidings home our fathers heart burst he never spoke one of the words
that filled it i took my young sister for i have another to a place
beyond the reach of this man and where at least she will never be
his vassal then i tracked the brother here and last night climbed
in a common dog but sword in hand where is the loft window it was
the room was darkening to his sight the world was narrowing around
him i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor as if there had been a struggle
she heard me and ran in i told her not to come near us till he was
dead he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money then struck
at me with a whip but i though a common dog so struck at him as to
make him draw let him break into as many pieces as he will the sword
that he stained with my common blood he drew to defend himself thrust
at me with all his skill for his life
my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments of
a broken sword lying among the hay that weapon was a gentlemans in
another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers
now lift me up doctor lift me up where is he
he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking that he
he proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me where is the
man who was here turn my face to him
i did so raising the boys head against my knee but invested for the
moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completely obliging
me to rise too or i could not have still supported him
marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wide and
his right hand raised in the days when all these things are to be
answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad race to
answer for them i mark this cross of blood upon you as a sign that
i do it in the days when all these things are to be answered for
i summon your brother the worst of the bad race to answer for them
separately i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that i do
twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him
when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity i knew that this might last
for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the
i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced she never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words they were always my husband my father and my brother
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
this lasted twenty six hours from the time when i first saw her i had
come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when she began to
falter i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity and
by and bye she sank into a lethargy and lay like the dead
it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long and
fearful storm i released her arms and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn it was then that i knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen and it was then that i lost the little hope i had
is she dead asked the marquis whom i will still describe as the
elder brother coming booted into the room from his horse
not dead said i but like to die
what strength there is in these common bodies he said looking down
there is prodigious strength i answered him in sorrow and
he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and said in a
doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds i
recommended that your aid should be invited your reputation is high
and as a young man with your fortune to make you are probably mindful
of your interest the things that you see here are things to be seen
i listened to the patients breathing and avoided answering
do you honour me with your attention doctor
monsieur said i in my profession the communications of patients
are always received in confidence i was guarded in my answer for i
was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen
her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried the
pulse and the heart there was life and no more looking round as i
resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me
i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness that i must abridge this narrative there is no confusion or
failure in my memory it can recall and could detail every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers
she lingered for a week towards the last i could understand some few
syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to her lips she
asked me where she was and i told her who i was and i told her it
was in vain that i asked her for her family name she faintly shook her
head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done
i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had told the
brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another day until
then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there but when it came to
that they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her as
if the thought passed through my mind i were dying too
i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant and that
peasant a boy the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family and was ridiculous as often as i caught the younger
brothers eyes their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply
for knowing what i knew from the boy he was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder but i saw this i also saw that i was an incumbrance
my patient died two hours before midnight at a time by my watch
answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her i was alone
with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side and
the brothers were waiting in a room down stairs impatient to ride
away i had heard them alone at the bedside striking their boots with
their riding whips and loitering up and down
at last she is dead said the elder when i went in
i congratulate you my brother were his words as he turned round
he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking he now
gave me a rouleau of gold i took it from his hand but laid it on
the table i had considered the question and had resolved to accept
pray excuse me said i under the circumstances no
they exchanged looks but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to
them and we parted without another word on either side
i am weary weary weary worn down by misery i cannot read what i
early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box with my name on the outside from the first i had anxiously
considered what i ought to do i decided that day to write privately
to the minister stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been
summoned and the place to which i had gone in effect stating all the
circumstances i knew what court influence was and what the immunities
of the nobles were and i expected that the matter would never be
heard of but i wished to relieve my own mind i had kept the matter a
profound secret even from my wife and this too i resolved to state
in my letter i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger but
i was conscious that there might be danger for others if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed
i was much engaged that day and could not complete my letter that
night i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it
it was the last day of the year the letter was lying before me just
completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished to see me
i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself it is
so cold so dark my senses are so benumbed and the gloom upon me is so
the lady was young engaging and handsome but not marked for long
life she was in great agitation she presented herself to me as the
wife of the marquis st evremonde i connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i
my memory is still accurate but i cannot write the words of our
conversation i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was and i
know not at what times i may be watched she had in part suspected and
in part discovered the main facts of the cruel story of her husbands
share in it and my being resorted to she did not know that the girl
was dead her hope had been she said in great distress to show her
in secret a womans sympathy her hope had been to avert the wrath of
heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many
she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living and
her greatest desire was to help that sister i could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothing her
inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been the hope
that i could tell her the name and place of abode whereas to this
these scraps of paper fail me one was taken from me with a warning
yesterday i must finish my record to day
she was a good compassionate lady and not happy in her marriage how
could she be the brother distrusted and disliked her and his influence
was all opposed to her she stood in dread of him and in dread of her
husband too when i handed her down to the door there was a child a
pretty boy from two to three years old in her carriage
for his sake doctor she said pointing to him in tears i would do
all i can to make what poor amends i can he will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise i have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this it will one day be required of him what
i have left to call my own it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels i will make it the first charge of his life to bestow with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother on this injured family if
she kissed the boy and said caressing him it is for thine own dear
sake thou wilt be faithful little charles the child answered her
bravely yes i kissed her hand and she took him in her arms and
went away caressing him i never saw her more
as she had mentioned her husbands name in the faith that i knew it
i added no mention of it to my letter i sealed my letter and not
trusting it out of my own hands delivered it myself that day
that night the last night of the year towards nine oclock a man in
a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softly followed
my servant ernest defarge a youth up stairs when my servant came
into the room where i sat with my wife o my wife beloved of my heart
my fair young english wife we saw the man who was supposed to be at
an urgent case in the rue st honore he said it would not detain me
it brought me here it brought me to my grave when i was clear of the
house a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind and
my arms were pinioned the two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner and identified me with a single gesture the marquis took from
his pocket the letter i had written showed it me burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held and extinguished the ashes with his foot
not a word was spoken i was brought here i was brought to my living
if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers in all these frightful years to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them but
now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them and that
they have no part in his mercies and them and their descendants to the
last of their race i alexandre manette unhappy prisoner do this last
night of the year 1767 in my unbearable agony denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for i denounce them to heaven
a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done a
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it
little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to show
how the defarges had not made the paper public with the other captured
bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept it biding their
time little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by saint antoine and was wrought into the fatal register
the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day against such denunciation
and all the worse for the doomed man that the denouncer was a
well known citizen his own attached friend the father of his wife one
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity and for sacrifices and
self immolations on the peoples altar therefore when the president
said else had his own head quivered on his shoulders that the good
physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan there was wild excitement patriotic fervour not a touch of
much influence around him has that doctor murmured madame defarge
smiling to the vengeance save him now my doctor save him
at every jurymans vote there was a roar another and another roar and
unanimously voted at heart and by descent an aristocrat an enemy
of the republic a notorious oppressor of the people back to the
conciergerie and death within four and twenty hours
the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die fell under
the sentence as if she had been mortally stricken but she uttered no
sound and so strong was the voice within her representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it that it quickly raised her even from that shock
the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors
the tribunal adjourned the quick noise and movement of the courts
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased when lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband with nothing in her face
if i might touch him if i might embrace him once o good citizens if
you would have so much compassion for us
there was but a gaoler left along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night and barsad the people had all poured out to the
show in the streets barsad proposed to the rest let her embrace
him then it is but a moment it was silently acquiesced in and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place where he by
leaning over the dock could fold her in his arms
farewell dear darling of my soul my parting blessing on my love we
shall meet again where the weary are at rest
they were her husbands words as he held her to his bosom
i can bear it dear charles i am supported from above dont suffer
