an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an
event quite out of the ordinary course a man who was a stranger in the
department and who bore the name of m madeleine had thanks to the
new methods resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry the
manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets he had made his fortune
in the business and that of the arrondissement as well we will admit
he had been appointed mayor in recognition of his services the police
discovered that m madeleine was no other than an ex convict who had
broken his ban condemned in 1796 for theft and named jean valjean
jean valjean has been recommitted to prison it appears that previous
to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m
laffitte a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there and
which he had moreover and by perfectly legitimate means acquired in
his business no one has been able to discover where jean valjean has
concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon
the second article which enters a little more into detail is an
extract from the journal de paris of the same date
a former convict who had been liberated named jean valjean has just
appeared before the court of assizes of the var under circumstances
calculated to attract attention this wretch had succeeded in escaping
the vigilance of the police he had changed his name and had succeeded
in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns
in this town he had established a considerable commerce he has at last
been unmasked and arrested thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the
public prosecutor he had for his concubine a woman of the town who
died of a shock at the moment of his arrest this scoundrel who is
endowed with herculean strength found means to escape but three or
four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more
in paris itself at the very moment when he was entering one of those
little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of
montfermeil seine et oise he is said to have profited by this
interval of three or four days of liberty to withdraw a considerable
sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers this sum has been
estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs if the indictment is
to be trusted he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone
and it has not been possible to lay hands on it however that may be
the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the
department of the var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with
violence about eight years ago on the person of one of those honest
children who as the patriarch of ferney has said in immortal verse
this bandit refused to defend himself it was proved by the skilful and
eloquent representative of the public prosecutor that the theft was
committed in complicity with others and that jean valjean was a member
of a band of robbers in the south jean valjean was pronounced guilty
and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence this criminal
refused to lodge an appeal the king in his inexhaustible clemency has
deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life jean
valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon
the reader has not forgotten that jean valjean had religious habits at
m sur m some papers among others the constitutional presented this
commutation as a triumph of the priestly party
jean valjean changed his number in the galleys he was called 9430
however and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be
obliged to recur to the subject the prosperity of m sur m vanished
with m madeleine all that he had foreseen during his night of fever
and hesitation was realized lacking him there actually was a soul
lacking after this fall there took place at m sur m that egotistical
division of great existences which have fallen that fatal dismemberment
of flourishing things which is accomplished every day obscurely in
the human community and which history has noted only once because it
occurred after the death of alexander lieutenants are crowned kings
rivalries arose m madeleines vast workshops were shut his buildings
fell to ruin his workmen were scattered some of them quitted the
country others abandoned the trade thenceforth everything was done
on a small scale instead of on a grand scale for lucre instead of
the general good there was no longer a centre everywhere there
was competition and animosity m madeleine had reigned over all and
directed all no sooner had he fallen than each pulled things to
himself the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization
bitterness to cordiality hatred of one another to the benevolence of
the founder towards all the threads which m madeleine had set were
tangled and broken the methods were adulterated the products were
debased confidence was killed the market diminished for lack of
orders salaries were reduced the workshops stood still bankruptcy
arrived and then there was nothing more for the poor all had vanished
the state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere
less than four years after the judgment of the court of assizes
establishing the identity of jean valjean and m madeleine for the
benefit of the galleys the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the
arrondissement of m sur m and m de villele called attention to the
fact in the rostrum in the month of february 1827
chapter ii in which the reader will peruse two verses which are of the
before proceeding further it will be to the purpose to narrate in some
detail a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch
in montfermeil and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain
there exists in the region of montfermeil a very ancient superstition
which is all the more curious and all the more precious because
a popular superstition in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in
siberia we are among those who respect everything which is in the
nature of a rare plant here then is the superstition of montfermeil
it is thought that the devil from time immemorial has selected the
forest as a hiding place for his treasures goodwives affirm that it is
no rarity to encounter at nightfall in secluded nooks of the forest
a black man with the air of a carter or a wood chopper wearing wooden
shoes clad in trousers and a blouse of linen and recognizable by the
fact that instead of a cap or hat he has two immense horns on his
head this ought in fact to render him recognizable this man is
habitually engaged in digging a hole there are three ways of profiting
by such an encounter the first is to approach the man and speak to him
then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant that he appears black
because it is nightfall that he is not digging any hole whatever but
is cutting grass for his cows and that what had been taken for horns
is nothing but a dung fork which he is carrying on his back and whose
teeth thanks to the perspective of evening seemed to spring from his
head the man returns home and dies within the week the second way is
to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has filled it
and has gone away then to run with great speed to the trench to
open it once more and to seize the treasure which the black man
has necessarily placed there in this case one dies within the month
finally the last method is not to speak to the black man not to look
at him and to flee at the best speed of ones legs one then dies
as all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences the
second which at all events presents some advantages among others that
of possessing a treasure if only for a month is the one most generally
adopted so bold men who are tempted by every chance have quite
frequently as we are assured opened the holes excavated by the black
man and tried to rob the devil the success of the operation appears
to be but moderate at least if the tradition is to be believed and in
particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous latin which an
evil norman monk a bit of a sorcerer named tryphon has left on
this subject this tryphon is buried at the abbey of saint georges de
bocherville near rouen and toads spawn on his grave
accordingly enormous efforts are made such trenches are ordinarily
extremely deep a man sweats digs toils all night for it must be done
at night he wets his shirt burns out his candle breaks his mattock
and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole when he lays his hand on
the treasure what does he find what is the devils treasure a sou
sometimes a crown piece a stone a skeleton a bleeding body sometimes
a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio
sometimes nothing this is what tryphons verses seem to announce to the
it seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder horn with
bullets sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn which has
evidently served the devil tryphon does not record these two finds
since tryphon lived in the twelfth century and since the devil does not
appear to have had the wit to invent powder before roger bacons time
and cards before the time of charles vi
moreover if one plays at cards one is sure to lose all that one
possesses and as for the powder in the horn it possesses the property
of making your gun burst in your face
now a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting
attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of
several days had been prowling around montfermeil it was remarked in
that village that a certain old road laborer named boulatruelle had
peculiar ways in the forest people thereabouts thought they knew that
this boulatruelle had been in the galleys he was subjected to
certain police supervision and as he could find work nowhere the
administration employed him at reduced rates as a road mender on the
this boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the
inhabitants of the district as too respectful too humble too prompt in
removing his cap to every one and trembling and smiling in the presence
of the gendarmes probably affiliated to robber bands they said
suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall the only
thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard
this is what people thought they had noticed
of late boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking
and care of the road at a very early hour and to betaking himself to
the forest with his pickaxe he was encountered towards evening in
the most deserted clearings in the wildest thickets and he had the
appearance of being in search of something and sometimes he was digging
holes the goodwives who passed took him at first for beelzebub then
they recognized boulatruelle and were not in the least reassured
thereby these encounters seemed to cause boulatruelle a lively
displeasure it was evident that he sought to hide and that there was
it was said in the village it is clear that the devil has appeared
boulatruelle has seen him and is on the search in sooth he is cunning
the voltairians added will boulatruelle catch the devil or will the
devil catch boulatruelle the old women made a great many signs of the
in the meantime boulatruelles manoeuvres in the forest ceased and he
resumed his regular occupation of roadmending and people gossiped of
some persons however were still curious surmising that in all this
there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends but some
fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devils
bank bills and that the road mender had half discovered the secret the
most puzzled were the school master and thenardier the proprietor of
the tavern who was everybodys friend and had not disdained to ally
he has been in the galleys said thenardier eh good god no one
knows who has been there or will be there
one evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would
have instituted an inquiry as to what boulatruelle did in the forest
and that the latter would have been forced to speak and that he would
have been put to the torture in case of need and that boulatruelle
would not have resisted the water test for example let us put him to
they made an effort and got the old road mender to drinking
boulatruelle drank an enormous amount but said very little he combined
with admirable art and in masterly proportions the thirst of a
gormandizer with the discretion of a judge nevertheless by dint of
returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few
obscure words which he did allow to escape him this is what thenardier
and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out
one morning when boulatruelle was on his way to his work at daybreak
he had been surprised to see at a nook of the forest in the underbrush
a shovel and a pickaxe concealed as one might say
however he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and
pick of father six fours the water carrier and would have thought no
more about it but on the evening of that day he saw without being
seen himself as he was hidden by a large tree a person who did not
belong in those parts and whom he boulatruelle knew well directing
his steps towards the densest part of the wood translation by
thenardier a comrade of the galleys boulatruelle obstinately refused
to reveal his name this person carried a package something square
like a large box or a small trunk surprise on the part of boulatruelle
however it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that
the idea of following that person had occurred to him but it was too
late the person was already in the thicket night had descended and
boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him then he had
adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods it was
moonlight two or three hours later boulatruelle had seen this person
emerge from the brushwood carrying no longer the coffer but a shovel
and pick boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass and had not
dreamed of accosting him because he said to himself that the other man
was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and that
he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him and on
perceiving that he was recognized touching effusion of two old comrades
on meeting again but the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light
to boulatruelle he had hastened to the thicket in the morning and had
found neither shovel nor pick from this he had drawn the inference that
this person once in the forest had dug a hole with his pick buried
the coffer and reclosed the hole with his shovel now the coffer was
too small to contain a body therefore it contained money hence his
researches boulatruelle had explored sounded searched the entire
forest and the thicket and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him
to have been recently turned up in vain
he had ferreted out nothing no one in montfermeil thought any more
about it there were only a few brave gossips who said you may be
certain that the mender on the gagny road did not take all that trouble
for nothing he was sure that the devil had come
chapter iii the ankle chain must have undergone a certain preparatory
manipulation to be thus broken with a blow from a hammer
towards the end of october in that same year 1823 the inhabitants of
toulon beheld the entry into their port after heavy weather and for
the purpose of repairing some damages of the ship orion which was
employed later at brest as a school ship and which then formed a part
this vessel battered as it was for the sea had handled it
roughly produced a fine effect as it entered the roads it flew some
colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns which
it returned shot for shot total twenty two it has been calculated
that what with salvos royal and military politenesses courteous
exchanges of uproar signals of etiquette formalities of roadsteads and
citadels sunrises and sunsets saluted every day by all fortresses and
all ships of war openings and closings of ports etc the civilized
world discharged all over the earth in the course of four and twenty
hours one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots at six francs the
shot that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day three hundred
millions a year which vanish in smoke this is a mere detail all this
the year 1823 was what the restoration called the epoch of the spanish
this war contained many events in one and a quantity of peculiarities
a grand family affair for the house of bourbon the branch of france
succoring and protecting the branch of madrid that is to say
performing an act devolving on the elder an apparent return to our
national traditions complicated by servitude and by subjection to the
cabinets of the north m le duc dangouleme surnamed by the liberal
sheets the hero of andujar compressing in a triumphal attitude that
was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air the ancient and very
powerful terrorism of the holy office at variance with the chimerical
terrorism of the liberals the sansculottes resuscitated to the great
terror of dowagers under the name of descamisados monarchy opposing an
obstacle to progress described as anarchy the theories of 89 roughly
interrupted in the sap a european halt called to the french idea
which was making the tour of the world beside the son of france as
generalissimo the prince de carignan afterwards charles albert
enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a
volunteer with grenadier epaulets of red worsted the soldiers of the
empire setting out on a fresh campaign but aged saddened after eight
years of repose and under the white cockade the tricolored standard
waved abroad by a heroic handful of frenchmen as the white standard had
been thirty years earlier at coblentz monks mingled with our troops
the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets
principles slaughtered by cannonades france undoing by her arms that
which she had done by her mind in addition to this hostile leaders
sold soldiers hesitating cities besieged by millions no military
perils and yet possible explosions as in every mine which is surprised
and invaded but little bloodshed little honor won shame for some
glory for no one such was this war made by the princes descended from
louis xiv and conducted by generals who had been under napoleon its
sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics
some feats of arms were serious the taking of the trocadero among
others was a fine military action but after all we repeat the
trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound the whole effect was
suspicious history approves of france for making a difficulty about
accepting this false triumph it seemed evident that certain spanish
officers charged with resistance yielded too easily the idea of
corruption was connected with the victory it appears as though generals
and not battles had been won and the conquering soldier returned
humiliated a debasing war in short in which the bank of france could
be read in the folds of the flag
soldiers of the war of 1808 on whom saragossa had fallen in formidable
ruin frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels and began to
regret palafox it is the nature of france to prefer to have rostopchine
from a still more serious point of view and one which it is also proper
to insist upon here this war which wounded the military spirit
of france enraged the democratic spirit it was an enterprise of
inthralment in that campaign the object of the french soldier the
son of democracy was the conquest of a yoke for others a hideous
contradiction france is made to arouse the soul of nations not to
stifle it all the revolutions of europe since 1792 are the french
revolution liberty darts rays from france that is a solar fact blind
is he who will not see it was bonaparte who said it
the war of 1823 an outrage on the generous spanish nation was then
at the same time an outrage on the french revolution it was france
who committed this monstrous violence by foul means for with the
exception of wars of liberation everything that armies do is by foul
means the words passive obedience indicate this an army is a strange
masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum
of impotence thus is war made by humanity against humanity despite
as for the bourbons the war of 1823 was fatal to them they took it for
a success they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea
slain to order they went astray in their innocence to such a degree
that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their
establishment as an element of strength the spirit of the ambush
entered into their politics 1830 had its germ in 1823 the spanish
campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for
adventures by right divine france having re established elrey netto
in spain might well have re established the absolute king at home they
fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for
the consent of the nation such confidence is the ruin of thrones it is
not permitted to fall asleep either in the shadow of a machineel tree
during the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo
a squadron had been cruising in the mediterranean we have just stated
that the orion belonged to this fleet and that accidents of the sea had
the presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which
attracts and engages a crowd it is because it is great and the crowd
a ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the
genius of man with the powers of nature
a ship of the line is composed at the same time of the heaviest and
the lightest of possible matter for it deals at one and the same time
with three forms of substance solid liquid and fluid and it must
do battle with all three it has eleven claws of iron with which to
seize the granite on the bottom of the sea and more wings and more
antennae than winged insects to catch the wind in the clouds its
breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through
enormous trumpets and replies proudly to the thunder the ocean seeks
to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows but the
vessel has its soul its compass which counsels it and always shows it
the north in the blackest nights its lanterns supply the place of
the stars thus against the wind it has its cordage and its canvas
against the water wood against the rocks its iron brass and lead
against the shadows its light against immensity a needle
if one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which
taken as a whole constitute the ship of the line one has only to enter
one of the six story covered construction stocks in the ports of brest
or toulon the vessels in process of construction are under a bell glass
there as it were this colossal beam is a yard that great column of
wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is
the main mast taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the
clouds it is sixty fathoms long and its diameter at its base is
three feet the english main mast rises to a height of two hundred and
seventeen feet above the water line the navy of our fathers employed
cables ours employs chains the simple pile of chains on a ship of a
hundred guns is four feet high twenty feet in breadth and eight
feet in depth and how much wood is required to make this ship three
thousand cubic metres it is a floating forest
and moreover let this be borne in mind it is only a question here of
the military vessel of forty years ago of the simple sailing vessel
steam then in its infancy has since added new miracles to that prodigy
which is called a war vessel at the present time for example the
mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine propelled by three
thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five
not to mention these new marvels the ancient vessel of christopher
columbus and of de ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man it is as
inexhaustible in force as is the infinite in gales it stores up
the wind in its sails it is precise in the immense vagueness of the
there comes an hour nevertheless when the gale breaks that sixty foot
yard like a straw when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall
when that anchor which weighs tens of thousands is twisted in the jaws
of the waves like a fishermans hook in the jaws of a pike when those
monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars which the hurricane
bears forth into the void and into night when all that power and all
that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior
every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense
feebleness it affords men food for thought hence in the ports curious
people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation
without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why every day
accordingly from morning until night the quays sluices and the
jetties of the port of toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers
and loungers as they say in paris whose business consisted in staring
the orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time in the course
of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its
keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed it had gone
into the dry dock the year before this in order to have the barnacles
scraped off then it had put to sea again but this cleaning had
affected the bolts of the keel in the neighborhood of the balearic
isles the sides had been strained and had opened and as the plating
in those days was not of sheet iron the vessel had sprung a leak
a violent equinoctial gale had come up which had first staved in
a grating and a porthole on the larboard side and damaged the
foretop gallant shrouds in consequence of these injuries the orion had
it anchored near the arsenal it was fully equipped and repairs were
begun the hull had received no damage on the starboard but some of the
planks had been unnailed here and there according to custom to permit
one morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident
illustration the ship orion an accident 2b2 1 the ship orion
the crew was busy bending the sails the topman who had to take the
upper corner of the main top sail on the starboard lost his balance
he was seen to waver the multitude thronging the arsenal quay uttered a
cry the mans head overbalanced his body the man fell around the yard
with his hands outstretched towards the abyss on his way he seized the
footrope first with one hand then with the other and remained hanging
from it the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth the shock of his fall
had imparted to the foot rope a violent swinging motion the man swayed
back and forth at the end of that rope like a stone in a sling
it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance not one
of the sailors all fishermen of the coast recently levied for the
service dared to attempt it in the meantime the unfortunate topman
was losing his strength his anguish could not be discerned on his face
but his exhaustion was visible in every limb his arms were contracted
in horrible twitchings every effort which he made to re ascend served
but to augment the oscillations of the foot rope he did not shout for
fear of exhausting his strength all were awaiting the minute when he
should release his hold on the rope and from instant to instant heads
were turned aside that his fall might not be seen there are moments
when a bit of rope a pole the branch of a tree is life itself and
it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and
all at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility
of a tiger cat this man was dressed in red he was a convict he wore a
green cap he was a life convict on arriving on a level with the top a
gust of wind carried away his cap and allowed a perfectly white head to
be seen he was not a young man
a convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had in
fact at the very first instant hastened to the officer of the watch
and in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew
while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back he had asked
the officers permission to risk his life to save the topman at an
affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his
ankle with one blow of a hammer then he had caught up a rope and had
dashed into the rigging no one noticed at the instant with what ease
that chain had been broken it was only later on that the incident was
in a twinkling he was on the yard he paused for a few seconds and
appeared to be measuring it with his eye these seconds during which
the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread seemed
centuries to those who were looking on at last the convict raised his
eyes to heaven and advanced a step the crowd drew a long breath he was
seen to run out along the yard on arriving at the point he fastened
the rope which he had brought to it and allowed the other end to hang
down then he began to descend the rope hand over hand and then and
the anguish was indescribable instead of one man suspended over the
one would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly only here the
spider brought life not death ten thousand glances were fastened on
this group not a cry not a word the same tremor contracted every
brow all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the
slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men
in the meantime the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a
position near the sailor it was high time one minute more and the
exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into
the abyss the convict had moored him securely with the cord to which
he clung with one hand while he was working with the other at last he
was seen to climb back on the yard and to drag the sailor up after him
he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength then he
grasped him in his arms and carried him walking on the yard himself to
the cap and from there to the main top where he left him in the hands
at that moment the crowd broke into applause old convict sergeants
among them wept and women embraced each other on the quay and all
voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage pardon for that
he in the meantime had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin
his detachment in order to reach them the more speedily he dropped
into the rigging and ran along one of the lower yards all eyes were
following him at a certain moment fear assailed them whether it was
that he was fatigued or that his head turned they thought they saw him
hesitate and stagger all at once the crowd uttered a loud shout the
the fall was perilous the frigate algesiras was anchored alongside the
orion and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels it was
to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them four men
flung themselves hastily into a boat the crowd cheered them on
anxiety again took possession of all souls the man had not risen to
the surface he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple as
though he had fallen into a cask of oil they sounded they dived in
vain the search was continued until the evening they did not even find
on the following day the toulon newspaper printed these lines
nov 17 1823 yesterday a convict belonging to the detachment on
board of the orion on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor
fell into the sea and was drowned the body has not yet been found it
is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the arsenal point
this man was committed under the number 9430 and his name was jean
book third accomplishment of the promise made to the dead woman
montfermeil is situated between livry and chelles on the southern edge
of that lofty table land which separates the ourcq from the marne at
the present day it is a tolerably large town ornamented all the year
through with plaster villas and on sundays with beaming bourgeois in
1823 there were at montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so
many well satisfied citizens it was only a village in the forest some
pleasure houses of the last century were to be met with there to be
sure which were recognizable by their grand air their balconies in
twisted iron and their long windows whose tiny panes cast all sorts
of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters but
montfermeil was none the less a village retired cloth merchants and
rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet it was a peaceful
and charming place which was not on the road to anywhere there people
lived and cheaply that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and
so easy only water was rare there on account of the elevation of the
it was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance the end of
the village towards gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds
which exist in the woods there the other end which surrounds the
church and which lies in the direction of chelles found drinking water
only at a little spring half way down the slope near the road to
chelles about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil
thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water the
large houses the aristocracy of which the thenardier tavern formed a
part paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of
it and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying
montfermeil with water but this good man only worked until seven
oclock in the evening in summer and five in winter and night once
come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed he who had no
water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it
this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has
probably not forgotten little cosette it will be remembered that
cosette was useful to the thenardiers in two ways they made the mother
pay them and they made the child serve them so when the mother ceased
to pay altogether the reason for which we have read in preceding
chapters the thenardiers kept cosette she took the place of a servant
in their house in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when
it was required so the child who was greatly terrified at the idea of
going to the spring at night took great care that water should never be
christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at montfermeil
the beginning of the winter had been mild there had been neither snow
nor frost up to that time some mountebanks from paris had obtained
permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of
the village and a band of itinerant merchants under protection of the
same tolerance had constructed their stalls on the church square
and even extended them into boulanger alley where as the reader will
perhaps remember the thenardiers hostelry was situated these people
filled the inns and drinking shops and communicated to that tranquil
little district a noisy and joyous life in order to play the part of
a faithful historian we ought even to add that among the curiosities
displayed in the square there was a menagerie in which frightful
clowns clad in rags and coming no one knew whence exhibited to
the peasants of montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible brazilian
vultures such as our royal museum did not possess until 1845 and which
have a tricolored cockade for an eye i believe that naturalists call
this bird caracara polyborus it belongs to the order of the apicides
and to the family of the vultures some good old bonapartist soldiers
who had retired to the village went to see this creature with great
devotion the mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a
unique phenomenon made by god expressly for their menagerie
on christmas eve itself a number of men carters and peddlers were
seated at table drinking and smoking around four or five candles in
the public room of thenardiers hostelry this room resembled all
drinking shop rooms tables pewter jugs bottles drinkers smokers
but little light and a great deal of noise the date of the year 1823
was indicated nevertheless by two objects which were then fashionable
in the bourgeois class to wit a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin
the female thenardier was attending to the supper which was roasting in
front of a clear fire her husband was drinking with his customers and
besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects
the spanish war and m le duc dangouleme strictly local parentheses
like the following were audible amid the uproar
about nanterre and suresnes the vines have flourished greatly when
ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve they have yielded a
great deal of juice under the press but the grapes cannot be ripe
in those parts the grapes should not be ripe the wine turns oily as
soon as spring comes then it is very thin wine there are wines
poorer even than these the grapes must be gathered while green etc
are we responsible for what is in the sacks we find in them a quantity
of small seed which we cannot sift out and which we are obliged to send
through the mill stones there are tares fennel vetches hempseed
fox tail and a host of other weeds not to mention pebbles which
abound in certain wheat especially in breton wheat i am not fond of
grinding breton wheat any more than long sawyers like to saw beams with
nails in them you can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding and
then people complain of the flour they are in the wrong the flour is
in a space between two windows a mower who was seated at table with a
landed proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be

thing sir it makes no difference with that grass your grass is young
and very hard to cut still its terribly tender it yields before the
cosette was in her usual place seated on the cross bar of the kitchen
table near the chimney she was in rags her bare feet were thrust into
wooden shoes and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen
stockings destined for the young thenardiers a very young kitten was
playing about among the chairs laughter and chatter were audible in
the adjoining room from two fresh childrens voices it was eponine and
in the chimney corner a cat o nine tails was hanging on a nail
at intervals the cry of a very young child which was somewhere in the
house rang through the noise of the dram shop it was a little boy
who had been born to the thenardiers during one of the preceding
winters she did not know why she said the result of the
cold and who was a little more than three years old the mother had
nursed him but she did not love him when the persistent clamor of the
brat became too annoying your son is squalling thenardier would
say do go and see what he wants bah the mother would reply he
bothers me and the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark
so far in this book the thenardiers have been viewed only in profile
the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple and
thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday madame thenardier was
approaching her forties which is equivalent to fifty in a woman so
that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife
our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this thenardier
woman ever since her first appearance tall blond red fat angular
square enormous and agile she belonged as we have said to the
race of those colossal wild women who contort themselves at fairs with
paving stones hanging from their hair she did everything about the
house made the beds did the washing the cooking and everything
else cosette was her only servant a mouse in the service of an
elephant everything trembled at the sound of her voice window panes
furniture and people her big face dotted with red blotches
presented the appearance of a skimmer she had a beard she was an ideal
market porter dressed in womans clothes she swore splendidly she
boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist except
for the romances which she had read and which made the affected lady
peep through the ogress at times in a very queer way the idea would
never have occurred to any one to say of her that is a woman
this thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a
fishwife when one heard her speak one said that is a gendarme when
one saw her drink one said that is a carter when one saw her handle
cosette one said that is the hangman one of her teeth projected
thenardier was a small thin pale angular bony feeble man who had
a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy his cunning began here
he smiled habitually by way of precaution and was almost polite to
everybody even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing he had
the glance of a pole cat and the bearing of a man of letters he greatly
resembled the portraits of the abbe delille his coquetry consisted in
drinking with the carters no one had ever succeeded in rendering him
drunk he smoked a big pipe he wore a blouse and under his blouse an
old black coat he made pretensions to literature and to materialism
there were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever
things he might be saying voltaire raynal parny and singularly
enough saint augustine he declared that he had a system in
addition he was a great swindler a filousophe philosophe a
scientific thief the species does exist it will be remembered that he
pretended to have served in the army he was in the habit of relating
with exuberance how being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light
something or other at waterloo he had alone and in the presence of a
squadron of death dealing hussars covered with his body and saved
from death in the midst of the grape shot a general who had been
dangerously wounded thence arose for his wall the flaring sign and
for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood of the cabaret
of the sergeant of waterloo he was a liberal a classic and a
bonapartist he had subscribed for the champ dasile it was said in the
village that he had studied for the priesthood
we believe that he had simply studied in holland for an inn keeper this
rascal of composite order was in all probability some fleming from
lille in flanders a frenchman in paris a belgian at brussels being
comfortably astride of both frontiers as for his prowess at waterloo
the reader is already acquainted with that it will be perceived that
he exaggerated it a trifle ebb and flow wandering adventure was
the leven of his existence a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary
life and apparently at the stormy epoch of june 18 1815 thenardier
belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken
beating about the country selling to some stealing from others and
travelling like a family man with wife and children in a rickety
cart in the rear of troops on the march with an instinct for always
attaching himself to the victorious army this campaign ended and
having as he said some quibus he had come to montfermeil and set up
this quibus composed of purses and watches of gold rings and silver
crosses gathered in harvest time in furrows sown with corpses did
not amount to a large total and did not carry this sutler turned
thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures
which accompanied by an oath recalls the barracks and by a sign
of the cross the seminary he was a fine talker he allowed it to be
thought that he was an educated man nevertheless the schoolmaster had
he composed the travellers tariff card in a superior manner but
practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it
thenardier was cunning greedy slothful and clever he did not disdain
his servants which caused his wife to dispense with them this giantess
was jealous it seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must
thenardier who was above all an astute and well balanced man was a
scamp of a temperate sort this is the worst species hypocrisy enters
it is not that thenardier was not on occasion capable of wrath to
quite the same degree as his wife but this was very rare and at such
times since he was enraged with the human race in general as he bore
within him a deep furnace of hatred and since he was one of those
people who are continually avenging their wrongs who accuse everything
that passes before them of everything which has befallen them and who
are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand as a
legitimate grievance the sum total of the deceptions the bankruptcies
and the calamities of their lives when all this leaven was stirred up
in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes he was terrible woe to
the person who came under his wrath at such a time
in addition to his other qualities thenardier was attentive and
penetrating silent or talkative according to circumstances and always
highly intelligent he had something of the look of sailors who are
accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses
every new comer who entered the tavern said on catching sight of madame
thenardier there is the master of the house a mistake she was not
even the mistress the husband was both master and mistress she worked
he created he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant
magnetic action a word was sufficient for him sometimes a sign the
mastodon obeyed thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in
madame thenardiers eyes though she did not thoroughly realize it
she was possessed of virtues after her own kind if she had ever had a
disagreement as to any detail with monsieur thenardier which was
an inadmissible hypothesis by the way she would not have blamed
her husband in public on any subject whatever she would never have
committed before strangers that mistake so often committed by women
and which is called in parliamentary language exposing the crown
although their concord had only evil as its result there was
contemplation in madame thenardiers submission to her husband that
mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that
frail despot viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side this was that
grand and universal thing the adoration of mind by matter for certain
ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty there
was an unknown quantity about thenardier hence the absolute empire
of the man over that woman at certain moments she beheld him like a
lighted candle at others she felt him like a claw
this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her
children and who did not fear any one except her husband she was a
mother because she was mammiferous but her maternity stopped short with
her daughters and as we shall see did not extend to boys the man had
he did not succeed in this a theatre worthy of this great talent was
lacking thenardier was ruining himself at montfermeil if ruin is
possible to zero in switzerland or in the pyrenees this penniless scamp
would have become a millionaire but an inn keeper must browse where
it will be understood that the word inn keeper is here employed in a
restricted sense and does not extend to an entire class
in this same year 1823 thenardier was burdened with about fifteen
hundred francs worth of petty debts and this rendered him anxious
whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case
thenardier was one of those men who understand best with the most
profundity and in the most modern fashion that thing which is a virtue
among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized
peoples hospitality besides he was an admirable poacher and quoted
for his skill in shooting he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh
his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
he had professional aphorisms which he inserted into his wifes mind
the duty of the inn keeper he said to her one day violently and in
a low voice is to sell to the first comer stews repose light fire
dirty sheets a servant lice and a smile to stop passers by to empty
small purses and to honestly lighten heavy ones to shelter travelling
families respectfully to shave the man to pluck the woman to pick
the child clean to quote the window open the window shut the
chimney corner the arm chair the chair the ottoman the stool the
feather bed the mattress and the truss of straw to know how much
the shadow uses up the mirror and to put a price on it and by five
hundred thousand devils to make the traveller pay for everything even
this man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded a hideous and
while the husband pondered and combined madame thenardier thought not
of absent creditors took no heed of yesterday nor of to morrow and
lived in a fit of anger all in a minute
such were these two beings cosette was between them subjected to their
double pressure like a creature who is at the same time being ground up
in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers the man and the woman each
had a different method cosette was overwhelmed with blows this was the
womans she went barefooted in winter that was the mans doing
cosette ran up stairs and down washed swept rubbed dusted ran
fluttered about panted moved heavy articles and weak as she was
did the coarse work there was no mercy for her a fierce mistress and
venomous master the thenardier hostelry was like a spiders web in
which cosette had been caught and where she lay trembling the ideal
of oppression was realized by this sinister household it was something
what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god
find themselves thus at the very dawn of life very small and in the
chapter iii men must have wine and horses must have water
cosette was meditating sadly for although she was only eight years
old she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the
lugubrious air of an old woman her eye was black in consequence of a
blow from madame thenardiers fist which caused the latter to remark
from time to time how ugly she is with her fist blow on her eye
cosette was thinking that it was dark very dark that the pitchers and
caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have
been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern
she was somewhat reassured because no one in the thenardier
establishment drank much water thirsty people were never lacking there
but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to
the pitcher any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those
glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men but there
came a moment when the child trembled madame thenardier raised the
cover of a stew pan which was boiling on the stove then seized a glass
and briskly approached the cistern she turned the faucet the child
had raised her head and was following all the womans movements a thin
stream of water trickled from the faucet and half filled the glass
well said she there is no more water a momentary silence ensued
bah resumed madame thenardier examining the half filled glass this
cosette applied herself to her work once more but for a quarter of an
hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow flake
she counted the minutes that passed in this manner and wished it were
from time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street and
exclaimed its as black as an oven or one must needs be a cat
to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour and cosette
all at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered and
i tell you that it has not retorted the pedler
oh yes sir said she the horse has had a drink he drank out of a
bucket a whole bucketful and it was i who took the water to him and i
theres a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house
exclaimed the pedler i tell you that he has not been watered you
little jade he has a way of blowing when he has had no water which i
