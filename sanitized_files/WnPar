made and exchanging remarks the old count rose once more glanced at a
note lying beside his plate and proposed a toast to the health of the
hero of our last campaign prince peter ivanovich bagration and again
his blue eyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred voices
again but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed
russians oer all barriers on courage conquest guarantees have we not
bagration he brings foe men to their knees etc
as soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposed
and count ilya rostov became more and more moved more glass was
smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to bekleshev
naryshkin uvarov dolgorukov apraksin valuev to the committee to
all the club members and to all the club guests and finally to count
ilya rostov separately as the organizer of the banquet at that toast
the count took out his handkerchief and covering his face wept
pierre sat opposite dolokhov and nicholas rostov as usual he ate and
drank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed that
some great change had come over him that day he was silent all through
dinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes and
a look of complete absent mindedness kept rubbing the bridge of his
nose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hear
nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
the unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
princess his cousin at moscow concerning dolokhovs intimacy with his
wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which in
the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly
through his spectacles but that his wifes connection with dolokhov was
a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely disbelieved both the
princess hints and the letter but he feared now to look at dolokhov
who was sitting opposite him every time he chanced to meet dolokhovs
handsome insolent eyes pierre felt something terrible and monstrous
rising in his soul and turned quickly away involuntarily recalling his
wifes past and her relations with dolokhov pierre saw clearly that
what was said in the letter might be true or might at least seem to be
true had it not referred to his wife he involuntarily remembered how
dolokhov who had fully recovered his former position after the
campaign had returned to petersburg and come to him availing himself
of his friendly relations with pierre as a boon companion dolokhov had
come straight to his house and pierre had put him up and lent him
money pierre recalled how helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of
dolokhovs living at their house and how cynically dolokhov had praised
his wifes beauty to him and from that time till they came to moscow had
yes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it would be
particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me just
because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helped
him i know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure
of deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were true but i do
not believe it i have no right to and cant believe it he
remembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in his moments of
cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into
the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason or
shot a post boys horse with a pistol that expression was often on
dolokhovs face when looking at him yes he is a bully thought
pierre to kill a man means nothing to him it must seem to him that
everyone is afraid of him and that must please him he must think that
i too am afraid of him and in fact i am afraid of him he thought
and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul
dolokhov denisov and rostov were now sitting opposite pierre and
seemed very gay rostov was talking merrily to his two friends one of
whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake
and every now and then he glanced ironically at pierre whose
preoccupied absent minded and massive figure was a very noticeable one
at the dinner rostov looked inimically at pierre first because pierre
appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beauty
and in a word an old woman and secondly because pierre in his
preoccupation and absent mindedness had not recognized rostov and had
not responded to his greeting when the emperors health was drunk
pierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his glass
what are you about shouted rostov looking at him in an ecstasy of
exasperation dont you hear its his majesty the emperors health
pierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting till
all were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rostov
why i didnt recognize you he said but rostov was otherwise
why dont you renew the acquaintance said dolokhov to rostov
one should make up to the husbands of pretty women said denisov
pierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talking
well now to the health of handsome women said dolokhov and with a
serious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
mouth he turned with his glass to pierre
heres to the health of lovely women peterkin and their lovers he
pierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking at
dolokhov or answering him the footman who was distributing leaflets
with kutuzovs cantata laid one before pierre as one of the principal
guests he was just going to take it when dolokhov leaning across
snatched it from his hand and began reading it pierre looked at
dolokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous that
had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him he
leaned his whole massive body across the table
hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvitski and the
neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bezukhov
dont dont what are you about whispered their frightened voices
dolokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that
smile of his which seemed to say ah this is what i like
pale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copy
you you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and pushing
back his chair he rose from the table
at the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre felt
that the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him the
whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative he
hated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovs request
that he would take no part in the matter rostov agreed to be dolokhovs
second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with
nesvitski bezukhovs second pierre went home but rostov with dolokhov
and denisov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsies
well then till tomorrow at sokolniki said dolokhov as he took leave
and do you feel quite calm rostov asked
well you see ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words
if you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and write
affectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may be
killed you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firm
intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible and
then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tell
me everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fears
all gone and your only thought is not to let him get away and thats
how it is with me a demain mon cher 
next day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvitski drove to the
sokolniki forest and found dolokhov denisov and rostov already there
pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no
connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow he had
evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwed
up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed by two
considerations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night he
had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dolokhov who had
no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him i
should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought pierre
its even certain that i should have done the same then why this duel
this murder either i shall kill him or he will hit me in the head or
elbow or knee cant i go away from here run away bury myself
somewhere passed through his mind but just at moments when such
thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm and
absent minded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers will it
when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers
and the pistols loaded nesvitski went up to pierre
i should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones and
should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
choosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment i
did not tell you the whole truth i think there is no sufficient ground
for this affair or for blood to be shed over it you were not right
not quite in the right you were impetuous
oh yes it is horribly stupid said pierre
then allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent will
accept them said nesvitski who like the others concerned in the
affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that the
affair had come to an actual duel you know count it is much more
honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparable
there was no insult on either side allow me to convey
no what is there to talk about said pierre its all the same
is everything ready he added only tell me where to go and where to
shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smile
he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his hand a fact that he
oh yes like that i know i only forgot said he
no apologies none whatever said dolokhov to denisov who on his side
had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to the
the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road where
the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forest
covered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during the
last few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks in
the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
nesvitskis and dolokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground ten
paces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at forty
paces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had been
ready but they still delayed and all were silent
all right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling of
dread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun
could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
denisov first went to the barrier and announced as the advesawies
have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and at
o ne t wo thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside
the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to
one another beginning to see one another through the mist they had the
right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier dolokhov
walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with his
bright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face his mouth wore
so i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word three he
went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into the
deep snow he held the pistol in his right hand at arms length
apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left hand he held
carefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it and
knew he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed off the
track into the snow pierre looked down at his feet then quickly
glanced at dolokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown fired
not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered at the sound and
then smiling at his own sensations stood still the smoke rendered
denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instant
but there was no second report as he had expected he only heard
dolokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smoke
he was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched his
drooping pistol his face was pale rostov ran toward him and said
no o o muttered dolokhov through his teeth no its not over and
after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank on
the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coat
and supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid and
plea began dolokhov but could not at first pronounce the word
pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dolokhov and
was about to cross the space between the barriers when dolokhov cried
to your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by his
saber only ten paces divided them dolokhov lowered his head to the
snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drew
in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked and
swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smiling
glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining
sideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesvitski
cover yourself even denisov cried to his adversary
pierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs
helplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facing
dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him denisov rostov and nesvitski
closed their eyes at the same instant they heard a report and
missed shouted dolokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on the
pierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the forest
trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words
folly folly death lies he repeated puckering his face
rostov and denisov drove away with the wounded dolokhov
the latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
a word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he
suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rostov who
was sitting beside him by the hand rostov was struck by the totally
altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dolokhovs
bad but its not that my friend  said dolokhov with a gasping voice
where are we in moscow i know i dont matter but i have killed her
killed she wont get over it she wont survive
my mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and dolokhov
when he had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that he was
living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it
he implored rostov to go on and prepare her
rostov went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise
learned that dolokhov the brawler dolokhov the bully lived in moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate
pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and in
moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the duel
he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in his
fathers room that huge room in which count bezukhov had died
he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had
happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings
thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the
room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days of
their marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on
her face and then immediately he saw beside her dolokhovs handsome
insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet and
then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when
what has happened he asked himself i have killed her lover yes
killed my wifes lover yes that was it and why how did i come to do
it because you married her answered an inner voice
but in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without loving
her in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalled that moment
after supper at prince vasilis when he spoke those words he had found
so difficult to utter i love you it all comes from that even then
i felt it he thought i felt then that it was not so that i had no
right to do it and so it turns out
he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of
how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
steward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at his
dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful
but how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beauty
and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which she
received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty so
this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understand
her how often when considering her character i have told myself that i
was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding that
constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
woman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself be
kissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous let him
do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her if she
felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said she
was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going to
then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she had
been brought up in the most aristocratic circles
im not such a fool just you try it on allez vous promener 
she used to say often seeing the success she had with young and old men
and women pierre could not understand why he did not love her
yes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was a depraved
woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and now theres
dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying
while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado
pierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what is
called weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles he
it is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that why
did i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime  to her which
was a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endure what a
slur on my name a misfortune for life oh thats nonsense he
thought the slur on my name and honor thats all apart from myself
louis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
criminal came into pierres head and from their point of view they
were right as were those too who canonized him and died a martyrs
death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a despot
who is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alive live
tomorrow youll die as i might have died an hour ago and is it worth
tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparison
but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt the
blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that je vous
aime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it for the
tenth time molieres words mais que diable allait il faire dans cette
galere occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself
 but what the devil was he doing in that galley
in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
petersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he
resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee pierre
was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand
he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression
the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home
but before pierre could decide what answer he would send the countess
herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was a
wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow with her
imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet she
knew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till the
valet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre looked at
her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by hounds
who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
enemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senseless
and impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down
but looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to
well whats this now what have you been up to now i should like to
so it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel about what
is it meant to prove what i ask you
pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth but
if you wont answer ill tell you helene went on you believe
everything youre told you were told helene laughed that dolokhov
was my lover she said in french with her coarse plainness of speech
uttering the word amant as casually as any other word and you believed
it well what have you proved what does this duel prove that youre a
fool que vous etes un sot but everybody knew that what will be the
result that i shall be the laughingstock of all moscow that everyone
will say that you drunk and not knowing what you were about challenged
a man you are jealous of without cause helene raised her voice and
became more and more excited a man whos a better man than you in
hm hm growled pierre frowning without looking at her and not
and how could you believe he was my lover why because i like his
company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should prefer
dont speak to me i beg you muttered pierre hoarsely
why shouldnt i speak i can speak as i like and i tell you plainly
that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not
have taken lovers des amants but i have not done so said she
pierre wished to say something looked at her with eyes whose strange
expression she did not understand and lay down again he was suffering
physically at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he could
not breathe he knew that he must do something to put an end to this
suffering but what he wanted to do was too terrible
we had better separate he muttered in a broken voice
separate very well but only if you give me a fortune said helene
separate thats a thing to frighten me with
pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her
ill kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table with
a strength he had never before felt he made a step toward her
helenes face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside his
fathers nature showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination and
delight of frenzy he flung down the slab broke it and swooping down
on her with outstretched hands shouted get out in such a terrible
voice that the whole house heard it with horror god knows what he would
have done at that moment had helene not fled from the room
a week later pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
in great russia which formed the larger part of his property and left
two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz and
the loss of prince andrew had reached bald hills and in spite of the
letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made his body had
not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what was worst of
all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place
and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone among
strangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from which
the old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usual
very briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the russians
had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order the
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitz
came a letter from kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had
your son wrote kutuzov fell before my eyes a standard in his hand
and at the head of a regiment he fell as a hero worthy of his father
and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the whole army
it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort myself and
you with the hope that your son is alive for otherwise he would have
been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle a list
of whom has been sent me under flag of truce
after receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in his
study the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but he
was silent with his steward the gardener and the architect and though
he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone
when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
lathe and as usual did not look round at her
ah princess mary he said suddenly in an unnatural voice throwing
down his chisel the wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus and
princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel which
she approached him saw his face and something gave way within her her
eyes grew dim by the expression of her fathers face not sad not
crushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging over
her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst in
life one she had not yet experienced irreparable and incomprehensible
father andrew said the ungraceful awkward princess with such an
indescribable charm of sorrow and self forgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob
bad news hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed kutuzov
writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the
the princess did not fall down or faint she was already pale but on
hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
beautiful radiant eyes it was as if joy a supreme joy apart from the
joys and sorrows of this world overflowed the great grief within her
she forgot all fear of her father went up to him took his hand and
drawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy neck
father she said do not turn away from me let us weep together
scoundrels blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face away
from her destroying the army destroying the men and why go go and
the princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
wept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
leave of her and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw him tender
and amused as he was when he put on the little icon did he believe
had he repented of his unbelief was he now there there in the realms
father tell me how it happened she asked through her tears
go go killed in battle where the best of russian men and russias
glory were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell lise i
when princess mary returned from her father the little princess sat
working and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy calm
peculiar to pregnant women it was evident that her eyes did not see
princess mary but were looking within into herself at something
mary she said moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back
give me your hand she took her sister in laws hand and held it below
her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy lip rose and remained
princess mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
there there do you feel it i feel so strange and do you know mary
i am going to love him very much said lise looking with bright and
princess mary could not lift her head she was weeping
nothing only i feel sad sad about andrew she said wiping away
her tears on her sister in laws knee
several times in the course of the morning princess mary began trying to
prepare her sister in law and every time began to cry unobservant as
was the little princess these tears the cause of which she did not
understand agitated her she said nothing but looked about uneasily as
if in search of something before dinner the old prince of whom she was
always afraid came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
expression and went out again without saying a word she looked at
princess mary then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women
no you know its too soon for news but my father is anxious and i
nothing answered princess mary looking firmly with her radiant eyes
she had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
terrible news from her till after her confinement which was expected
within a few days princess mary and the old prince each bore and hid
their grief in their own way the old prince would not cherish any hope
he made up his mind that prince andrew had been killed and though he
sent an official to austria to seek for traces of his son he ordered a
monument from moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
memory and he told everybody that his son had been killed he tried not
to change his former way of life but his strength failed him he walked
less ate less slept less and became weaker every day princess mary
hoped she prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
dearest said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of
the nineteenth march and her downy little lip rose from old habit but
as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word and even
every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come so now
the smile of the little princess influenced by the general mood though
without knowing its cause was such as to remind one still more of the
dearest im afraid this mornings fruschtique  as foka the cook
what is the matter with you my darling you look pale oh you are
very pale said princess mary in alarm running with her soft
ponderous steps up to her sister in law
your excellency should not mary bogdanovna be sent for said one of
the maids who was present mary bogdanovna was a midwife from the
neighboring town who had been at bald hills for the last fortnight
oh yes assented princess mary perhaps thats it ill go courage
my angel she kissed lise and was about to leave the room
oh no no and besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the
little princess face an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain
no its only indigestion say its only indigestion say so mary
say and the little princess began to cry capriciously like a
suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
affectation princess mary ran out of the room to fetch mary bogdanovna
mon dieu mon dieu oh she heard as she left the room
the midwife was already on her way to meet her rubbing her small plump
white hands with an air of calm importance
mary bogdanovna i think its beginning said princess mary looking at
the midwife with wide open eyes of alarm
well the lord be thanked princess said mary bogdanovna not
hastening her steps you young ladies should not know anything about
but how is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet said the
princess in accordance with lises and prince andrews wishes they had
sent in good time to moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any
no matter princess dont be alarmed said mary bogdanovna well
five minutes later princess mary from her room heard something heavy
being carried by she looked out the men servants were carrying the
large leather sofa from prince andrews study into the bedroom on their
princess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
house now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
what was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps in
and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she did
not venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sitting
down in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling before
the icon stand to her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
did not calm her excitement suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse praskovya savishna who hardly ever came to that room as the old
prince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl round
ive come to sit with you a bit masha said the nurse and here ive
brought the princes wedding candles to light before his saint my
the nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
with her knitting princess mary took a book and began reading only
when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another the
princess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in the
house was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experienced
as she sat in her room but owing to the superstition that the fewer the
people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyone
tried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from the
ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princes
household a common anxiety a softening of the heart and a
consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
there was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants
hall all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfs
quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept the old
prince stepping on his heels paced up and down his study and sent
tikhon to ask mary bogdanovna what news say only that the prince
told me to ask and come and tell me her answer
inform the prince that labor has begun said mary bogdanovna giving
very good said the prince closing the door behind him and tikhon did
not hear the slightest sound from the study after that
after a while he re entered it as if to snuff the candles and seeing
the prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbed
face shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on the
shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
had entered the most solemn mystery in the world continued its course
evening passed night came and the feeling of suspense and softening of
heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased
it was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a relay
of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor from
moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanterns
were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
princess mary had long since put aside her book she sat silent her
luminous eyes fixed on her nurses wrinkled face every line of which
she knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
kerchief and the loose skin that hung under her chin
nurse savishna knitting in hand was telling in low tones scarcely
hearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds of
times before how the late princess had given birth to princess mary in
kishenev with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
god is merciful doctors are never needed she said
suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
window from which the double frame had been removed by order of the
prince one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
returned and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damask
curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill snowy draft
princess mary shuddered her nurse putting down the stocking she was
knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
casement the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
princess my dear theres someone driving up the avenue she said
holding the casement and not closing it with lanterns most likely the
oh my god thank god said princess mary i must go and meet him he
princess mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer
as she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
with lanterns standing at the entrance she went out on the stairs on
a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft on
the landing below philip the footman stood looking scared and holding
another candle still lower beyond the turn of the staircase one could
hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots and a voice that
seemed familiar to princess mary was saying something
gone to bed replied the voice of demyan the house steward who was
then the voice said something more demyan replied and the steps in the
felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly
its andrew thought princess mary no it cant be that would be too
extraordinary and at the very moment she thought this the face and
figure of prince andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered
with snow appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the
candle yes it was he pale thin with a changed and strangely
softened but agitated expression on his face he came up the stairs and
you did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a reply
which he would not have received for the princess was unable to speak
he turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had
entered the hall after him they had met at the last post station and
what a strange fate masha darling and having taken off his cloak and
felt boots he went to the little princess apartment
the little princess lay supported by pillows with a white cap on her
head the pains had just left her strands of her black hair lay round
her inflamed and perspiring cheeks her charming rosy mouth with its
downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully prince andrew entered
and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear and excitement rested
on him without changing their expression i love you all and have done
no harm to anyone why must i suffer so help me her look seemed to
say she saw her husband but did not realize the significance of his
appearance before her now prince andrew went round the sofa and kissed
my darling he said a word he had never used to her before god is
she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach
i expected help from you and i get none none from you either said
her eyes she was not surprised at his having come she did not realize
that he had come his coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or
with their relief the pangs began again and mary bogdanovna advised
the doctor entered prince andrew went out and meeting princess mary
again joined her they began talking in whispers but their talk broke
off at every moment they waited and listened
prince andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to
hers a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw prince andrew he covered his face with his hands
and remained so for some minutes piteous helpless animal moans came
through the door prince andrew got up went to the door and tried to
you cant come in you cant said a terrified voice from within
he began pacing the room the screaming ceased and a few more seconds
went by then suddenly a terrible shriek it could not be hers she
could not scream like that came from the bedroom prince andrew ran to
the door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant
what have they taken a baby in there for thought prince andrew in the
first second a baby what baby why is there a baby there or is
then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears
choked him and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry
sobbing like a child the door opened the doctor with his shirt sleeves
tucked up without a coat pale and with a trembling jaw came out of
the room prince andrew turned to him but the doctor gave him a
bewildered look and passed by without a word a woman rushed out and
seeing prince andrew stopped hesitating on the threshold he went into
his wifes room she was lying dead in the same position he had seen
her in five minutes before and despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
the cheeks the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
its upper lip covered with tiny black hair
i love you all and have done no harm to anyone and what have you done
to me said her charming pathetic dead face
in a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
two hours later prince andrew stepping softly went into his fathers
room the old man already knew everything he was standing close to the
door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
round his sons neck and without a word he began to sob like a child
three days later the little princess was buried and prince andrew went
up the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kiss
and there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes ah
what have you done to me it still seemed to say and prince andrew
felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin
he could neither remedy nor forget he could not weep the old man too
came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one
on the other on her breast and to him too her face seemed to say
ah what have you done to me and why and at the sight the old man
another five days passed and then the young prince nicholas andreevich
was baptized the wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin while
the priest with a goose feather anointed the boys little red and
his grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of dropping
him carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
to the godmother princess mary prince andrew sat in another room
faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font and awaited
the termination of the ceremony he looked up joyfully at the baby when
the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
the wax with the babys hair had not sunk in the font but had floated
rostovs share in dolokhovs duel with bezukhov was hushed up by the
