uneasiness places sinecures dignities power whether well or
capitulations of conscience and that they shall enter the tomb with
their digestion accomplished how agreeable that is i do not say that
with reference to you senator nevertheless it is impossible for me
to refrain from congratulating you you great lords have so you say a
philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined
accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons
the voluptuousness of life admirably this philosophy has been
extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers but you are
good natured princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in
the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much
as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor
chapter ix the brother as depicted by the sister
in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the
bishop of d  and of the manner in which those two sainted women
subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts
even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the
bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to
explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter
from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the
friend of her childhood this letter is in our possession
my good madam not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our
established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine
while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has
made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper
whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours
madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath
my drawing room which contains no furniture and which we use for
spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height
eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded
and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this
was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers
but my room is the one you ought to see madam magloire has discovered
under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings
which without being good are very tolerable the subject is telemachus
being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes
me in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night what
shall i say to you i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an
illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all
off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and
the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum she has
also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier tables of ancient
fashion they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them but
it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly
besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany
i am always very happy my brother is so good he gives all he has to
the poor and sick we are very much cramped the country is trying in
the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need
we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed you see that these are
my brother has ways of his own when he talks he says that a bishop
ought to be so just imagine the door of our house is never fastened
whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brothers room he
fears nothing even at night that is his sort of bravery he says
he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him he exposes
himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even
seem to notice it one must know how to understand him
he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter he
fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters nor night
last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers he would
not take us he was absent for a fortnight on his return nothing had
happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and
said this is the way i have been robbed and then he opened a trunk
full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the
when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him
a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage
was making a noise so that no one might hear me
at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop
him he is terrible now i have ended by getting used to it i make a
sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him he risks himself
as he sees fit i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray
for him and fall asleep i am at ease because i know that if anything
were to happen to him it would be the end of me i should go to the
good god with my brother and my bishop it has cost madam magloire
more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his
imprudences but now the habit has been acquired we pray together we
tremble together and we fall asleep if the devil were to enter this
house he would be allowed to do so after all what is there for us
to fear in this house there is always some one with us who is stronger
than we the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here
this suffices me my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to
me i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to
the care of providence that is the way one has to do with a man who
i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you
desire on the subject of the faux family you are aware that he knows
everything and that he has memories because he is still a very
good royalist they really are a very ancient norman family of the
generalship of caen five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux a
jean de faux and a thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom
was a seigneur de rochefort the last was guy etienne alexandre and was
commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne
his daughter marie louise married adrien charles de gramont son of
the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards
and lieutenant general of the army it is written faux fauq and
good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative
monsieur the cardinal as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in
not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me
she is well works as you would wish and loves me
that is all that i desire the souvenir which she sent through you
reached me safely and it makes me very happy my health is not so very
bad and yet i grow thinner every day farewell my paper is at an end
and this forces me to leave you a thousand good wishes
ps your grand nephew is charming do you know that he will soon be
five years old yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who
had on knee caps and he said what has he got on his knees he is a
charming child his little brother is dragging an old broom about the
as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to
mould themselves to the bishops ways with that special feminine genius
which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself the bishop
of d  in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted
him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent
without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact they trembled but
they let him alone sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in
advance but never at the time nor afterwards they never interfered
with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon
at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he
was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was
his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then
they were nothing more than two shadows in the house they served him
passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared
they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain
cares may be put under constraint thus even when believing him to be
in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature
to such a degree that they no longer watched over him they confided him
moreover baptistine said as we have just read that her brothers end
would prove her own madame magloire did not say this but she knew it
chapter x the bishop in the presence of an unknown light
at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the
preceding pages he did a thing which if the whole town was to be
believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains
in the country near d a man lived quite alone this man we will
state at once was a former member of the convention his name was g
member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in
the little world of d a member of the convention can you imagine
such a thing that existed from the time when people called each other
thou and when they said citizen this man was almost a monster
he had not voted for the death of the king but almost he was a
quasi regicide he had been a terrible man how did it happen that such
a man had not been brought before a provosts court on the return of
the legitimate princes they need not have cut off his head if you
please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for
life an example in short etc besides he was an atheist like all
the rest of those people gossip of the geese about the vulture
was g a vulture after all yes if he were to be judged by the
element of ferocity in this solitude of his as he had not voted for the
death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and
he dwelt at a distance of three quarters of an hour from the city far
from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild
valley no one knew exactly where he had there it was said a sort
of field a hole a lair there were no neighbors not even passers by
since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had
disappeared under a growth of grass the locality was spoken of as
though it had been the dwelling of a hangman
nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time
he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the
valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a
and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit
but let us avow it this idea which seemed natural at the first blush
appeared to him after a moments reflection as strange impossible and
almost repulsive for at bottom he shared the general impression and
the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly
conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on
hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement
still should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil no
the good bishop was perplexed sometimes he set out in that direction
finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young
shepherd who served the member of the convention in his hovel had come
in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was
gaining on him and that he would not live over night thank god
the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too
threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening
breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out
the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop
arrived at the excommunicated spot with a certain beating of the heart
he recognized the fact that he was near the lair he strode over a
ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs
entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of
boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the waste land and behind
lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern
it was a very low hut poor small and clean with a vine nailed
near the door in an old wheel chair the arm chair of the peasants
there was a white haired man smiling at the sun
near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd lad he was offering
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thank you he
said i need nothing and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the
the bishop stepped forward at the sound which he made in walking the
old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the
surprise which a man can still feel after a long life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that any one
bienvenu myriel i have heard that name are you the man whom the
the old man resumed with a half smile
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the
bishop did not take it the bishop confined himself to the remark
i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed you certainly do not
monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover
i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws
on yesterday only my feet were cold to day the chill has ascended to
my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart
i shall stop the sun is beautiful is it not i had myself wheeled
out here to take a last look at things you can talk to me it does not
fatigue me you have done well to come and look at a man who is on
the point of death it is well that there should be witnesses at that
moment one has ones caprices i should have liked to last until the
dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours it will be night
then what does it matter after all dying is a simple affair one has
no need of the light for that so be it i shall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd lad
go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to
i shall die while he sleeps the two slumbers may be good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been he
did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the
whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated
like the rest he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his
grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he
was almost tempted to retort citizen he was assailed by a fancy for
peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which
was not habitual with him this man after all this member of the
convention this representative of the people had been one of the
powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably
the bishop felt in a mood to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a
modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that
humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity
which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from
examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it
did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as
a matter of reproach in connection with any other man a member of the
convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale
of the law even of the law of charity g  calm his body almost
upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form
the subject of astonishment to the physiologist the revolution had
many of these men proportioned to the epoch in this old man one was
conscious of a man put to the proof though so near to his end he
preserved all the gestures of health in his clear glance in his firm
tone in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something
calculated to disconcert death azrael the mohammedan angel of the
sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken
the door g seemed to be dying because he willed it so there was
freedom in his agony his legs alone were motionless it was there that
the shadows held him fast his feet were cold and dead but his head
survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light g 
at this solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who
there was a stone there the bishop sat down the exordium was abrupt
i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a
reprimand you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter
meaning underlying the words after all he replied the smile had
do not congratulate me too much sir i did vote for the death of the
it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity
what do you mean to say resumed the bishop
i mean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance i voted for the death
of that tyrant that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority
falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood man
it is the same thing conscience is the quantity of innate science
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language
so far as louis xvi was concerned i said no i did not think that i
had the right to kill a man but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil
i voted the end of the tyrant that is to say the end of prostitution
for woman the end of slavery for man the end of night for the child
in voting for the republic i voted for that i voted for fraternity
concord the dawn i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and
errors the crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light we
have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that vase of
miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn
you may say troubled joy and to day after that fatal return of the
past which is called 1814 joy which has disappeared alas the work
was incomplete i admit we demolished the ancient regime in deeds we
were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas to destroy abuses is not
sufficient customs must be modified the mill is there no longer the
you have demolished it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a
right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of
progress in any case and in spite of whatever may be said the french
revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent
of christ incomplete it may be but sublime it set free all the
unknown social quantities it softened spirits it calmed appeased
enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the
earth it was a good thing the french revolution is the consecration of
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with
an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed so far as a dying man is
ah there you go 93 i was expecting that word a cloud had been
forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen
hundred years it burst you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within
him had suffered extinction nevertheless he put a good face on the
the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name
of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice a thunderbolt should
commit no error and he added regarding the member of the convention
the conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishops arm
louis xvii let us see for whom do you mourn is it for the innocent
child very good in that case i mourn with you is it for the royal
child i demand time for reflection to me the brother of cartouche
an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve
until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother
of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv an
innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime
monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names
cartouche louis xv to which of the two do you object
a momentary silence ensued the bishop almost regretted having come and
ah monsieur priest you love not the crudities of the true christ
loved them he seized a rod and cleared out the temple his scourge
full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths when he cried
sinite parvulos he made no distinction between the little children
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of
barabbas and the dauphin of herod innocence monsieur is its own
crown innocence has no need to be a highness it is as august in rags
that is true said the bishop in a low voice
i persist continued the conventionary g you have mentioned louis
xvii to me let us come to an understanding shall we weep for all the
innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted
i agree to that but in that case as i have told you we must go back
further than 93 and our tears must begin before louis xvii i will
weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep
with me over the children of the people
equally exclaimed conventionary g  and if the balance must
incline let it be on the side of the people they have been suffering
another silence ensued the conventionary was the first to break it he
raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb
and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogates and
judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of
the death agony it was almost an explosion
yes sir the people have been suffering a long while and hold that
is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me
about louis xvii i know you not ever since i have been in these parts
i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and
seeing no one but that child who helps me your name has reached me in
a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit
but that signifies nothing clever men have so many ways of imposing on
that honest goodman the people by the way i did not hear the sound of
your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the fork
of the roads no doubt i do not know you i tell you you have told me
that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your
moral personality in short i repeat my question who are you you are
a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded
men with heraldic bearings and revenues who have vast prebends the
bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled income ten thousand
in perquisites total twenty five thousand francs who have kitchens
who have liveries who make good cheer who eat moor hens on friday who
strut about a lackey before a lackey behind in a gala coach and
who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus
christ who went barefoot you are a prelate revenues palace horses
servants good table all the sensualities of life you have this like
the rest and like the rest you enjoy it it is well but this says
either too much or too little this does not enlighten me upon the
intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable
intention of bringing wisdom to me to whom do i speak who are you
the bishop hung his head and replied vermis sum i am a worm
a worm of the earth in a carriage growled the conventionary
it was the conventionarys turn to be arrogant and the bishops to be
so be it sir but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces
off behind the trees yonder how my good table and the moor hens which i
eat on friday how my twenty five thousand francs income how my palace
and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that 93 was not
the conventionary passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep
before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me i have
just committed a wrong sir you are at my house you are my guest i
owe you courtesy you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine
myself to combating your arguments your riches and your pleasures are
advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates
that i shall not make use of them i promise you to make no use of them
let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me where were
we what were you saying to me that 93 was inexorable
inexorable yes said the bishop what think you of marat clapping
what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades
the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness
of a point of steel the bishop quivered under it no reply occurred to
him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet the best
of minds will have their fetiches and they sometimes feel vaguely
wounded by the want of respect of logic
the conventionary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is
mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice still there was a
perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes he went on
let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing
apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human
affirmation 93 is alas a rejoinder you think it inexorable sir
but what of the whole monarchy sir carrier is a bandit but what name
do you give to montrevel fouquier tainville is a rascal but what
is your opinion as to lamoignon baville maillard is terrible but
saulx tavannes if you please duchene senior is ferocious but what
epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier jourdan coupe tete
is a monster but not so great a one as m the marquis de louvois sir
sir i am sorry for marie antoinette archduchess and queen but i am
also sorry for that poor huguenot woman who in 1685 under louis the
great sir while with a nursing infant was bound naked to the waist
to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with
milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale beheld
that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman a
mother and a nurse abjure giving her her choice between the death of
her infant and the death of her conscience what say you to that torture
of tantalus as applied to a mother bear this well in mind sir the
french revolution had its reasons for existence its wrath will be
absolved by the future its result is the world made better from its
most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race i
abridge i stop i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the conventionary concluded his
yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions when they are
over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated
the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the
inmost intrenchments of the bishop one remained however and from this
intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur bienvenus resistance
came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the
progress should believe in god good cannot have an impious servitor
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made no reply he was seized
with a fit of trembling he looked towards heaven and in his glance a
tear gathered slowly when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down
his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to
himself while his eyes were plunged in the depths
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said
the infinite is he is there if the infinite had no person person
would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it
would not exist there is then an i that i of the infinite is
the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with
the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld some one when he had spoken
his eyes closed the effort had exhausted him it was evident that he
had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to
him that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death
the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had
come from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion
he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and ice cold
hand in his and bent over the dying man
this hour is the hour of god do you not think that it would be
the conventionary opened his eyes again a gravity mingled with gloom
bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his
dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my
life in meditation study and contemplation i was sixty years of age
when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its
affairs i obeyed abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed
i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and
confessed them our territory was invaded i defended it france was
menaced i offered my breast i was not rich i am poor i have been one
of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered
with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls
which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and
silver i dined in dead tree street at twenty two sous i have succored
the oppressed i have comforted the suffering i tore the cloth from
the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country i
have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards
the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity i have
when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your
profession and there is at peteghem in flanders at the very spot
where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of
urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in
1793 i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good
that i was able after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted
blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed for many years past
i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they
have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the
visage of one damned and i accept this isolation of hatred without
hating any one myself now i am eighty six years old i am on the point
of death what is it that you have come to ask of me
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the conventionary had
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot
be known to us he passed the whole night in prayer on the following
morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about
member of the convention g  he contented himself with pointing
from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling
any allusion to that old wretch of a g  caused him to fall into a
singular preoccupation no one could say that the passage of that soul
before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did
not count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a
bishop there was evidently no conversion to be expected all those
revolutionists are backsliders then why go there what was there to be
seen there he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried
one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself
spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are
inquiring when your greatness will receive the red cap oh oh
thats a coarse color replied the bishop it is lucky that those who
despise it in a cap revere it in a hat
we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves were we to conclude
from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop or a
patriotic cure his meeting which may almost be designated as his
union with conventionary g  left behind it in his mind a sort of
astonishment which rendered him still more gentle that is all
although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician this is
perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the
events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed
let us then go back a few years
some time after the elevation of m myriel to the episcopate the
emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other
bishops the arrest of the pope took place as every one knows on the
night of the 5th to the 6th of july 1809 on this occasion m myriel
was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy
convened at paris this synod was held at notre dame and assembled
for the first time on the 15th of june 1811 under the presidency
of cardinal fesch m myriel was one of the ninety five bishops who
attended it but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four
private conferences bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close
to nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported
among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of
the assembly he very soon returned to d he was interrogated as to
this speedy return and he replied i embarrassed them the outside air
penetrated to them through me i produced on them the effect of an open
on another occasion he said what would you have those gentlemen are
princes i am only a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that he displeased them among other strange things it is
said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at
the house of one of his most notable colleagues what beautiful clocks
what beautiful carpets what beautiful liveries they must be a great
trouble i would not have all those superfluities crying incessantly
in my ears there are people who are hungry there are people who are
cold there are poor people there are poor people
let us remark by the way that the hatred of luxury is not an
intelligent hatred this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
nevertheless in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with
representations and ceremonies it seems to reveal habits which have
very little that is charitable about them an opulent priest is a
contradiction the priest must keep close to the poor now can one come
in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress all these
misfortunes and this poverty without having about ones own person a
little of that misery like the dust of labor is it possible to imagine
a man near a brazier who is not warm can one imagine a workman who is
working near a furnace and who has neither a singed hair nor blackened
nails nor a drop of sweat nor a speck of ashes on his face the first
proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of d thought
it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the ideas
of the century on certain delicate points he took very little part
in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on
questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had
been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an
ultramontane rather than a gallican since we are making a portrait and
since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he
was glacial towards napoleon in his decline beginning with 1813 he
gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations he
refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island
of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor
besides his sister mademoiselle baptistine he had two brothers one a
general the other a prefect he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command
in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general
had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the
emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous
of allowing to escape his correspondence with the other brother the
ex prefect a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris rue
thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour
of bitterness his cloud the shadow of the passions of the moment
traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any
political opinions let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are
not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand
aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic
humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous
intellect without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly
connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this it
would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist
and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from
that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the
fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of
human things the beaming of those three pure radiances truth justice
while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created
monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest
in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just but
perilous resistance to the all powerful napoleon but that which pleases
us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who
are falling we only love the fray so long as there is danger and in
any case the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be
the exterminators of the last he who has not been a stubborn accuser in
prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin the denunciator of
success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall as for us when
providence intervenes and strikes we let it work 1812 commenced to
disarm us in 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn
legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which
aroused indignation and it was a crime to applaud in 1814 in the
presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate
which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having
deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing
and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head in
1815 when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized
with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly
discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army
and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it
and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of
the bishop of d  ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the
august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation
and a great man on the brink of the abyss
with this exception he was in all things just true equitable
intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only
another sort of benevolence he was a priest a sage and a man it must
be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just
reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity
he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking
here the porter of the town hall had been placed there by the emperor
he was an old non commissioned officer of the old guard a member of the
legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the
law then stigmatized as seditious speeches after the imperial profile
disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his
regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his
cross he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the
cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not
put anything in its place i will die he said rather than wear the
three frogs upon my heart he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii the
gouty old creature in english gaiters he said let him take himself
off to prussia with that queue of his he was happy to combine in the
same imprecation the two things which he most detested prussia and
england he did it so often that he lost his place there he was turned
out of the house with his wife and children and without bread the
bishop sent for him reproved him gently and appointed him beadle in
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy
deeds and gentle manners filled the town of d with a sort of
tender and filial reverence even his conduct towards napoleon had been
accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were by the people the good and
weakly flock who adored their emperor but loved their bishop
a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes
just as a general is by a covey of young officers this is what
that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere les pretres
blancs becs callow priests every career has its aspirants who form
a train for those who have attained eminence in it there is no power
which has not its dependents there is no fortune which has not its
court the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present every
metropolis has its staff of officials every bishop who possesses the
least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary
which goes the round and maintains good order in the episcopal palace
and mounts guard over monseigneurs smile to please a bishop is
equivalent to getting ones foot in the stirrup for a sub diaconate
it is necessary to walk ones path discreetly the apostleship does not
just as there are bigwigs elsewhere there are big mitres in the church
these are the bishops who stand well at court who are rich well
endowed skilful accepted by the world who know how to pray no doubt
but who know also how to beg who feel little scruple at making a whole
diocese dance attendance in their person who are connecting links
between the sacristy and diplomacy who are abbes rather than priests
prelates rather than bishops happy those who approach them being
persons of influence they create a shower about them upon the
assiduous and the favored and upon all the young men who understand
the art of pleasing of large parishes prebends archidiaconates
chaplaincies and cathedral posts while awaiting episcopal honors as
they advance themselves they cause their satellites to progress also
it is a whole solar system on the march their radiance casts a gleam
of purple over their suite their prosperity is crumbled up behind
the scenes into nice little promotions the larger the diocese of the
patron the fatter the curacy for the favorite and then there is rome
a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop an archbishop who
knows how to become a cardinal carries you with him as conclavist
you enter a court of papal jurisdiction you receive the pallium and
behold you are an auditor then a papal chamberlain then monsignor
and from a grace to an eminence is only a step and between the eminence
and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot every skull cap may
dream of the tiara the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a
king in a regular manner and what a king the supreme king then what a
nursery of aspirations is a seminary how many blushing choristers
how many youthful abbes bear on their heads perrettes pot of milk
who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation in good
faith perchance and deceiving itself devotee that it is
monseigneur bienvenu poor humble retiring was not accounted among
the big mitres this was plain from the complete absence of young
priests about him we have seen that he did not take in paris not a
single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man
not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its
foliage in his shadow his canons and grand vicars were good old men
rather vulgar like himself walled up like him in this diocese without
exit to a cardinalship and who resembled their bishop with this
difference that they were finished and he was completed the
impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well
understood that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the
seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of aix
or of auch and went off in a great hurry for in short we repeat it
men wish to be pushed a saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation
is a dangerous neighbor he might communicate to you by contagion
an incurable poverty an anchylosis of the joints which are useful in
advancement and in short more renunciation than you desire and
this infectious virtue is avoided hence the isolation of monseigneur
bienvenu we live in the midst of a gloomy society success that is the
lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption
be it said in passing that success is a very hideous thing its false
resemblance to merit deceives men for the masses success has almost
the same profile as supremacy success that menaechmus of talent has
one dupe history juvenal and tacitus alone grumble at it in our
day a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its
service wears the livery of success and performs the service of its
antechamber succeed theory prosperity argues capacity win in the
lottery and behold you are a clever man he who triumphs is venerated
be born with a silver spoon in your mouth everything lies in that be
lucky and you will have all the rest be happy and people will think
you great outside of five or six immense exceptions which compose
the splendor of a century contemporary admiration is nothing but
short sightedness gilding is gold it does no harm to be the first
arrival by pure chance so long as you do arrive the common herd is an
old narcissus who adores himself and who applauds the vulgar herd
that enormous ability by virtue of which one is moses aeschylus dante
michael angelo or napoleon the multitude awards on the spot and by
acclamation to whomsoever attains his object in whatsoever it may
consist let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy let a false
corneille compose tiridate let a eunuch come to possess a harem let a
military prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch
let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe soles for the army of the
sambre and meuse and construct for himself out of this cardboard sold
as leather four hundred thousand francs of income let a pork packer
espouse usury and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions of
which he is the father and of which it is the mother let a preacher
become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl let the steward of a fine
family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister
of finances and men call that genius just as they call the face
of mousqueton beauty and the mien of claude majesty with the
constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are
made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks
we are not obliged to sound the bishop of d on the score of
orthodoxy in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood
but respect the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his
word moreover certain natures being given we admit the possible
development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs
what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery these secrets of
the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where
souls enter naked the point on which we are certain is that the
difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his
case no decay is possible to the diamond he believed to the extent
of his powers credo in patrem he often exclaimed moreover he
drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the
conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god
the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and
beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love it
was in that quarter quia multum amavit because he loved much that
he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and
reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism
takes its word of command from pedantry what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already
pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things he lived
without disdain he was indulgent towards gods creation every man
even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves
for animals the bishop of d had none of that harshness which is
peculiar to many priests nevertheless he did not go as far as the
brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes who
knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth hideousness of aspect
deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his
indignation he was touched almost softened by them it seemed as
though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which
is apparent the cause the explanation or the excuse for them he
seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties he examined
without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a
palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature this
