the valet returning to the cottage informed the count that moscow was
burning the count donned his dressing gown and went out to look sonya
and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only
natasha and the countess remained in the room petya was no longer with
the family he had gone on with his regiment which was making for
the countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natasha
pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons just
where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her fathers
words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant three
oh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled and
frightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn theres an awful
glow natasha do look you can see it from the window she said to her
but natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been in
this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the surprise
and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason found
it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrews wound and of his being
with their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as
she was with sonya sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now
as if trying to atone for her fault paid unceasing attention to her
look natasha how dreadfully it is burning said she
and as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she turned
her face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evident
that she could not see anything and again settled down in her former
yes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left
both the countess and sonya understood that naturally neither moscow
nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to
the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went
up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she
was wont to do when natasha was ill then touched her forehead with her
lips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her
you are cold you are trembling all over youd better lie down said
lie down all right i will ill lie down at once said natasha
when natasha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriously
wounded and was traveling with their party she had at first asked many
questions where was he going how was he wounded was it serious and
could she see him but after she had been told that she could not see
him that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger
she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all evidently disbelieving
what they told her and convinced that say what she might she would
still be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a corner
of the coach with wide open eyes and the expression in them which the
countess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the same
way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she was
planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
in her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did not
natasha undress darling lie down on my bed
a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss
and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor
no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha replied
irritably and she went to the window and opened it through the open
window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put
her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck
shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame natasha knew
it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in
the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage
but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob the countess exchanged
lie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softly
oh yes ill lie down at once said natasha and began hurriedly
undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat
when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket she sat
down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
floor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and
began replaiting it her long thin practiced fingers rapidly
unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side to
side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked fixedly before
her when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door
natasha youd better lie in the middle said sonya
ill stay here muttered natasha do lie down she added crossly
the countess madame schoss and sonya undressed hastily and lay down
the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the
room but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little
mytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noise
of people shouting at a tavern mamonovs cossacks had set up across the
street and the adjutants unceasing moans could still be heard
for a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached
her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard
her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her
then madame schoss familiar whistling snore and sonyas gentle
breathing then the countess called to natasha natasha did not answer
i think shes asleep mamma said sonya softly
after a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
soon after that natasha heard her mothers even breathing natasha did
not move though her little bare foot thrust out from under the quilt
as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in a
crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near by
the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the
no one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and
stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple
bare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously from one
foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against
all the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm and
she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold
damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her with
her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened
the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark
in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on which
something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and
from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews wound
and his presence there natasha had resolved to see him she did not
know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt the
all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now
that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that incessant
moaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether like that in her
imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an
indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under the
quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood
still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she
cautiously took one step and then another and found herself in the
middle of a small room containing baggage another man timokhin was
lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two others the
doctor and a valet lay on the floor
the valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by the
pain in his wounded leg gazed with wide open eyes at this strange
apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap
the valets sleepy frightened exclamation what do you want whats
the matter made natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the
corner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she
passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw
prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as she
he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his
glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck
delicate as a childs revealed by the turn down collar of his shirt
gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never
seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible
he smiled and held out his hand to her
seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance
station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the
inflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the doctors
opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with
pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his
temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the
first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had
remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked
to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into
the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when he
had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with
closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea
his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the
doctor he felt prince andrews pulse and to his surprise and
dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he
knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a
little later with greater suffering timokhin the red nosed major of
prince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken
along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
borodino they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrews valet his
they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with
feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
i dont want any more is timokhin here he asked
mine sir all right but how about you
prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something
the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was
feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but
reasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak
with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of
mortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadful
place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept asking
them to get him the book and put it under him
what trouble would it be to you he said i have not got one please
get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteous
the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands
you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring
water over his hands for just one moment i didnt look after you
its such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it
by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him
the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the
matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi
after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he
again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled
all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the
moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of
a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him
happiness and those thoughts though now vague and indefinite again
possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of
happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels
that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position in
which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts
and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket
chirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in the
street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the
walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of
feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the
power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to
fix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from the
deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
then return again to his own thoughts but prince andrews mind was not
in a normal state in that respect all the powers of his mind were more
active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most
diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his
brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had
never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its
work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength
yes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
deprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut
gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness
lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act
on man a happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving every
man can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible
only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son
and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince andrew
heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft
whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating piti piti
piti and then titi and then again piti piti piti and ti ti
once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very
middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of
slender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music he
felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that
this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept
collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
music it stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said
prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling
the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
of needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and
heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
flopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his
face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his
face where it was rising but besides this there was something else of
importance it was something white by the door the statue of a sphinx
but perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats my
legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing
itself out and piti piti piti and ti ti and piti piti piti
thats enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated
someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of
yes love he thought again quite clearly but not love which loves
for something for some quality for some purpose or for some reason
but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy
and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very
essence of the soul and does not require an object now again i feel
that bliss to love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to love
everything to love god in all his manifestations it is possible to
love someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be loved
by divine love that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i
loved that man what has become of him is he alive
when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but
divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can
destroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have
i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did
her and he vividly pictured to himself natasha not as he had done in
the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the
first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her
feelings her sufferings shame and remorse he now understood for the
first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of his
rupture with her if only it were possible for me to see her once more
just once looking into those eyes to say
piti piti piti and ti ti and piti piti piti boom flopped the fly
and his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world of
reality and delirium in which something particular was happening in
that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall
something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was
still burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door but
besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and
a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had
the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just
oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew
trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained
before him with the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrew
wished to return to that former world of pure thought but he could not
and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice
continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched
out and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all
his strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little and
suddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes and
like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness when he came to
himself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people he most
longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to
him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real living
natasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionless
on her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on
him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the
prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his hand
with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on her
knees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and began
kissing it just touching it lightly with her lips
forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him
forgive me for what i ha ve do ne faltered natasha in a scarcely
audible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just
i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her
face with his hand so as to look into her eyes
those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly
compassionately and with joyous love natashas thin pale face with
its swollen lips was more than plain it was dreadful but prince
andrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful
they heard the sound of voices behind them
peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor
timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had
long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare
body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench
whats this said the doctor rising from his bed please go away
at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her
like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natasha went out of the room
and returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bed
from that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at every
halting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never left the
wounded bolkonski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected
from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a
dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die
in her daughters arms during the journey as judging by what the
doctor said it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose
natasha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded
man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former
engagement would be renewed no one least of all natasha and prince
andrew spoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which
hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia shut out all other
on the third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching the
clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
his body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he
had done the day before that something shameful was his yesterdays
it was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors
pierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engraved
stock which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he remembered
where he was and what lay before him that very day
am i not too late he thought no probably he wont make his entry
pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but
after arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go out
but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficult
to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carry
it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm besides it had been
discharged and he had not had time to reload it no matter dagger
will do he said to himself though when planning his design he had
more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
student in 1809 had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as
his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in proving
to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
green sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistol
having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head
pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
the captain and passed out into the street
the conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference the
evening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was on
fire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the river
in the bazaar and the povarskoy as well as the barges on the moskva
river and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge were all ablaze
pierres way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there to
the church of st nicholas on the arbat where he had long before
decided that the deed should be done the gates of most of the houses
were locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes were deserted
the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and then he met
russians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not of
the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both the
russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides his
height and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in his
face and whole figure the russians stared at pierre because they could
not make out to what class he could belong the french followed him with
astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the other
russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid no
attention to them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who were
explaining something to some russians who did not understand them
stopped pierre asking if he did not know french
pierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinel
standing beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shout
was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the mans musket as
he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
of the street he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
him he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste like
something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nights
experience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring
his mood safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered by
anything on the way his intention could not now have been carried out
for napoleon had passed the arbat more than four hours previously on his
way from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin and was now sitting in a
very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin giving
detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to
extinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure the
inhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed in
what lay before him and was tortured as those are who obstinately
undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its
difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures by the
fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self esteem
though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoy
as pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser he
even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame rose
from under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streets
and they were more excited but pierre though he felt that something
unusual was happening around him did not realize that he was
approaching the fire as he was going along a foot path across a wide
open space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the gardens of prince
gruzinskis house on the other pierre suddenly heard the desperate
weeping of a woman close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dream
by the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of household
goods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on the
ground beside the trunks sat a thin woman no longer young with long
prominent upper teeth and wearing a black cloak and cap this woman
swaying to and fro and muttering something was choking with sobs two
girls of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks
were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale
frightened faces the youngest child a boy of about seven who wore an
overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own was crying in his old
nurses arms a dirty barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk and
having undone her pale colored plait was pulling it straight and
sniffing at her singed hair the womans husband a short round
shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official with
sausage shaped whiskers and showing under his square set cap the hair
smoothly brushed forward over his temples with expressionless face was
moving the trunks which were placed one on another and was dragging
as soon as she saw pierre the woman almost threw herself at his feet
dear people good christians save me help me dear friends help
us somebody she muttered between her sobs my girl my daughter
my youngest daughter is left behind shes burned ooh was it for this
dont mary nikolievna said her husband to her in a low voice
evidently only to justify himself before the stranger sister must have
taken her or else where can she be he added
monster villain shouted the woman angrily suddenly ceasing to weep
you have no heart you dont feel for your own child another man would
have rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and neither a man
nor a father you honored sir are a noble man she went on
addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs the fire broke out
alongside and blew our way the maid called out fire and we rushed
to collect our things we ran out just as we were this is what we
have brought away the icons and my dowry bed all the rest is lost
we seized the children but not katie ooh o lord and again she
began to sob my child my dear one burned burned
from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
oh dear sir she cried seizing him by the legs my benefactor set
my heart at ease aniska go you horrid girl show him the way she
cried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing
show me the way show me i ill do it gasped pierre rapidly
the dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk put up her plait
sighed and went on her short bare feet along the path pierre felt as
if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his head
higher his eyes shone with the light of life and with swift steps he
followed the maid overtook her and came out on the povarskoy the
whole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame here
and there broke through that cloud a great number of people crowded in
front of the conflagration in the middle of the street stood a french
general saying something to those around him pierre accompanied by the
maid was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the french
this way uncle cried the girl well pass through the side street
pierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with her
she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left and
passing three houses turned into a yard on the right
its here close by said she and running across the yard opened a
gate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small wooden
wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its
sides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued from
the openings of the windows and from under the roof
as pierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air and
which is it which is your house he asked
ooh wailed the girl pointing to the wing thats it that was our
lodging youve burned to death our treasure katie my precious little
missy ooh lamented aniska who at the sight of the fire felt that she
pierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that he
involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that
was as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and around
which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize what
these men who were dragging something out were about but seeing
before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
to take from him a fox fur coat he vaguely understood that looting was
going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea
the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the
whistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people and
the sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black clouds
and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there dense
sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
the walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on
pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a
peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt
young bright adroit and resolute he ran round to the other side of
the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
standing when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and
then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close
pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen
who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metal
articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer
what does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to pierre
theres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried pierre
whats he talking about get along said several voices and one of
the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them
some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer moved
a child shouted a frenchman from above i did hear something
squealing in the garden perhaps its his brat that the fellow is
looking for after all one must be human you know
there there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the
garden at the back of the house wait a bit im coming down
and a minute or two later the frenchman a black eyed fellow with a spot
on his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on the
ground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the
hurry up you others he called out to his comrades its getting
when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled
pierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a three
year old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat
there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the
frenchman good bye fatty we must be human we are all mortal you
know and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
breathless with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take
her in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulous looking
child unattractively like her mother began to yell and run away
pierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms she screamed
desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierres
hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seized
by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when
touching some nasty little animal but he made an effort not to throw
the child down and ran with her to the large house it was now however
impossible to get back the way he had come the maid aniska was no
longer there and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the
wet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran
with her through the garden seeking another way out
having run through different yards and side streets pierre got back
with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the
povarskoy he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
out to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goods
that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian families who
had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there were
several french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no notice
of them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierre
felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with the
heat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
the sense of youth animation and determination that had come on him
when he ran to save the child she had now become quiet and clinging
with her little hands to pierres coat sat on his arm gazing about her
like some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a
slight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them he
walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces he
met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting
of a very handsome old man of oriental type wearing a new cloth
covered sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type and
a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of
oriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows and
the extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautiful
expressionless face amid the scattered property and the crowd on the
open space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on
her head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow
she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman and
looked from under her long lashes with motionless large almond shaped
eyes at the ground before her evidently she was aware of her beauty and
fearful because of it her face struck pierre and hurrying along by the
fence he turned several times to look at her when he had reached the
fence still without finding those he sought he stopped and looked
with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
before and a group of russians both men and women gathered about him
have you lost anyone my dear fellow youre of the gentry yourself
arent you whose child is it they asked him
pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
had been sitting there with her other children and he asked whether
why that must be the anferovs said an old deacon addressing a
pockmarked peasant woman lord have mercy lord have mercy he added
the anferovs no said the woman they left in the morning that must
he says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a house
do you know her shes thin with long teeth said pierre
thats mary nikolievna they went inside the garden when these wolves
swooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldiers
go over that way theyre there its she she kept on lamenting and
crying continued the woman its she here this way
but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds been
intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was looking at
the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them
one of these a nimble little man was wearing a blue coat tied round
the waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
bare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was a
long lank round shouldered fair haired man slow in his movements and
with an idiotic expression of face he wore a womans loose gown of
frieze blue trousers and large torn hessian boots the little
barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and
saying something immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
man at once began pulling off his boots the other in the frieze gown
stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands in
his pockets stood staring at her motionless and silent
here take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
woman handing the little girl to her give her back to them give her
back he almost shouted putting the child who began screaming on the
ground and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian family
the old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman had
secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other the
old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs but pierre
caught but a glimpse of this his whole attention was directed to the
frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile swaying slowly from side to
side had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude
with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
frenchman the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from
her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and the young
let that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voice
seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside
the soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing down
the boots and drawing his sword moved threateningly toward pierre
pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
his strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchman
and before the latter had time to draw his sword knocked him off his
feet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval were heard from
the crowd around and at the same moment a mounted patrol of french
uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans came up at a trot to
pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them pierre remembered nothing
of what happened after that he only remembered beating someone and
being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him
lieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre understood
ah a weapon said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier
who had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell all about it
at the court martial then he turned to pierre do you speak french
pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply his face
probably looked very terrible for the officer said something in a
whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
do you speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distance
a little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and by
his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a
french salesman from one of the moscow shops
he does not look like a common man said the interpreter after a
ah he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the officer and
who are you asked the interpreter in poor russian you must answer
i will not tell you who i am i am your prisoner take me pierre
ah ah muttered the officer with a frown well then march
a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood the
pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl and when the patrol
where are they taking you to you poor dear said she and the little
girl the little girl what am i to do with her if shes not theirs
what does that woman want asked the officer
pierre was as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight of the
what does she want he murmured she is bringing me my daughter whom
i have just saved from the flames said he good bye and without
knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him he went along with
resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers
the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets
of moscow by durosnels order to put a stop to the pillage and
especially to catch the incendiaries who according to the general
opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers
were the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a number of
streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects a small
shopkeeper two seminary students a peasant and a house serf besides
several looters but of all these various suspected characters pierre
was considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had all been
brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was
being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guard
in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
with greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the parties
of rumyantsev the french marya fedorovna the tsarevich and others
drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones but the calm
luxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms and
reflections of real life went on in its old way and made it hard
except by a great effort to realize the danger and the difficult
position of the russian people there were the same receptions and
balls the same french theater the same court interests and service
interests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles were
attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position
stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in
these difficult circumstances the empress marya concerned for the
welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her
patronage had given directions that they should all be removed to
kazan and the things belonging to these institutions had already been
packed up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructions
she would be pleased to give with her characteristic russian patriotism
had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
for that was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personally
was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg
at anna pavlovnas on the twenty sixth of august the very day of the
battle of borodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which was
to be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sending
the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was regarded as a model
of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasili himself famed for
his elocution was to read it he used to read at the empress the
art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quite
independently of their meaning in a loud and singsong voice alternating
between a despairing wail and a tender murmur so that the wail fell
quite at random on one word and the murmur on another this reading as
was always the case at anna pavlovnas soirees had a political
significance that evening she expected several important personages who
had to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and aroused
to a patriotic temper a good many people had already arrived but anna
pavlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room
did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhova
she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missed
several gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to be
receiving no one and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who
usually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who
was treating her in some new and unusual way
they all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness arose from
an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time
and that the italians cure consisted in removing such inconvenience
but in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to think of this or even
they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is angina
they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina and
the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction
the count is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the doctor
oh it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman
you are speaking of the poor countess said anna pavlovna coming up
just then i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a little
better oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world she
went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm we belong to different
camps but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves she
supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the
veil from the secret of the countess malady an unwary young man
ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called
in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
your information may be better than mine anna pavlovna suddenly and
venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but i know on good
authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man he is private
