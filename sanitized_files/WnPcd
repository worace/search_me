science says that the more troops the greater the strength les gros
for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequal
to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal
momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity
in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass
military science seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact
that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that
small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of
this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric
formation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in the
genius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meanings
to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic
yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify
the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by
commanders in order to find this unknown quantity
that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say the
greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not
fighting under the command of a genius in two or three line formation
with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men who
want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives
the resulting force to define and express the significance of this
unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science
this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for
the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes
apparent such as the commands of the general the equipment employed
and so on mistaking these for the real significance of the factor and
if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the
greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only then
expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative
significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown
ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions or
divisions conquer that is kill or take captive all the others while
themselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the other
fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen and
therefore 4x  15y consequently xy  154 this equation does not give
us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two
unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles
campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers
could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be
the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking and
in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the
strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under
fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed
than is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out of
account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars
the french retreating in 1812 though according to tactics they should
have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a
mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
held the army together the russians on the contrary ought according
to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into
small units because their spirit had so risen that separate
individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing
any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
the so called partisan war began with the entry of the french into
before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
government thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had
been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off as
instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis davydov
with his russian instinct was the first to recognize the value of this
terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
on august 24 davydovs first partisan detachment was formed and then
others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more
the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the
fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree the
french army and sometimes shook that tree itself by october when the
french were fleeing toward smolensk there were hundreds of such
companies of various sizes and characters there were some that adopted
all the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs and the
comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there were
also small scratch groups of foot and horse and groups of peasants and
landowners that remained unknown a sacristan commanded one party which
captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month and there
was vasilisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds of the
the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
october its first period had passed when the partisans themselves
amazed at their own boldness feared every minute to be surrounded and
captured by the french and hid in the forests without unsaddling
hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the end
of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had become
clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could
not now only the commanders of detachments with staffs and moving
according to rules at a distance from the french still regarded many
things as impossible the small bands that had started their activities
long before and had already observed the french closely considered
things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare
to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french
on october 22 denisov who was one of the irregulars was with his
group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early morning he
and his party had been on the move all day long he had been watching
from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy of
cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
army which as was learned from spies and prisoners was moving under a
strong escort to smolensk besides denisov and dolokhov who also led a
small party and moved in denisovs vicinity the commanders of some
large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and as denisov
expressed it were sharpening their teeth for it two of the commanders
of large parties one a pole and the other a german sent invitations to
denisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with their
no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on reading
these documents and he wrote to the german that despite his heartfelt
desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgo
that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish
general to the polish general he replied to the same effect informing
him that he was already under the command of the german
having arranged matters thus denisov and dolokhov intended without
reporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoy
with their own small forces on october 22 it was moving from the
village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the road
between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests extending in
some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
from it through these forests denisov and his party rode all day
sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning
cossacks of denisovs party had seized and carried off into the forest
two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud not
far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road since then
and until evening the party had watched the movements of the french
without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo
quietly without alarming them and then after joining dolokhov who was
to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmans hut in the forest
less than a mile from shamshevo to surprise the french at dawn falling
like an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capture
in their rear more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came
right up to the road six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh
beyond shamshevo dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way to
find out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned
that the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two hundred and
dolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not
deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that is a man from the
enemy column that mornings attack on the wagons had been made so
hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a
little drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he
could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column
denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of
putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tikhon shcherbaty a
peasant of his party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the
french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance
it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the
color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then
denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse
which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving
rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick
beside denisov rode an esaul  denisovs fellow worker also in felt
cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse
esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow pale
faced fair haired with narrow light eyes and with calm self
satisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in
what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at
the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable
and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw
that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was
not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse
a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and
wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap
a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormous
tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue
beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and
blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to the
hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him
with surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morning
behind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars in
threes and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french
greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses
being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay
their necks with their wet close clinging manes looked strangely
thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wet
slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the
water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
water that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the
back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two
wagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had
been hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
splashed through the water that lay in the ruts
denisovs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped
oh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing his teeth he
struck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and his
denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger
none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he
still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue
therell hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today
its too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off till
another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
from under our noses thought denisov continually peering forward
on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated
there are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposable
that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fond
of using words the cossacks did not know
the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
visible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a weary
gallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled and
drenched whose trousers had worked up to above his knees behind him
standing in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very young
lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisov
from the general said the officer please excuse its not being quite
denisov frowning took the envelope and opened it
there they kept telling us its dangerous its dangerous said
the officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the
dispatch but komarov and i he pointed to the cossack were
prepared we have each of us two pistols but whats this he asked
noticing the french drummer boy a prisoner youve already been in
wostov petya exclaimed denisov having run through the dispatch
why didnt you say who you were and turning with a smile he held out
all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as
befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at their previous
acquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up
blushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he had been
rehearsing and began telling him how he had already been in a battle
near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there
well i am glad to see you denisov interrupted him and his face
michael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom that
german you know he he indicated petya is serving under him
and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
repetition of the german generals demand that he should join forces
with him for an attack on the transport
if we dont take it tomowwow hell snatch it fwom under our noses he
while denisov was talking to the esaul petya abashed by denisovs cold
tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers
furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one
should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possible
will there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding his
hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for
which he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your honor
orders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay till
oh please may i stay with you cried petya
but just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once asked
he gave me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringly
and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place
arranged near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the officer on
the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go and
find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening
denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of
the forest where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the part
of the french bivouac they were to attack next day
well old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us to
denisov petya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the
hussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to the
the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from the
trees denisov the esaul and petya rode silently following the
peasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes and
moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves
silently led them to the edge of the forest
he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where
the screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree that
had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
denisov and petya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was
standing they could see the french immediately beyond the forest on a
downward slope lay a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steep
ravine was a small village and a landowners house with a broken roof
in the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pond
over all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from the
bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards away
crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their un
russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the
carts and their calls to one another could be clearly heard
bwing the prisoner here said denisov in a low voice not taking his
a cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to denisov
pointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and those of
them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and
lifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of an
evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merely
assenting to everything denisov asked him denisov turned away from him
frowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to him
petya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now at
denisov now at the esaul and now at the french in the village and
along the road trying not to miss anything of importance
whether dolokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said denisov with
it is a very suitable spot said the esaul
well send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov continued
theyll cweep up to the garden youll wide up fwom there with the
cossacks he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village and i
with my hussars fwom here and at the signal shot
the hollow is impassable theres a swamp there said the esaul the
horses would sink we must ride round more to the left
while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from
the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared then
another and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices
shouting together came up from the slope for a moment denisov and the
esaul drew back they were so near that they thought they were the cause
of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relate
to them down below a man wearing something red was running through the
marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him
hell get away said the esaul screwing up his eyes
the man whom they called tikhon having run to the stream plunged in so
that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an
instant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran on
the french who had been pursuing him stopped
what a beast said denisov with his former look of vexation what has
hes our plastun i sent him to capture a tongue
oh yes said petya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if
he understood it all though he really did not understand anything of
tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band
he was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when denisov had
come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french
the elder as though shielding himself had replied as all village
elders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them but
when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french and
asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some
more orderers had really been at their village but that tikhon
shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters denisov had
tikhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few words
in the elders presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and
the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish
we dont do the french any harm said tikhon evidently frightened by
denisovs words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you know
we killed a score or so of more orderers but we did no harm else
next day when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten about
this peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to
their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gave
tikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water
flaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude
for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always
brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring
in french captives also denisov then relieved him from drudgery and
began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
tikhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging
behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried
rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses
its teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching
thick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at
arms length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs
or carve spoons in denisovs party he held a peculiar and exceptional
position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done
to push a cart out of the mud with ones shoulders pull a horse out of
a swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more
than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tikhon
it wont hurt that devil hes as strong as a horse they said of him
once a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and
shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tikhon
treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the
subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which
hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banter
him and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be
angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect
of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom
he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more
opportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen
and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars
and willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by denisov
overnight to shamshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he had
not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept
through the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
french and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected by
after talking for some time with the esaul about next days attack
which now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to have
definitely decided on denisov turned his horse and rode back
now my lad well go and get dwy he said to petya
as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into the
forest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging arms
wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazan hat was approaching
with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
stuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he hastily threw something
into the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and
approached his commander it was tikhon his wrinkled and pockmarked
face and narrow little eyes beamed with self satisfied merriment he
lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh
well where did you disappear to inquired denisov
where did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered tikhon
boldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice
why did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well why
oh i took one all right said tikhon
you see i took him first thing at dawn tikhon continued spreading
out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes i took him
into the forest then i see hes no good and think ill go and fetch a
you see what a wogue its just as i thought said denisov to the
what was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily and
angrily that one wouldnt have done for you as if i dont know what
i went for another one tikhon continued and i crept like this
through the wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomach
with a supple movement to show how he had done it one turned up and i
grabbed him like this he jumped up quickly and lightly come
along to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly there
were four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went
for them with my ax this way what are you up to says i christ be
with you shouted tikhon waving his arms with an angry scowl and
yes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
puddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyes
petya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained from
laughing he turned his eyes rapidly from tikhons face to the esauls
and denisovs unable to make out what it all meant
dont play the fool said denisov coughing angrily why didnt you
tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other
then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin
disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called
shcherbaty the gap toothed denisov smiled and petya burst into a
peal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joined
oh but he was a regular good for nothing said tikhon the clothes
on him poor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor why
he says im a generals son myself i wont go he says
you are a bwute said denisov i wanted to question
but i questioned him said tikhon he said he didnt know much
there are a lot of us he says but all poor stuff only soldiers in
name he says shout loud at them he says and youll take them
all tikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely into
ill give you a hundwed sharp lashes thatll teach you to play the
but why are you angry remonstrated tikhon just as if id never seen
your frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and ill fetch you any of
well lets go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhouse
tikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with him
and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes
when the fit of laughter that had seized him at tikhons words and smile
had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a
man he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
a pang in his heart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt
it necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to question
the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrows undertaking that
he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself
the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the
news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him
denisov at once cheered up and calling petya to him said well tell
petya having left his people after their departure from moscow joined
his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
large guerrilla detachment from the time he received his commission
and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the
battle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state of blissful
excitement at being grown up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
miss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted
with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time it
always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being
performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a
when on the twenty first of october his general expressed a wish to send
somebody to denisovs detachment petya begged so piteously to be sent
that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled
petyas mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of riding by
the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the
advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his
pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any
action whatever of denisovs that was why petya had blushed and grown
confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they had
ridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carry
out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the
french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an
attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people
change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected till
then was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero
and tikhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leave
it was already growing dusk when denisov petya and the esaul rode up
to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen and
cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french
could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a
cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room
three officers of denisovs band were converting a door into a tabletop
petya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once began
helping the officers to fix up the dinner table
in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the
table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and salt
sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
with his hands down which the grease trickled petya was in an ecstatic
childish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence that
so then what do you think vasili dmitrich said he to denisov its
all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he
answered his own question you see i was told to find out well i am
finding out only do let me into the very into the chief i
petya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and
into the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smile
only please let me command something so that i may really command
petya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife he
said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton
and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it
please keep it i have several like it said petya blushing
heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some
raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he
has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something
sweet would you like some and petya ran out into the passage to
his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
you want a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul i bought a
capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and hes very
honest thats the chief thing ill be sure to send it to you or
perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn out that happens
sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they are and he
showed a bag a hundred flints i bought them very cheap please take
as many as you want or all if you like
then suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much petya stopped and
he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was
foolish and running over the events of the day he remembered the french
drummer boy its capital for us here but what of him where have they
put him have they fed him havent they hurt his feelings he thought
but having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was now
i might ask he thought but theyll say hes a boy himself and so
he pities the boy ill show them tomorrow whether im a boy will it
seem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and immediately
blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared
may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to
yes hes a poor little fellow said denisov who evidently saw
nothing shameful in this reminder call him in his name is vincent
yes yes call him a poor little fellow denisov repeated
petya was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped in
between the officers came close to denisov and said
let me kiss you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendid
and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut
bosse vincent petya cried stopping outside the door
who do you want sir asked a voice in the darkness
petya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that
vincent the boys name had already been changed by the cossacks into
vesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in both
these adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impression
he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya vesenya
vesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the
hes a smart lad said an hussar standing near petya we gave him
something to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry
the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
darkness and the drummer boy came to the door
ah cest vous said petya voulez vous manger nayez pas peur on
ne vous fera pas de mal  he added shyly and affectionately touching
 ah its you do you want something to eat dont be afraid they
merci monsieur  said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
voice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold
there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy but did
not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then in
the darkness he took the boys hand and pressed it
come in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i do
for him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in first
when the boy had entered the hut petya sat down at a distance from him
considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him but he
fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy
the arrival of dolokhov diverted petyas attention from the drummer boy
to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had had
dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
not sent away with the other prisoners petya had heard in the army many
stories of dolokhovs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the
french so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take his
eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his head
high that he might not be unworthy even of such company
denisov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas the
wonder worker on his breast and his way of speaking and everything he
did indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in moscow had worn
a persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer of
the guards he was clean shaven and wore a guardsmans padded coat with
an order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the
room and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began
questioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of the
designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message petya
had brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him all
thats so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers
said dolokhov it will be necessary to go there we cant start the
affair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to work
accurately here now wouldnt one of these gentlemen like to ride over
to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform
i i ill go with you cried petya
theres no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing
dolokhov and as for him i wont let him go on any account
i like that exclaimed petya why shouldnt i go
well you must excuse me because because i shall go and thats
all youll take me wont you he said turning to dolokhov
why not dolokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the
french drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long he
he was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with me
yes and where do you put the others inquired dolokhov
where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisov
suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single mans life
on my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee
hundwed men to town under escort instead of staining i speak bluntly
that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
sixteen said dolokhov with cold irony but its time for you to drop
why ive not said anything i only say that ill certainly go with
but for you and me old fellow its time to drop these amenities
continued dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
this subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept this lad
he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him dont we
know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirty
get there the rest either starve or get killed so isnt it all the
the esaul screwing up his light colored eyes nodded approvingly
thats not the point im not going to discuss the matter i do not
wish to take it on my conscience you say theyll die all wight only
who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if
they did catch me theyd string me up to an aspen tree and with all
your chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to work
tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it
well are you coming with me he asked petya
i yes yes certainly cried petya blushing almost to tears and
while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with
prisoners petya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he
had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if grown up
distinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought he
but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that ill obey him and
that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with
and to all denisovs persuasions petya replied that he too was
accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he
for youll admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them there
are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of
us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so dont
hinder me said he it will only make things worse
having put on french greatcoats and shakos petya and dolokhov rode to
the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp and
emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the
hollow on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying
him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the
bridge petya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his side
if were caught i wont be taken alive i have a pistol whispered
dont talk russian said dolokhov in a hurried whisper and at that
very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui vive 
the blood rushed to petyas face and he grasped his pistol
lanciers du 6 me  replied dolokhov neither hastening nor slackening
the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge
dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk
dites donc le colonel gerard est ici  he asked
mot dordre repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replying
quand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
mot dordre cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
at the sentinel je vous demande si le colonel est ici 
 when an officer is making his round sentinels dont ask him for the
password i am asking you if the colonel is here
and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped
aside dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk
noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road dolokhov stopped
him and inquired where the commander and officers were the man a
soldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up to
dolokhovs horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and in
a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the
hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called the
having ridden up the road on both sides of which french talk could be
heard around the campfires dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the
landowners house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a big
blazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisily
something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a
soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire was
kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod
oh hes a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sitting
in the shadow at the other side of the fire
hell make them get a move on those fellows said another laughing
both fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound of
dolokhovs and petyas steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire and
one tall long necked officer walking round the fire came up to
