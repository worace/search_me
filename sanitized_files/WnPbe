take them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and then
well drive to the super rogues i suppose youll have everything new
dont judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size the other day young
princess irina vasilevna came to see me she was an awful sight looked
as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now
without some new fashion and what have you to do yourself she
one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a
purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if you
will be so kind ill fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
all right all right theyll be safe with me as safe as in chancery
ill take them where they must go scold them a bit and pet them a
bit said marya dmitrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite
natasha on the cheek with her large hand
next morning marya dmitrievna took the young ladies to the iberian
shrine of the mother of god and to madame suppert roguet who was so
afraid of marya dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a
loss merely to get rid of her marya dmitrievna ordered almost the whole
trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the room
except natasha and then called her pet to her armchair
well now well talk i congratulate you on your betrothed youve
hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and ive known him since
he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground
natasha blushed happily i like him and all his family now listen you
know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his sons marrying the old
fellows crotchety of course prince andrew is not a child and can shift
without him but its not nice to enter a family against a fathers
will one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly youre a clever girl
and youll know how to manage be kind and use your wits then all will
natasha remained silent from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed but
really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he
loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her she
you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your
future sister in law husbands sisters bring up blisters but this
one wouldnt hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two together
tomorrow youll go with your father to see her be very nice and
affectionate to her youre younger than she when he comes hell find
you already know his sister and father and are liked by them am i right
next day by marya dmitrievnas advice count rostov took natasha to
call on prince nicholas bolkonski the count did not set out cheerfully
on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered the last
interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment
when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an
angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natasha
on the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest
spirits they cant help liking me she thought everybody always has
liked me and i am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to be
fond of him for being his father and of her for being his sister
that there is no reason for them not to like me
they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and entered
well the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half in
earnest but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering
the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and
when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning
the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announced
to the rostovs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess
begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors
was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter with
special politeness and showed them to the princess room the princess
looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meet
the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and
at ease from the first glance princess mary did not like natasha she
thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain she did
not at all realize that before having seen her future sister in law she
was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth and
happiness as well as by jealousy of her brothers love for her apart
from this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated just
then because on the rostovs being announced the old prince had shouted
that he did not wish to see them that princess mary might do so if she
chose but they were not to be admitted to him she had decided to
receive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in
some freak as he seemed much upset by the rostovs visit
there my dear princess ive brought you my songstress said the
count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
might appear i am so glad you should get to know one another very
sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace
remarks he rose if youll allow me to leave my natasha in your hands
for a quarter of an hour princess ill drive round to see anna
semenovna its quite near in the dogs square and then ill come back
the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his
daughter to give the future sisters in law an opportunity to talk to
one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of
encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention
this to his daughter but natasha noticed her fathers nervousness and
anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still
angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and
defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the
princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him
to stay longer at anna semenovnas and he departed
despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess mary who wished to
have a tte  tte with natasha mademoiselle bourienne remained in the
room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters
natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom
by her fathers nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess
who she thought was making a favor of receiving her and so everything
displeased her she did not like princess mary whom she thought very
plain affected and dry natasha suddenly shrank into herself and
involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary still
more after five minutes of irksome constrained conversation they
heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary
the door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a white
ah madam he began madam countess countess rostova if i am not
mistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not know
madam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with a
visit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you
to excuse me god is my witness i didnt know  he repeated
stressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do
i beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not know
muttered the old man and after looking natasha over from head to foot
mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the princes indisposition natasha
and princess mary looked at one another in silence and the longer they
did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew their
when the count returned natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened to
get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who
could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i couldnt begin
talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought natasha
the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew what
she ought to have said to natasha but she had been unable to say it
because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because without
knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage when
the count was already leaving the room princess mary went up hurriedly
to natasha took her by the hand and said with a deep sigh
natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why
dear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am glad
she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natasha noticed
i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said
with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking
what have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she was
they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day she sat
in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sonya
natasha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you it
but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i
dont talk about it natasha it wasnt your fault so why should you
natasha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her
i cant tell you i dont know no ones to blame said natasha its
my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why doesnt he come
she came in to dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew how the
prince had received the rostovs pretended not to notice how upset
natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and
that evening the rostovs went to the opera for which marya dmitrievna
natasha did not want to go but could not refuse marya dmitrievnas kind
offer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready dressed
into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror
there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but
o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but
differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply
embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching
inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i would
make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyes how i see those eyes
thought natasha and what do his father and sister matter to me i love
him alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile
manly and yet childlike no i had better not think of him not think
of him but forget him quite forget him for the present i cant bear
this waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she turned away from the
glass making an effort not to cry and how can sonya love nicholas so
calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought she
looking at sonya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her hand
natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at
once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of
love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside her
father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot
where she was going and with whom having fallen into the line of
carriages the rostovs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels
squeaking over the snow natasha and sonya holding up their dresses
jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and
passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers
they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes
through the closed doors the music was already audible
an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the
door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before
their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
at natasha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
played natasha smoothing her gown went in with sonya and sat down
scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not
experienced for a long time that of hundreds of eyes looking at her
bare arms and neck suddenly affected her both agreeably and
disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires and
the two remarkably pretty girls natasha and sonya with count rostov
who had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general
attention moreover everybody knew vaguely of natashas engagement to
prince andrew and knew that the rostovs had lived in the country ever
since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of
natashas looks as everyone told her had improved in the country and
that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty she
struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined
with her indifference to everything about her her black eyes looked at
the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to above
the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently
unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music
crumpling her program look theres alenina said sonya with her
dear me michael kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked the
look at our anna mikhaylovna what a headdress she has on
the karagins julie and boris with them one can see at once that
oh yes i heard it today said shinshin coming into the rostovs box
natasha looked in the direction in which her fathers eyes were turned
and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face
and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which natasha knew was
covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with
an ear to julies mouth was boris handsome smoothly brushed head he
looked at the rostovs from under his brows and said something smiling
they are talking about us about me and him thought natasha and he
no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they neednt trouble themselves
if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of them
behind them sat anna mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was
pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natasha knew so
well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all that
had been so humiliating in her mornings visit
what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh better
not think of it not till he comes back she told herself and began
looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls in
the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail
stood dolokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge
shock he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was
attracting everyones attention yet as much at ease as though he were
in his own room around him thronged moscows most brilliant young men
the count laughing nudged the blushing sonya and pointed to her former
do you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from he
asked turning to shinshin didnt he vanish somewhere
he did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away from
there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in
persia where he killed the shahs brother now all the moscow ladies
are mad about him its dolokhov the persian that does it we never
hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer him
to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dolokhov and anatole
a tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of
large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
and took a long time settling into her place
natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls
and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls
while natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
looked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and smiled
she was the countess bezukhova pierres wife and the count who knew
everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her
have you been here long countess he inquired ill call ill call
to kiss your hand im here on business and have brought my girls with
me they say semenova acts marvelously count pierre never used to
yes he meant to look in answered helene and glanced attentively at
wonderful answered natasha shes a woman one could easily fall in
just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls
as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and
all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the
women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with
eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look at it
the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some
painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth
stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red
bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
was glued they all sang something when they had finished their song
the girl in white went up to the prompters box and a man with tight
silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger
went up to her and began singing waving his arms about
first the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they
both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of
the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and
shouting while the man and woman on the stage who represented lovers
began smiling spreading out their arms and bowing
after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this
seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow the opera
nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the
queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in
that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent but
it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of the
audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
on the stage and expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned i
suppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking round in
turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude
women in the boxes especially at helene in the next box who
apparently quite unclothed sat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking
her eyes off the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded the
whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd natasha little by
little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she was
nor what was going on before her as she looked and thought the
strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her
mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and
singing the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch with
her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over to
at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door
leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostovs box creaked and
the steps of a belated arrival were heard theres kuragin whispered
shinshin countess bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer and
natasha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally
handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self assured yet
courteous bearing this was anatole kuragin whom she had seen and
noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an adjutants
uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained
swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good looking
and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good humored
complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked
deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly
jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked at
natasha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge
of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a
mais charmante said he evidently referring to natasha who did not
exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
beside dolokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
that dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily
smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen
how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and how
shinshin lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue
of kuragins in moscow and natasha tried to overhear it just because he
the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going
boris came to the rostovs box received their congratulations very
simply and raising his eyebrows with an absent minded smile conveyed to
natasha and sonya his fiancees invitation to her wedding and went
away natasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and
congratulated on his approaching wedding that same boris with whom she
had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in
the scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way and natasha
helenes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another
in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her
during the whole of that entracte kuragin stood with dolokhov in front
of the orchestra partition looking at the rostovs box natasha knew he
was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so
that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming
aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the
stalls the rostovs had not seen him since their arrival his face
looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natasha last saw him
he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to
him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostovs
box on seeing natasha pierre grew animated and hastily passing between
the rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on his
elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversing
with pierre natasha heard a mans voice in countess bezukhovas box and
something told her it was kuragin she turned and their eyes met almost
smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured
caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him
like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with
in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a
round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over
the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then
some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and
behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone
knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience
during this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she saw
anatole kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staring
at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did
not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it
when the second act was over countess bezukhova rose turned to the
rostovs box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old count
with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had entered
her box began talking to him with an amiable smile
do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she the
whole town is singing their praises and i dont even know them
natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased
by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure
i want to become a moscovite too now said helene how is it youre
not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country
countess bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
woman she could say what she did not think especially what was
dear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am not
staying here long this time nor are you i will try to amuse them i
have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know
you said she to natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile i had
heard about you from my page drubetskoy have you heard he is getting
married and also from my husbands friend bolkonski prince andrew
bolkonski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew of
his relation to natasha to get better acquainted she asked that one of
the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the
the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the
king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly
and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white
and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the
throne with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing the
queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare
legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then the
violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the
wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and
began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the
stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men went
into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra
struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
waved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty
thousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxes
and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the
man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men
and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the
sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm came
on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away
and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting duport duport duport natasha no longer thought this
strange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully
during the entracte a whiff of cold air came into helenes box the
door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush
let me introduce my brother to you said helene her eyes shifting
natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome
at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he
had long wished to have this happiness ever since the naryshkins ball
in fact at which he had had the well remembered pleasure of seeing her
kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men he
talked boldly and naturally and natasha was strangely and agreeably
struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about
whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was most
kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage
and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an old
familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you
ought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at the
karagins please come no really eh said he
while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face her
neck and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured
by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained and
oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking
at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should
look into hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she was
frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
always felt between herself and other men she did not know how it was
that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to
this man when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind
by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they spoke of most ordinary
things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had
ever been to any man natasha kept turning to helene and to her father
as if asking what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversation
with a general and did not answer her look and her fathers eyes said
nothing but what they always said having a good time well im glad
during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles prominent
eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natasha to break the
silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and
blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her
at first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant ce
sont les jolies femmes  isnt that so but now i like it very much
indeed he said looking at her significantly youll come to the
costume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to her
bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the prettiest
there do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge
natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt that
he was there behind so close behind her
how is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she asked
herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked
straight into his eyes and his nearness self assurance and the good
natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as he
was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horror
that no barrier lay between him and her
the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay natasha
went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the
world she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemed
quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
betrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not once
recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past
in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
down below that was the only part of the fourth act that natasha saw
she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whom
she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole
came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was
putting natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and
flushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyes
only after she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think over
what had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was
horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she
gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room
o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him she sat
for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize
what had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had
happened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure and
terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the bare
legged duport in a tinsel decorated jacket jumped about to the music
on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked helene
with her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravo there in the
presence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple but now
alone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was that
terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling
only to the old countess at night in bed could natasha have told all she
was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple views would
either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a
confession so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself
am i spoiled for andrews love or not she asked herself and with
soothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did happen
to me nothing i have done nothing i didnt lead him on at all nobody
will know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it is
plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and
andrew can love me still but why still o god why isnt he here
natasha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told her
that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the
former purity of her love for prince andrew had perished and again in
imagination she went over her whole conversation with kuragin and again
saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when
anatole kuragin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him
away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his
his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to
the commander in chief a post his father had procured for him and
would at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him
anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at pierres house
pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after a
while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave him
as shinshin had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had
turned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that he
slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french
actresses with the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to
be on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at danilovs or
other moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyone
else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society there
was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with a
few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried girls
especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was a
special reason for this as he had got married two years before a fact
known only to his most intimate friends at that time while with his
regiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had forced him to
marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for a
payment which he agreed to send to his father in law had arranged to be
free to pass himself off as a bachelor
anatole was always content with his position with himself and with
others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering
how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
that action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made
that it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend
thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
society he believed this so firmly that others looking at him were
persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in
society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
he was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was
not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still less could
he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father by
spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds he
was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he cared
about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there was
nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of
considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he
and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high
rakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar
to that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope of
forgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all will
dolokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and his
persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and
dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kuragin and made
anatole was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and audacity
dolokhov who needed anatole kuragins name position and connections
as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of him
and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it
apart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very process of
dominating anothers will was in itself a pleasure a habit and a
natasha had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after the
opera he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his
intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable
of considering what might come of such love making as he never had any
notion of the outcome of any of his actions
shes first rate my dear fellow but not for us replied dolokhov
i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said anatole eh
you know i adore little girls they lose their heads at once pursued
you have been caught once already by a little girl said dolokhov
well that cant happen twice eh said anatole with a good humored
the day after the opera the rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see
them marya dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they
concealed from natasha natasha guessed they were talking about the old
prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her she
was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come he had
not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow
to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince and
a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause she
continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
would happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him by
herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as she
began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess
mary of the theater and of kuragin mingled with her thoughts the
question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she
had not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she found
herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and
every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
feeling to the family natasha seemed livelier than usual but she was
on sunday morning marya dmitrievna invited her visitors to mass at her
parish church the church of the assumption built over the graves of
i dont like those fashionable churches she said evidently priding
herself on her independence of thought god is the same everywhere we
have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with
dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is there in giving
concerts in the choir i dont like it its just self indulgence
marya dmitrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them her whole
house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the
servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at
her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka
and roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was the
holiday so noticeable as in marya dmitrievnas broad stern face which
on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity
after mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where
the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant
announced that the carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna rose with a
stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and
announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkonski to have an
after she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppert roguet waited on
the rostovs and natasha very glad of this diversion having shut
herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying
on the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how
the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of
her fathers voice and anothers a womans that made her flush it was
helene natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door
opened and countess bezukhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a
high collar came into the room beaming with good humored amiable
oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing natasha charming no
this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to count rostov
who had followed her in how can you live in moscow and go nowhere no
i wont let you off mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight
and therell be some people and if you dont bring your lovely girls
who are prettier than mademoiselle george i wont know you my husband
is away in tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come you
she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied
respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the
looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she
did not cease chattering good naturedly and gaily continually praising
natashas beauty she looked at natashas dresses and praised them as
well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she had
received from paris and advised natasha to have one like it
but anything suits you my charmer she remarked
a smile of pleasure never left natashas face she felt happy and as if
she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezukhova who
had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now
so kind to her natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with this
woman who was so beautiful and so kind helene for her part was
sincerely delighted with natasha and wished to give her a good time
anatole had asked her to bring him and natasha together and she was
calling on the rostovs for that purpose the idea of throwing her
though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natasha for
drawing boris away she did not think of that now and in her own way
heartily wished natasha well as she was leaving the rostovs she called
my brother dined with me yesterday we nearly died of laughter he ate
nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite madly
how she blushes how she blushes my pretty said helene you must
certainly come if you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason
to shut yourself up even if you are engaged i am sure your fiance
would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death
so she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierre that good
pierre have talked and laughed about this so its all right and
again under helenes influence what had seemed terrible now seemed
simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind and
evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought natasha
gazing at helene with wide open wondering eyes
marya dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having
evidently suffered a defeat at the old princes she was still too
agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in
answer to the counts inquiries she replied that things were all right
and that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countess
bezukhovas visit and the invitation for that evening marya dmitrievna
i dont care to have anything to do with bezukhova and dont advise you
to however if youve promised go it will divert your thoughts she
count rostov took the girls to countess bezukhovas there were a good
many people there but nearly all strangers to natasha count rostov was
displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and
women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george was
standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men there
were several frenchmen present among them metivier who from the time
helene reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the count
decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and
to get away as soon as mademoiselle georges performance was over
anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostovs
immediately after greeting the count he went up to natasha and followed
her as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them
helene welcomed natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went
out of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people began
arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair for
natasha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never
lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her
mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl
draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and
assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible
mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her
son in some places she raised her voice in others she whispered
lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
adorable divine delicious was heard from every side
natasha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor
understood anything of what went on before her she only felt herself
again completely borne away into this strange senseless world so remote
from her old world a world in which it was impossible to know what was
good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole and
conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
how beautiful she is natasha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress
i dont think so when i look at you said anatole following natasha
he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you are
enchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceased
come come natasha said the count as he turned back for his
daughter how beautiful she is natasha without saying anything
stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess
the count wished to go home but helene entreated him not to spoil her
