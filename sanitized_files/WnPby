and having thus demolished the young man anna pavlovna turned to
another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians having
wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
i think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note that
had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the
french by wittgenstein the hero of petropol as he was then called in
what whats that asked anna pavlovna securing silence for the mot
and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch which
the emperor returns these austrian banners said bilibin friendly
banners gone astray and found on a wrong path and his brow became
the path to warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly and
unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meant
prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew no
more than the others what his words meant during his diplomatic career
he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
witty and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
that entered his head it may turn out very well he thought but if
not theyll know how to arrange matters and really during the
awkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic person
entered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert
and she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited prince
vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript
most gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasili sternly declaimed
looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had
anything to say to the contrary but no one said anything moscow our
ancient capital the new jerusalem receives her christ he placed a
sudden emphasis on the word her as a mother receives her zealous sons
into her arms and through the gathering mists foreseeing the brilliant
glory of thy rule sings in exultation hosanna blessed is he that
prince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice
bilibin attentively examined his nails and many of those present
appeared intimidated as if asking in what they were to blame anna
pavlovna whispered the next words in advance like an old woman
muttering the prayer at communion let the bold and insolent
let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass
the realms of russia with death bearing terrors humble faith the sling
of the russian david shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of god and
zealous champion of old of our countrys weal is offered to your
imperial majesty i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in
the sight of your most gracious presence i raise fervent prayers to
heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifully
what force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader and
animated by that address anna pavlovnas guests talked for a long time
of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the
result of the battle to be fought in a few days
you will see said anna pavlovna that tomorrow on the emperors
birthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment
anna pavlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the
service at the palace church in honor of the emperors birthday prince
volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
prince kutuzov it was kutuzovs report written from tatarinova on the
day of the battle kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a
step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he
was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
information it followed that there must have been a victory and at
once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creator
anna pavlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning a
joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory
to have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having been
captured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for
it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around
some particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based as
much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday as
on the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arranged
surprise mention was made in kutuzovs report of the russian losses
among which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov in
the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
centered round a single incident kutaysovs death everybody knew him
the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day
what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a loss
what did i tell about kutuzov prince vasili now said with a prophets
pride i always said he was the only man capable of defeating
but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
anxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
fancy the emperors position said they and instead of extolling
kutuzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the cause
of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasili no longer boasted of
his protege kutuzov but remained silent when the commander in chief was
mentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to make
petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news was
added countess helene bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible
malady it had been so agreeable to mention officially at large
gatherings everyone said that countess bezukhova had died of a terrible
attack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details were
mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had
prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect
but helene tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
that her husband to whom she had written that wretched profligate
pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
drug and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it
was said that prince vasili and the old count had turned upon the
italian but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate
deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop
talk in general centered round three melancholy facts the emperors
lack of news the loss of kutaysov and the death of helene
on the third day after kutuzovs report a country gentleman arrived from
moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through
the whole town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to be
in kutuzov was a traitor and prince vasili during the visits of
condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughters death said of
kutuzov whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in his
grief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expect
anything else from a blind and depraved old man
i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such
as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it
but the next day the following communication was received from count
prince kutuzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands
police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road he writes that he
is regretfully abandoning moscow sire kutuzovs action decides the
fate of the capital and of your empire russia will shudder to learn of
the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in
which lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall follow the army i have
had everything removed and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzov
prince michael ilarionovich since the twenty ninth of august i have
received no communication from you yet on the first of september i
received from the commander in chief of moscow via yaroslavl the sad
news that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you can
yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me and your silence
increases my astonishment i am sending this by adjutant general prince
volkonski to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons
that have induced you to take this melancholy decision
nine days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutuzov
reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event this
messenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know russian but who was
quoique etranger russe de coeur et dame  as he said of himself
 though a foreigner russian in heart and soul
the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
on stone island michaud who had never seen moscow before the campaign
and who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as he wrote when
he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain  with the news of the
burning of moscow dont les flammes eclairaient sa route 2
though the source of m michauds chagrin must have been different from
that which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when shown
into the emperors study that the latter at once asked
very sad sire replied michaud lowering his eyes with a sigh the
have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked the
michaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to him
which was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow and that
as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
moscow or losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose the
the emperor listened in silence not looking at michaud
has the enemy entered the city he asked
yes sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in flames
replied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he was
the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower lip
trembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes
but this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming
himself for his weakness and raising his head addressed michaud in a
i see colonel from all that is happening that providence requires
great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things to
his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the army when it saw
my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not notice
seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more michaud also
grew calm but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperors
direct and relevant question which required a direct answer
sire will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier he
colonel i always require it replied the emperor conceal nothing
from me i wish to know absolutely how things are
sire said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on his
lips having now prepared a well phrased reply sire i left the whole
army from its chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception in
how is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would
michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
sire he said with respectful playfulness they are only afraid lest
your majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow yourself to be
persuaded to make peace they are burning for the combat declared this
representative of the russian nation and to prove to your majesty by
the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are
ah said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gleam in his eyes
he patted michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease colonel
he bent his head and was silent for some time
well then go back to the army he said drawing himself up to his
full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture
and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of my
beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
my empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose said the
emperor growing more and more animated but should it ever be ordained
by divine providence he continued raising to heaven his fine eyes
shining with emotion that my dynasty should cease to reign on the
throne of my ancestors then after exhausting all the means at my
command i shall let my beard grow to here he pointed halfway down his
chest and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants rather
than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly
turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes
and went to the further end of his study having stood there a few
moments he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
with a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger
colonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we may
recall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the emperor
touching his breast we can no longer both reign together i have
learned to know him and he will not deceive me any more
when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in
the emperors eyes michaud quoique etranger russe de coeur et dame
at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard
as he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his own feelings
and those of the russian people whose representative he considered
sire said he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of
with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him
it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that
when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to
distant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for the
defense of the fatherland all russians from the greatest to the least
were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherland
or weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that time
without exception speak only of the self sacrifice patriotic devotion
despair grief and the heroism of the russians but it was not really
so it appears so to us because we see only the general historic
interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
that people had yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
public interest from being felt or even noticed most of the people at
that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
guided only by their private interests and they were the very people
whose activities at that period were most useful
those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take
part in it by self sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members
of society they saw everything upside down and all they did for the
common good turned out to be useless and foolish like pierres and
mamonovs regiments which looted russian villages and the lint the
young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so on
even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings
who discussed russias position at the time involuntarily introduced
into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the rule
forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially
applicable only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a part
in an historic event never understands its significance if he tries to
the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg and in
the provinces at a distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen in
militia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of
self sacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscow
there was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sight
of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they
thought about their next pay their next quarters of matreshka the
as the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostov took a close
and prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casually
without any aim at self sacrifice and he therefore looked at what was
going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his
brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the state of
russia he would have said that it was not his business to think about
it that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose but that he had
heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength that
fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being
so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple
as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being
sent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division not only without
regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but
with the greatest pleasure which he did not conceal and which his
a few days before the battle of borodino nicholas received the
necessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on in
advance he set out with post horses for voronezh
only a man who has experienced it that is has passed some months
continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war can understand the
delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
armys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals when free
from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camp he saw villages
with peasants and peasant women gentlemens country houses fields
where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
them he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what for
a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women young
and healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them women
too who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh
ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day very
clean shaven and in a full dress uniform he had not worn for a long
time went to present himself to the authorities
the commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who was
evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he received
nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military
and questioned him with an important air as if considering the general
progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
so nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him
from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor the governor
was a brisk little man very simple and affable he indicated the stud
farms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a horse
dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had
the best horses and promised to assist him in every way
you are count ilya rostovs son my wife was a great friend of your
mothers we are at home on thursdays today is thursday so please come
and see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of him
immediately on leaving the governors nicholas hired post horses and
taking his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop to the
landowner fourteen miles away who had the stud everything seemed to
him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezh
and as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind
the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old cavalryman a
horse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some century old brandy and
some old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and who
in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
thousand rubles to serve as he said as samples of his remounts after
dining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine nicholas
having exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already on
the friendliest terms galloped back over abominable roads in the
brightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be in
when he had changed poured water over his head and scented himself
nicholas arrived at the governors rather late but with the phrase
it was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew
that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the
clavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come as
provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual but with this
difference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
arrival of many wealthy families from moscow and as in everything that
went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable an
in for a penny in for a pound who cares spirit and the inevitable
small talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances
now turned on moscow the army and napoleon
the society gathered together at the governors was the best in
there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow
acquaintances but there were no men who could at all vie with the
cavalier of st george the hussar remount officer the good natured and
well bred count rostov among the men was an italian prisoner an
officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of that
prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the italian was
as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him that
everyone regarded the italian in the same light and he treated him
as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around him
a fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better late
than never and heard them repeated several times by others people
clustered around him all eyes turned on him and he felt at once that
he had entered into his proper position in the province that of a
universal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly so
after his long privations at posting stations at inns and in the
landowners snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice and
here too at the governors party there were as it seemed to nicholas
an inexhaustible number of pretty young women married and unmarried
impatiently awaiting his notice the women and girls flirted with him
and from the first day the people concerned themselves to get this
fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these
was the governors wife herself who welcomed rostov as a near relative
catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise and
dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial
society by his agility his particularly free manner of dancing even
surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he
danced that evening he had never danced like that in moscow and would
even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
bad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
something unusual something they would have to accept as the regular
thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces
all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blue eyed plump and
pleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officials
with the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other mens
wives were created for them rostov did not leave the ladys side and
treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as if
without speaking of it they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady
would get on together the husband however did not seem to share that
conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but the latters
good natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he
involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of the
evening however as the wifes face grew more flushed and animated the
husbands became more and more melancholy and solemn as though there
were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifes
nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closely
over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a
smile that never left his face jauntily shifting the position of his
legs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume and
admiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs in
their well fitting hessian boots nicholas told the blonde lady that he
wished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezh
a charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at his
partner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glanced
the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
ah nikita ivanych cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishing
nikita ivanych to share his joke he began to tell him of his intention
the husband smiled gloomily the wife gaily the governors good natured
wife came up with a look of disapproval
anna ignatyevna wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing the
name so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a very
important person come nicholas you know you let me call you so
anna ignatyevna malvintseva she has heard from her niece how you
i rescued such a lot of them said nicholas
her niece princess bolkonskaya she is here in voronezh with her aunt
very well very well oh what a fellow you are
the governors wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a
blue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with the most
important personages of the town this was malvintseva princess marys
aunt on her mothers side a rich childless widow who always lived in
voronezh when rostov approached her she was standing settling up for
the game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continued
to upbraid the general who had won from her
very pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand to
after a few words about princess mary and her late father whom
malvintseva had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knew
of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of hers the
important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to
nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention
of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear
when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the
dancing but the governors little wife placed her plump hand on his
sleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk with him led him to
her sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrew
so as not to be in her way
do you know dear boy began the governors wife with a serious
expression on her kind little face that really would be the match for
you would you like me to arrange it
i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovna
speaks of lily but i say no the princess do you want me to do it i
am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she is
really and she is not at all so plain either
not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits a
soldier aunt i dont force myself on anyone or refuse anything he
said before he had time to consider what he was saying
well then remember this is not a joke
yes yes the governors wife said as if talking to herself but my
dear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other the
blonde one is sorry for the husband really
oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity
of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to
himself might not be pleasant to someone else
but what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife thought
nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange a
match and sonya and on taking leave of the governors wife when
she again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew her
but see here to tell the truth aunt
what is it my dear come lets sit down here said she
nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
thoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or his
friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards
recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which
had very important results for him it seemed to him as it seems to
everyone in such cases that it was merely some silly whim that seized
him yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling events
had immense consequences for him and for all his family
you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the
very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me
oh yes i understand said the governors wife
but princess bolkonskaya thats another matter i will tell you the
truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her and
then after i met her under such circumstances so strangely the idea
often occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember that
mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet her
before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long
as my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of
the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen
that i should meet her just when natashas engagement had been broken
off and then everything so you see i never told this to anyone
you know sonya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her and
will do so so you see there can be no question about  said nicholas
my dear boy what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing and
you yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and what
about your mother it would kill her thats one thing and what sort of
life would it be for sonya if shes a girl with a heart your mother in
despair and you all ruined no my dear you and sonya ought to
nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments
all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a
short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is
now in mourning how can one think of it
but you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there is
always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife
what a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plump
on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov princess mary had
found her nephew there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew
giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh
that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her
fathers illness since his death and especially since her meeting with
rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about her
brother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending to
her nephews education she was sad now after a month passed in quiet
surroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which
was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated and
incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother
the only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed she was
worried too about her nephews education for which she had always felt
herself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace a
peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
the day after her party the governors wife came to see malvintseva and
after discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though under
present circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to be
thought of all the same the young people might be brought together and
could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and the
governors wife began to speak of rostov in marys presence praising
him and telling how he had blushed when princess marys name was
mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful
feeling her mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts
during the two days that elapsed before rostov called princess mary
continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decided
not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt that it
would not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitors
then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her then
it occurred to her that her aunt and the governors wife had intentions
concerning herself and rostov their looks and words at times seemed to
confirm this supposition then she told herself that only she with her
sinful nature could think this of them they could not forget that
situated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking
would be an insult to her and to her fathers memory assuming that she
did go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to
her and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed
undeservedly cold and then to mean too much more than anything she
feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
room that count rostov had called the princess showed no confusion
only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
you have met him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself to
understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural
when rostov entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for an
instant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then just
as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
with a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to him
and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the drawing
room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a
consummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
improved without my having noticed it and above all what tact and
had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she would
have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that
had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dear
loved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
speak and act apart from her own will from the time rostov entered her
face became suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindled
in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artistic
work on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaningless
was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first
time all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she had
lived appeared on the surface all her inward labor her dissatisfaction
with herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness her
meekness love and self sacrifice all this now shone in those radiant
eyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle face
rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he
felt that the being before him was quite different from and better
than anyone he had met before and above all better than himself
their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the
war and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about
it they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to change the
subject they talked of the governors kind wife of nicholas
she did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soon
as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of russias
misfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too near
her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas
noticed this as he noticed every shade of princess marys character
with an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed his
conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being
nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the
princess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought of
her but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all what
he had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at the
when a pause occurred during his short visit nicholas as is usual when
there are children turned to prince andrews little son caressing him
and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boy on his
knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a
softened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of
the man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as if
understanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society and
nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but all
the same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing on to
nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa
and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this
purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishops
though rostov told the governors wife that he would not make any
declaration to princess mary he promised to go
as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody
considered right was right so now after a short but sincere struggle
between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice and
in obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yielded
to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where he
knew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base to
declare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that he would never
act basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart
that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those
who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing
something very important more important than anything he had ever done
after meeting princess mary though the course of his life went on
externally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for him
and he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he had
thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in
society nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturously
thought about sonya he had pictured each of those young ladies as
almost all honest hearted young men do that is as a possible wife
adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a
white dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriage
little ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so on and
these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess
mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never
picture anything of future married life if he tried his pictures
seemed incongruous and false it made him afraid
the dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our losses in killed and
wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached
voronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of
her brothers wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of
him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself to
when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment
of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire for
vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh
suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an
indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard
seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs
and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became
unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster
a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which
nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory
he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects
when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to her
have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of
her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir
nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile
he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and
pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed
by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving
nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had
seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner
spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a
pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred
before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to
be prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or not
it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he
had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as
she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both
there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it is
that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living it
would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel
the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered
by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face
and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said
it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight
continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure
oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation
from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully
that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some
accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it
was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed
and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his
princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met
her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptional
circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as
a good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her
again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he
observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and
it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself
of chances of meeting her but that days encounter in church had he
felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale
sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures
and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to
see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not
like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the
depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why
am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and he
involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and
the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and
therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were
he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife
but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture
presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a
future with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it had
all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya but it was
impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not
reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them but to
dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening
how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in
her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure
her prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i want he
suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sonya
she was right he thought remembering what the governors wife had
said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grief
besides i dont love her not as i should o god release me from this
dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes
prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as
natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugar
and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i
am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in a
corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened
by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a
long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened
blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas
from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier has
nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the
other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened
sonyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and
reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again
and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders
stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed
what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear
him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it
had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he
this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter
from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate events
the loss of almost the whole of the rostovs moscow property and the
countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess
bolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had all
combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him
it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow
or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and my
love has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg
you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of
everything no one can love you more than does
