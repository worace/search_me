contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porters
stockings if you please stockings for my little girls who have none
so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now
the man looked at cosettes poor little red feet and continued
when will she have finished this pair of stockings
she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy
and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished
the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him
will you sell them for five francs went on the man
good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh
five francs the deuce i should think so five balls
yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair
of stockings for five francs we can refuse nothing to travellers
you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and
i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added
drawing a five franc piece from his pocket and laying it on the table
now i own your work play my child
the carter was so much touched by the five franc piece that he
but its true he cried examining it a real hind wheel and not
thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket
the thenardier had no reply to make she bit her lips and her face
in the meantime cosette was trembling she ventured to ask
play said the thenardier in a terrible voice
and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul
thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear
i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in
cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette
always moved as little as possible she picked up some old rags and her
little lead sword from a box behind her
eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just
executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the
cat they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was
the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its
contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps while
performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister
in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the
splendor of the butterflys wing vanishes when one essays to fix it
you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists
she cries she is warm see sister let us play with her she shall be
my little girl i will be a lady i will come to see you and you shall
look at her gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will
surprise you and then you will see her ears and then you will see her
tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and
i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl little girls are
in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and
to laugh at it until the ceiling shook thenardier accompanied and
as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of
anything which comes to hand while eponine and azelma were bundling up
the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she
laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep
the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one
of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to
clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a
little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something
is some one therein lies the whole womans future while dreaming and
chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little
gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the
young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman the first child
a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as
so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword
madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she
thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men
she came and set her elbows on the table
monsieur said she at this word monsieur the man turned up to that
time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme
you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more
repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child
should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you
are generous you see she has nothing she must needs work
then this child is not yours demanded the man
oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in
through charity a sort of imbecile child she must have water on the
brain she has a large head as you see we do what we can for her for
we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have
received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead
ah said the man and fell into his revery once more
her mother didnt amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned
during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some
instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the
thenardiers face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and
meanwhile the drinkers all three quarters intoxicated were repeating
their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and
wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced
the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter cosette
from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected
from her fixed eyes she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she
had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is
dead my mother is dead my mother is dead
on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire
decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier
the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the
all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight
of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat
and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table
then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and
cast her eyes slowly round the room madame thenardier was whispering to
her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing
with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not
a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out
from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no
one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized
it an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and
only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her
arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it
no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his
this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour
but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive
that one of the dolls legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth
lighted it up very vividly that pink and shining foot projecting from
the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine
the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take
eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and
let me alone said her mother what do you want
cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard
madame thenardiers countenance assumed that peculiar expression which
is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which
has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras
on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further
cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on
the doll belonging to these young ladies a czarina who should see
a muzhik trying on her imperial sons blue ribbon would wear no other
she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation
cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned
cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of
veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from
it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child
of that age she wrung them then not one of the emotions of the day
neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water
nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad
words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring
this from her she wept she burst out sobbing
meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet
what is the matter he said to the thenardier
dont you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti
that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch
all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play
she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her
will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier
the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out
as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give
cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud
the door opened again the man re appeared he carried in both hands the
fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats
had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in
it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had
spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that
toy shop lighted up by fire pots and candles so splendidly that it was
visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop
cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that
doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented
words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then
she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the
she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no
the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very
drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room
madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who
is that old fellow is he a poor man is he a millionaire perhaps he is
the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which
accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears
there in all its bestial force the tavern keeper stared alternately at
the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as
he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than
the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to
that machine costs at least thirty francs no nonsense down on your
gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess
well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be
sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women
the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said
thenardier with a caressing air take it it is yours
cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was
still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at
daybreak with strange beams of joy what she felt at that moment was
a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told
little one you are the queen of france
it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart
this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the
nevertheless the attraction carried the day she ended by drawing near
and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier
no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and
pardi cried the thenardier it is yours the gentleman has given it
truly sir said cosette is it true is the lady mine
the strangers eyes seemed to be full of tears he appeared to have
reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest
he should weep he nodded to cosette and placed the ladys hand in
cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched
her and began to stare at the floor we are forced to add that at that
moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled
round and seized the doll in a transport
it was an odd moment when cosettes rags met and clasped the ribbons and
madame she resumed may i put her on a chair
it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy
cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor
in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an
this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which
providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier
hated worse than any one in the world at that moment however it was
necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation
through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these
emotions were more than she could endure she made haste to send her
daughters to bed then she asked the mans permission to send cosette
off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal
air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms
from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where
her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with
her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not
old beast what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this
manner to want that little monster to play to give away forty franc
dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would a little
more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess
de berry is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old
why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him
it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her
play hes all right a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays
for it if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you if
he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for
the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of
the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful
attitude all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had
withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him
from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed
man who drew hind wheels from his pocket with so much ease and
who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was
certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared
many hours passed the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased
the drinkers had taken their departure the drinking shop was closed
the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still
remained in the same place and the same attitude from time to time he
changed the elbow on which he leaned that was all but he had not said
a word since cosette had left the room
the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in
is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the
thenardier when two oclock in the morning struck she declared herself
vanquished and said to her husband im going to bed do as you like
her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle
a good hour passed thus the worthy inn keeper had perused the courrier
francais at least three times from the date of the number to the
thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his
chair not a movement on the mans part is he asleep thought
thenardier the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him
at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and
not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to
repose smacked of luxury and respect these words possess the mysterious
and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day a
chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one
well said the stranger you are right where is your stable
sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir
he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and
thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of
rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained
it is really our bridal chamber said the tavern keeper my wife and
i occupy another this is only entered three or four times a year
i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly
thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark
he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the
chimney piece a very good fire was flickering on the hearth
on the chimney piece under a glass globe stood a womans head dress in
that sir said thenardier is my wifes wedding bonnet
the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say
there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden
thenardier lied however when he had leased this paltry building for
the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber
decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and
obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this
would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what
when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier
had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night
as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he
the inn keeper retired to his room his wife was in bed but she was not
asleep when she heard her husbands step she turned over and said to
do you know im going to turn cosette out of doors to morrow
they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle
as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a
corner the landlord once gone he threw himself into an arm chair and
remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes
took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and
quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of
something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase there he
heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he
followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under
the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was
nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all
sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a
bed if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes
as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the
pallet no sheets this was placed on the floor
the man approached and gazed down upon her
cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed in the winter
she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold
against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open
glittered in the dark from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as
though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost
convulsively in her arms beside her bed there was only one of her
a door which stood open near cosettes pallet permitted a view of a
rather large dark room the stranger stepped into it at the further
extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds
they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden
stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had
the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the
thenardier pair he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell
upon the fireplace one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is
always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are
so cold to look at there was no fire in this one there was not even
ashes but there was something which attracted the strangers gaze
nevertheless it was two tiny childrens shoes coquettish in shape
and unequal in size the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial
custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the
chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling
gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to
omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth
the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and
in each he saw a brand new and shining ten sou piece
the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing
when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight
of another object he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a
frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all
covered with ashes and dried mud it was cosettes sabot cosette with
that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never
discouraged had placed her shoe on the hearth stone also
hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and
the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis dor
then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf
on the following morning two hours at least before day break
thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern pen
in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat
his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following
him with her eyes they exchanged not a word on the one hand there was
profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which
one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind a
noise was audible in the house it was the lark sweeping the stairs
after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures
twenty three francs cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was
it was the accent of castlereagh auditing frances bill at the congress
monsieur thenardier you are right he certainly owes that murmured
the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the
presence of her daughters it is just but it is too much he will not
this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that
which was asserted in this manner must needs be so his wife did not
she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment
he went and seated himself in the chimney corner meditating with his
ah by the way resumed his wife you dont forget that im going to
turn cosette out of doors to day the monster she breaks my heart with
that doll of hers id rather marry louis xviii than keep her another
thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs
you will hand that bill to the man
hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered
thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in
the half open door visible only to his wife
the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand
up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already
as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an
embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard
face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and
to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor
the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent minded he
no i was passing through that is all what do i owe you madame he
the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill
the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were
madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil
so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing
she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone
oh monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in
the neighborhood all the people are poor you see if we had not now
and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should
not get along at all we have so many expenses just see that child is
why the little one you know cosette the lark as she is called
how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames she has more the
air of a bat than of a lark you see sir we do not ask charity and we
cannot bestow it we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal
the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths
monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money
and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other peoples
the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent
what if one were to rid you of her
the landladys red and violent face brightened up hideously
ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her
away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the
blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be
in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how
he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of
there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent
the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she
good gracious yes sir it is twenty three francs
the stranger laid five five franc pieces on the table
at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and
twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous
for his supper as for the child i must discuss that matter a little
madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected
lightning flashes of talent she was conscious that a great actor was
making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left
as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair
the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face
assumed a singular expression of good fellowship and simplicity
sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that
how strange it is one grows attached what money is that take back
your hundred sou piece i adore the child
eh our little cosette are you not intending to take her away from
us well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not
consent to it i shall miss that child i saw her first when she was a
tiny thing it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has
her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid
out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses
but one must do something for the good gods sake she has neither
father nor mother i have brought her up i have bread enough for
her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child you
understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort
of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is
quick tempered but she loves her also you see she is just the same as
our own child i want to keep her to babble about the house
the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter
excuse me sir but one does not give away ones child to a passer by
like that i am right am i not still i dont say you are rich you
have the air of a very good man if it were for her happiness but one
must find out that you understand suppose that i were to let her go
and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i
should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom
she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that
she may know that her good foster father is alive that he is watching
over her in short there are things which are not possible i do not
even know your name if you were to take her away i should say well
and the lark what has become of her one must at least see some
petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know
the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as
the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a
monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five
leagues from paris if i take cosette away i shall take her away and
that is the end of the matter you will not know my name you will not
know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is
that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives i break
the thread which binds her foot and she departs does that suit you
since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by
certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very
strong person it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his
clear and sagacious promptitude while drinking with the carters
smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had
devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him
like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him
both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through
instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so
doing not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the
yellow great coat had escaped him even before the stranger had so
clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his
purpose he had caught the old mans deep glances returning constantly
to the child who was this man why this interest why this hideous
costume when he had so much money in his purse questions which he put
to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he
had pondered it all night long he could not be cosettes father was he
her grandfather then why not make himself known at once when one has
a right one asserts it this man evidently had no right over cosette
what was it then thenardier lost himself in conjectures he caught
glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on
entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret
in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the
shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the strangers
clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in
so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak he had expected
nothing of the sort his conjectures were put to the rout he rallied
his ideas he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier
was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided
that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly
at that he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they
know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries
sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs
the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black
leather opened it drew out three bank bills which he laid on the
table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the
while this was taking place what had cosette been doing
on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe in it she had found the
gold piece it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new
twenty franc pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little
prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled her
destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was
she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though
she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed
whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of
fear she was happy above all she was stupefied such magnificent and
beautiful things did not appear real the doll frightened her the
gold piece frightened her she trembled vaguely in the presence of this
magnificence the stranger alone did not frighten her on the contrary
he reassured her ever since the preceding evening amid all her
amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little
childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who
was so rich and so kind everything had changed for her since she had
met that good man in the forest cosette less happy than the most
insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take
refuge under a mothers shadow and under a wing for the last five
years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had
shivered and trembled she had always been exposed completely naked
to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed
formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm cosette was no
longer afraid of the thenardier she was no longer alone there was some
she hastily set about her regular morning duties that louis which she
had about her in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen sou piece had
fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch
it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging
out if the truth must be told as she swept the staircase she paused
remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the
entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at
it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier
joined her she had gone in search of cosette at her husbands orders
what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an
an instant later cosette entered the public room
the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this
bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a
kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings shoes a complete outfit for a
my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself
daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who
had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a
little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms
pass along the road to paris they were going in the direction of livry
no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not
recognize her cosette was going away with whom she did not know
whither she knew not all that she understood was that she was leaving
the thenardier tavern behind her no one had thought of bidding her
farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one she was
poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour
cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing
at the sky she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron from
time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the
good man she felt something as though she were beside the good god
chapter x he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse
madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was
her wont she had expected great results when the man and cosette had
taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour
to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred
it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had
dared to criticise one of the masters acts
you are right in sooth said he i am a fool give me my hat
he folded up the three bank bills thrust them into his pocket and ran
out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first
some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again
the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he
followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself
that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal
first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then
fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness he would have given
fifteen thousand francs but i shall overtake him
