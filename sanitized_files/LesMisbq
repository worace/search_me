with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew white the day
which was slowly dawning cast a wan light on this swarming heap which
was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned
into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be
seven wagons were driving in a file along the road the first six were
singularly constructed they resembled coopers drays they consisted
of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear
extremities each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attached
to four horses harnessed tandem on these ladders strange clusters of
men were being drawn in the faint light these men were to be divined
rather than seen twenty four on each vehicle twelve on a side back to
back facing the passers by their legs dangling in the air this was
the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs
they had something which clanked and which was a chain and on their
necks something which shone and which was an iron collar each man had
his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty
men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk they were seized with
a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground
with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of millepeds
in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets
stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot the iron
necklets were square the seventh vehicle a huge rack sided baggage
wagon without a hood had four wheels and six horses and carried a
sonorous pile of iron boilers cast iron pots braziers and chains
among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at
full length and who seemed to be ill this wagon all lattice work
was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for
former punishments these vehicles kept to the middle of the road on
each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing
three cornered hats like the soldiers under the directory shabby
covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the
trousers of undertakers men half gray half blue which were almost
hanging in rags with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres
muskets and cudgels they were a species of soldier blackguards
these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the
authority of the executioner the one who appeared to be their chief
held a postilions whip in his hand all these details blurred by the
dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light
increased at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted
this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the
barrier the last was barely debauching from the boulevard a throng
sprung it is impossible to say whence and formed in a twinkling as
is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of
the road and looked on in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people
calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market gardeners hastening
the men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in
silence they were livid with the chill of morning they all wore linen
trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes the rest
of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness their accoutrements were
horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in
rags battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen nightcaps
and side by side with a short blouse a black coat broken at the elbow
many wore womens headgear others had baskets on their heads hairy
breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed
designs could be descried temples of love flaming hearts cupids
eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen two or three
had a straw rope attached to the cross bar of the dray and suspended
under them like a stirrup which supported their feet one of them held
in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance
of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing it was bread which
he was eating there were no eyes there which were not either dry
dulled or flaming with an evil light the escort troop cursed the men
in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of
a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder blades or
skulls some of these men were yawning their rags were terrible
their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed
together their fetters clanked their eyes glared ferociously their
fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the
rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter
this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful it
was evident that to morrow that an hour hence a pouring rain might
descend that it might be followed by another and another and that
their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these
men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again
get warm that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the
downpour that the water would fill their shoes that no lashes from
the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the
chain would continue to bind them by the neck that their legs would
continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight
of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of
autumn and delivered over to the rain to the blast to all the furies
blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men
who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon
and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with
suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient
burst forth and one would have said that it had set fire to all those
ferocious heads their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins
oaths and songs exploded the broad horizontal sheet of light severed
the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leaving feet and
wheels in the obscurity thoughts made their appearance on these faces
it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed
fierce souls laid bare though lighted up this wild throng remained in
gloom some who were gay had in their mouths quills through which they
blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated
these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows there
was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of
wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have
said that the suns brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the
lightning the wagon load which headed the line had struck up a song
and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality
a potpourri by desaugiers then famous called the vestal the trees
shivered mournfully in the cross lanes countenances of bourgeois
listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by
all sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos here were to
be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths
bald heads gray beards cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage
grins senseless attitudes snouts surmounted by caps heads like those
of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages
and by reason of that horrible thin skeleton faces to which death
alone was lacking on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave
in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains the
frightful leveller from below shame had passed over these brows at
that degree of abasement the last transformations were suffered by all
in their extremest depths and ignorance converted into dulness was
the equal of intelligence converted into despair there was no choice
possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the
mud it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that
unclean procession had not classified them these beings had been
fettered and coupled pell mell in alphabetical disorder probably and
loaded hap hazard on those carts nevertheless horrors when grouped
together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men
give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each dray load
had its own physiognomy by the side of the one where they were singing
there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging
one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load
menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent
as the tomb dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles
of hell on the march the march of the damned to their tortures
performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot
of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that on the gibbet
one of the guards who had a hook on the end of his cudgel made a
pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth
an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years
old and said to him rascal let that be a warning to you
as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the
captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful
dull and blind flogging which produced the sound of hail fell upon the
seven dray loads many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled
the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up a swarm of flies
jean valjeans eyes had assumed a frightful expression they were no
longer eyes they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the
glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious
of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of
catastrophes he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision
he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his
feet sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you
fast he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself
athwart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral
persecution signified and whence had come that pandemonium which was
pursuing him all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture
habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this
was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this
detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the
road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had
cosette was no less terrified but in a different way she did not
understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at
father what are those men in those carts
at that moment the cudgelling multiplied by a hundred hands became
zealous blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it it was a
perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous
obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting
it was the chain gang in fact which had set out before daybreak from
bicetre and had taken the road to mans in order to avoid fontainebleau
where the king then was this caused the horrible journey to last three
or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object
of sparing the royal personage a sight of it
jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed such encounters are
shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough
nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to
the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other
questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was
too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to
them but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to betake herself
to bed he heard her say in a low voice and as though talking to
herself it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my
pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at
fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day
there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fetes in
paris a review in the champ de mars jousts on the seine theatrical
performances in the champs elysees fireworks at the arc de letoile
illuminations everywhere jean valjean did violence to his habits and
took cosette to see these rejoicings for the purpose of diverting her
from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling
tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her
the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of
uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean donned his uniform of a
national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking
himself to shelter however this trip seemed to attain its object
cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom
moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion
with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout too
disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete so that
jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no
some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and
they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of
the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and
to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused
cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that
negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an
adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star
and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting
to the gentle glances of the tender old man she was picking a daisy
to pieces cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little
passionately etc who was there who could have taught her she was
handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that
to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart if there were a
fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air
of that grace jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those
tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance
emitted by that child a red breast was warbling in the thicket on one
side white cloudlets floated across the sky so gayly that one would
have said that they had just been set at liberty cosette went on
attentively tearing the leaves from her flower she seemed to be
thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something
charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the
delicate languor of a swan and said to jean valjean father what are
book fourth succor from below may turn out to be succor from on high
but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to
them which was to carry bread to those who were hungry and clothing
to those who were cold cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these
visits to the poor on which they recovered some remnants of their
former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good
one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many
little children cosette was rather merry in the evening it was at this
epoch that they paid their visit to the jondrette den
on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the
pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on
his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a
burn and which he explained in some way or other this wound resulted
in his being detained in the house for a month with fever he would not
call in a doctor when cosette urged him call the dog doctor said
cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and
such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt
all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and
he gazed at cosette saying oh what a kindly wound oh what a good
cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion
and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard
she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him
the books which he desired generally they were books of travel jean
valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these
ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger cosettes
coldness all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim he had
reached the point where he said to himself i imagined all that i am
his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the
thenardiers made in the jondrette hovel unexpected as it was had
after a fashion glided over him unnoticed he had succeeded in making
his escape all trace of him was lost what more did he care for he
only thought of those wretched beings to pity them here they are in
prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm
he thought but what a lamentable family in distress
as for the hideous vision of the barriere du maine cosette had not
sister sainte mechtilde had taught cosette music in the convent cosette
had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening
in the wounded mans humble abode she warbled melancholy songs which
spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year
you never go there i want you to stroll in it
and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the
garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who
was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went
when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was
convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a
contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally
had it come then it was in the month of march the days were growing
longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with it a
portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh
as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep
at times like the new born being that it is in that month nature
has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the
meadows and the flowers into the heart of man
cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that
april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself insensibly and
without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit
in spring sad souls grow light as light falls into cellars at midday
cosette was no longer sad however though this was so she did not
account for it to herself in the morning about ten oclock after
breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden
for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the
sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did
not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy
jean valjean intoxicated beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more
oh what a good wound he repeated in a whisper
his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls
it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that
fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some
chapter ii mother plutarque finds no difficulty in explaining a
one evening little gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered
that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming
tiresome he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper he
strolled out beyond the salpetriere into deserted regions that is
where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always
finds something he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the
in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden
haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that garden a passable
apple tree beside the apple tree stood a sort of fruit house which was
not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple one
apple is a supper one apple is life that which was adams ruin might
prove gavroches salvation the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved
lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the
garden was separated from it by a hedge
gavroche directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane he
recognized the apple tree he verified the fruit house he examined the
hedge a hedge means merely one stride the day was declining there was
not even a cat in the lane the hour was propitious gavroche began
the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused some one was
talking in the garden gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the
illustration succor from below 4b4 1 succor from below
a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side
exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have
been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and
on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman
was standing in front of him the old woman was grumbling gavroche who
mabeuf thought gavroche that name is a perfect farce
the old man who was thus addressed did not stir the old woman
the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind
mother plutarque began again and the old man was forced to accept the
in three months we shall owe him for four quarters
he says that he will turn you out to sleep
the green grocer insists on being paid she will no longer leave her
fagots what will you warm yourself with this winter we shall have no
the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more
that is quite right i do not digest meat well it is too heavy
the baker demands a settlement and says no money no bread
but monsieur we cant live like that without money
the old woman went away the old man remained alone he fell into
thought gavroche became thoughtful also it was almost dark
the first result of gavroches meditation was that instead of scaling
the hedge he crouched down under it the branches stood apart a little
come exclaimed gavroche mentally heres a nook and he curled up
in it his back was almost in contact with father mabeufs bench he
then by way of dinner he tried to sleep
it was a cat nap with one eye open while he dozed gavroche kept on
the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the lane formed a
livid line between two rows of dark bushes
all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance
one was in front the other some distance in the rear
the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and
thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was walking slowly
because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air
the second was straight firm slender it regulated its pace by that
of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait suppleness
and agility were discernible this figure had also something fierce and
disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called
an elegant the hat was of good shape the coat black well cut
probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist the head was
held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale
profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light the profile
had a rose in its mouth this second form was well known to gavroche it
he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a
one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with
the other gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events the
bedroom had turned into a hiding place at a very opportune moment
montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour in such a place betokened
something threatening gavroche felt his gamins heart moved with
what was he to do interfere one weakness coming to the aid of another
it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse gavroche did not
shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the
child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable
while gavroche was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and
hideously the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the
spider on the fly montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose bounded
upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him
and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream a moment later one of
these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee
of marble upon his breast only it was not just what gavroche had
expected the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who
was on top was the old man all this took place a few paces distant from
the old man had received the shock had returned it and that in such
a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed
he could not refrain from clapping his hands but it was applause
wasted it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they
were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle
silence ensued montparnasse ceased his struggles gavroche indulged in
the goodman had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to
his feet and gavroche heard him say to montparnasse
montparnasse rose but the goodman held him fast montparnasses
attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has
gavroche looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes
with his ears he was enjoying himself immensely
he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a
spectator he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed
from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent the goodman
you are strong and healthy why do you not work
speak seriously can anything be done for you what would you like to
a pause ensued the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought he
stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse
every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the
twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare he gave a jerk tried a
crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to
the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one
hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force
the old mans revery lasted for some time then looking steadily at
montparnasse he addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the
darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gavroche did not
my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most
laborious of lives ah you declare yourself to be an idler prepare to
toil there is a certain formidable machine have you seen it it is
the rolling mill you must be on your guard against it it is crafty

solved any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push and
there he is in the open air if you wish to go out you will be obliged
to pierce your wall what does every one who wants to step into the
street do he goes down stairs you will tear up your sheets little
by little you will make of them a rope then you will climb out of your
window and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss and
it will be night amid storm rain and the hurricane and if the rope
is too short but one way of descending will remain to you to fall to
drop hap hazard into the gulf from an unknown height on what on what
is beneath on the unknown or you will crawl up a chimney flue at the
risk of burning or you will creep through a sewer pipe at the risk of
drowning i do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask

locksmith if you wish to pass out you will be condemned to execute a
terrible work of art you will take a large sou you will cut it in
two plates with what tools you will have to invent them that is your
business then you will hollow out the interior of these plates taking
great care of the outside and you will make on the edges a thread so
that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover
the top and bottom thus screwed together nothing will be suspected to
the overseers it will be only a sou to you it will be a box what will
you put in this box a small bit of steel a watch spring in which you
will have cut teeth and which will form a saw with this saw as long
as a pin and concealed in a sou you will cut the bolt of the lock you
will sever bolts the padlock of your chain and the bar at your window
and the fetter on your leg this masterpiece finished this prodigy
accomplished all these miracles of art address skill and patience
executed what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you
are the author the dungeon there is your future what precipices are
idleness and pleasure do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy
resolution to live in idleness on the property of society to be
useless that is to say pernicious this leads straight to the depth
of wretchedness woe to the man who desires to be a parasite he will
become vermin ah so it does not please you to work ah you have but
one thought to drink well to eat well to sleep well you will drink
water you will eat black bread you will sleep on a plank with a fetter
whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long riveted to
your limbs you will break those fetters you will flee that is well
you will crawl on your belly through the brushwood and you will eat
grass like the beasts of the forest and you will be recaptured and
then you will pass years in a dungeon riveted to a wall groping for
your jug that you may drink gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness
which dogs would not touch eating beans that the worms have eaten
before you you will be a wood louse in a cellar ah have pity on
yourself you miserable young child who were sucking at nurse less
than twenty years ago and who have no doubt a mother still alive i
conjure you listen to me i entreat you you desire fine black cloth
varnished shoes to have your hair curled and sweet smelling oils on
your locks to please low women to be handsome you will be shaven
clean and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes you want rings
on your fingers you will have an iron necklet on your neck if you
glance at a woman you will receive a blow and you will enter there at
the age of twenty and you will come out at fifty you will enter young
rosy fresh with brilliant eyes and all your white teeth and your
handsome youthful hair you will come out broken bent wrinkled
toothless horrible with white locks ah my poor child you are on the
wrong road idleness is counselling you badly the hardest of all work
is thieving believe me do not undertake that painful profession of
an idle man it is not comfortable to become a rascal it is less
disagreeable to be an honest man now go and ponder on what i have said
to you by the way what did you want of me my purse here it is
and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the latters
hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to
slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical
all this having been said and done the goodman turned his back and
who was this goodman the reader has no doubt already divined
montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk
while the old man was walking away gavroche drew near
gavroche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that father mabeuf
was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep then the gamin
emerged from his thicket and began to crawl after montparnasse in the
dark as the latter stood there motionless in this manner he came up
to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand
into the back pocket of that frock coat of fine black cloth seized the
purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling
he slipped away like an adder through the shadows montparnasse who
had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the
first time in his life perceived nothing when gavroche had once more
attained the point where father mabeuf was he flung the purse over the
hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him
the purse fell on father mabeufs foot this commotion roused him
he bent over and picked up the purse
he did not understand in the least and opened it
the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small
m mabeuf in great alarm referred the matter to his housekeeper
that has fallen from heaven said mother plutarque
book fifth the end of which does not resemble the beginning
cosettes grief which had been so poignant and lively four or five
months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered
upon its convalescence nature spring youth love for her father
the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling
forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which
was so virgin and so young was the fire wholly extinct there or was
it merely that layers of ashes had formed the truth is that she hardly
felt the painful and burning spot any longer
one day she suddenly thought of marius why said she i no longer
that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with
a wasp like waist a delicious uniform the cheeks of a young girl a
sword under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed schapka passing the
gate moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes a round face
was vain insolent and good looking quite the reverse of marius he
had a cigar in his mouth cosette thought that this officer doubtless
belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone
on the following day she saw him pass again she took note of the hour
from that time forth was it chance she saw him pass nearly every day
the officers comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept
garden behind that malicious rococo fence a very pretty creature
who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant who is not
unknown to the reader and whose name was theodule gillenormand passed
see here they said to him theres a little creature there who is
have i the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who
this was at the precise moment when marius was descending heavily
towards agony and was saying if i could but see her before i
die had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment
gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and
marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in
sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into
cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal
phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself in which the isolated
heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling
as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the post of
a wine shop a rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be
she rich or poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances
are made in very high circles real misalliance is that of souls and as
many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune
is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand
ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who
has polished boots and varnished words if looked at not outside but
inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a
block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the
what did cosettes soul contain passion calmed or lulled to sleep
something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy
lower down the image of the handsome officer was reflected in
the surface did a souvenir linger in the depths quite at the
during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey this
as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals
he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost where did he go no
one knew not even cosette once only on the occasion of one of these
departures she had accompanied him in a hackney coach as far as a
little blind alley at the corner of which she read impasse de la
planchette there he alighted and the coach took cosette back to the
rue de babylone it was usually when money was lacking in the house that
so jean valjean was absent he had said i shall return in three days
that evening cosette was alone in the drawing room in order to get
rid of her ennui she had opened her piano organ and had begun to sing
accompanying herself the while the chorus from euryanthe hunters
astray in the wood which is probably the most beautiful thing in all
the sphere of music when she had finished she remained wrapped in
all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in
it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint
she was in bed and it was ten oclock at night
she stepped to the shutter of the drawing room which was closed and
it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking
she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a
small wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden the moon was at
the full everything could be seen as plainly as by day
she opened the window the garden was absolutely calm and all that was
visible was that the street was deserted as usual
cosette thought that she had been mistaken she thought that she had
heard a noise it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and
magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified
depths which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest and in which
one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the
huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight
moreover cosette was not very timid by nature there flowed in her
veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs
barefoot it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove
there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her
on the following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was
strolling in the garden in the midst of the confused thoughts which
occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar
to that of the preceding evening as though some one were walking
beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told
herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the
friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she
paid no heed to it besides she could see nothing
she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to
the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosettes shadow in
front of her upon this lawn as she came out from the shrubbery
beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another
shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which
it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of
the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette
she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or
then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely
she glanced on the ground the figure had disappeared
she re entered the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as
she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror was this another
hallucination what two days in succession one hallucination might
pass but two hallucinations the disquieting point about it was that
the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom phantoms do not wear round
on the following day jean valjean returned cosette told him what she
thought she had heard and seen she wanted to be reassured and to see
her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose
he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw
during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly
heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window
she ran to her little wicket and opened it in point of fact there
was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand just as she
was about to scream the moon lighted up the mans profile it was her
father she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy
jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the
garden cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter
on the third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise
later at one oclock in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst
of laughter and her fathers voice calling her
she jumped out of bed threw on her dressing gown and opened her
her father was standing on the grass plot below
i have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look
there is your shadow with the round hat
and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and
which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man
wearing a round hat it was the shadow produced by a chimney pipe of
sheet iron with a hood which rose above a neighboring roof
cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were
allayed and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father
she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron
jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did
not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney pot was
really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she
had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky
she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney pot
which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when some
one looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette
had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this
cosettes serenity was fully restored the proof appeared to her to
be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether there could
possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at
a few days later however a fresh incident occurred
in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench
screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke elms
but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the
one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out
cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown the breeze was
blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an objectless
sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible
sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows
from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour
