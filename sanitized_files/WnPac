with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently
alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be
her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a
joyful but an animal squirrel like expression she paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the
i still cant understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew
slowly not taking his eyes off his wife
the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair
no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have
your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you
the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered
prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room
pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and
now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind
why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little
princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so
to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no
lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an
entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words but she went on hurriedly
you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave
lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically
pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself
calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i
myself have experienced and so because no excuse me an
outsider is out of place here no dont distress yourself good
no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the
no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without
lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which
suddenly the angry squirrel like expression of the princess pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timid
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand
she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead
good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as
the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre
continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead
let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door
they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room
everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore
that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married
halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and
with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on
his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind
never never marry my dear fellow thats my advice never marry till
you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and
until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her
plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is
good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles
yes yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you marry
expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room
where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot but whats the good and he waved his arm
pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and
the good natured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend
my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those
rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but o god what would i not
give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i
as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who
had lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with half closed eyes had
uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face
was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire
of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it
was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more
impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation
you dont understand why i say this he continued but it is the
whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he
though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he
worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing
but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a
woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you
have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are
the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war
the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for
nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince
andrew and at anna pavlovnas they listen to me and that stupid set
without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew
what those society women are and women in general my father is right
selfish vain stupid trivial in everything thats what women are when
you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it
seems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothing
nothing no dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded prince
it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider
yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything
he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future
how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a
model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest
degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best
described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince
andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory
his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had
an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and
study and if pierre was often struck by andrews lack of capacity for
philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly
addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of
even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise
and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels
my part is played out said prince andrew whats the use of talking
about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at
that smile was immediately reflected on pierres face
but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into
a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly
blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say
this without a name and without means and it really but he did
not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all
right only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted to
prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and
affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority
i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our
whole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all the
same youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting
those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all
this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it
what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his
i dont understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il
faut thats a different matter but the kuragins set of women women
pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing the dissipated
life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by
do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought
seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i
cant decide or think properly about anything ones head aches and one
spends all ones money he asked me for tonight but i wont go
you give me your word of honor not to go
it was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless
northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive
straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the
impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to
see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or
evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin
was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there
was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre
i should like to go to kuragins thought he
but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go
there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his
promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he
had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides
thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no
definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may
be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of
this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to
reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which
anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs
and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty
bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of
alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance
cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed
pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the
remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of
laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and
general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others
i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one
i bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our hands
there leave bruin alone heres a bet on
at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth
jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who
stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen
shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is petya
another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring
cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an
officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who
was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily
wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a
glass from the table he went up to pierre
pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at
the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening
to their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierres glass while
explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval
officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out
go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last
no i wont said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the
dolokhov was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to
dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and light blue eyes he
was about twenty five like all infantry officers he wore no mustache
so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly
seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually
round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute
insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it
impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and
no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles
dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that
all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than
they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won
however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin
and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces
the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to
smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but
could not move it he smashed a pane
you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre
pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with
take it right out or theyll think im holding on said dolokhov
is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole
first rate said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum
in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky
the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible
dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window
sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the
i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might
understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty
imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing
all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this
spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window
and without holding on to anything is that right
anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of
his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in english
wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to
attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the
same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand
the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he
kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating
dolokhovs words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life
guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill
oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of
shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad
jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs
placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily
dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his
legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on
his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the
left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed
them on the window sill though it was already quite light dolokhovs
back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both
sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre
stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present
suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize
i say this is folly hell be killed said this more sensible man
dont touch him youll startle him and then hell be killed eh
dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged
if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately
through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now
saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand
to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from dolokhovs back anatole stood erect with staring eyes
the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had
wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself
on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a
faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and
fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov
still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back
till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the
bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the
bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head
tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed
to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a
backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this
was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping
ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more
with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but
refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he
would never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around
he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but
he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov
well done fine fellow theres a bet for you devil take
the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money
dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window
gentlemen who wishes to bet with me ill do the same thing he
suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a
let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling
what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go
giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices
ill drink it lets have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the
table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out
they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who
no youll never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and
ill get round him listen ill take your bet tomorrow but now we
come on then cried pierre come on and well take bruin with
and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground
and began dancing round the room with it
prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who
had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna
pavlovnas soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception
made and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the
rank of cornet he received however no appointment to kutuzovs staff
despite all anna mikhaylovnas endeavors and entreaties soon after anna
pavlovnas reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went
straight to her rich relations the rostovs with whom she stayed when
in the town and where her darling bory who had only just entered a
regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as
a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and
her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them
it was st natalias day and the name day of two of the rostovs the
mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly ever since the
morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually bringing visitors to the countess rostovas big house on
the povarskaya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and
her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in
the countess was a woman of about forty five with a thin oriental type
of face evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve a
languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikhaylovna
drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young
people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw
i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chere he called
everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his
tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rank i thank
you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping
but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chere on behalf
of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he
repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same
expression on his full cheerful clean shaven face the same firm
pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he
had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the
drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out
his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who
enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity
offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health
sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but self confident
french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment
of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray
hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his
way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and
pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set
out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in
silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he
would call dmitri vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of
all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
would say well dmitri youll see that things are all as they should
be thats right the great thing is the serving thats it and with a
complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room
marya lvovna karagina and her daughter announced the countess
gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the
countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with
im quite worn out by these callers however ill see her and no more
she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice
as if saying very well finish me off
a tall stout and proud looking woman with a round faced smiling
daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling
dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child at
the razumovskis ball and countess apraksina i was so
delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping
of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until
at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i
am so delighted mammas health and countess apraksina and
then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles
and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the
illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherines day count
bezukhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved
i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad
health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him
what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the
visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of
thats what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it
seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things
that he has been expelled by the police
he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince
vasilis son he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to
heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dolokhov has
been degraded to the ranks and bezukhovs son sent back to moscow
anatole kuragins father managed somehow to get his sons affair hushed
up but even he was ordered out of petersburg
but what have they been up to asked the countess
they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor
he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but
there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a
carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried
to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and
the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there
was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back
what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the
oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count
yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing
it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the
visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich bezukhovs son who
amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well
educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for
him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his
money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have
why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning
away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his
children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate
the visitor made a gesture with her hand
i should think he has a score of them
princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently
wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half
whisper everyone knows count cyrils reputation he has lost count
of his children but this pierre was his favorite
how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the
countess i have never seen a handsomer man
he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was
saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count
is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the
emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is so ill
that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg
no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince
vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very
well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is
my mothers second cousin hes also my borys godfather she added as
if she attached no importance at all to the fact
prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some
yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the
fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he
but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and
seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young
ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut
and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form
again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats
well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he
silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably but
not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now
rose and took their leave the visitors daughter was already smoothing
down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from
the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the
door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and
stopped short in the middle of the room it was evident that she had not
intended her flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorway
appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the guards
a girl of fifteen and a plump rosy faced boy in a short jacket
the count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide
and threw them round the little girl who had run in
ah here she is he exclaimed laughing my pet whose name day it is
ma chere there is a time for everything said the countess with
feigned severity you spoil her ilya she added turning to her
how do you do my dear i wish you many happy returns of your name
day said the visitor what a charming child she added addressing
this black eyed wide mouthed girl not pretty but full of life with
childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice
with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace
frilled drawers and feet in low slippers was just at that charming age
when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young
woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the
lace of her mothers mantilla not paying the least attention to her
severe remark and began to laugh she laughed and in fragmentary
sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the
do you see my doll mimi you see was all natasha managed
to utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against her mother
and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim
now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother
pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the
visitor she added she is my youngest girl
natasha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla
glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face
the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it
tell me my dear said she to natasha is mimi a relation of yours a
natasha did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish
things she did not reply but looked at her seriously
meanwhile the younger generation boris the officer anna mikhaylovnas
son nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldest son sonya the
counts fifteen year old niece and little petya his youngest boy had
all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to
restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that
shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which they
had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing
than the drawing room talk of society scandals the weather and
countess apraksina now and then they glanced at one another hardly
the two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood
were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boris
was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate
features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression
dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face
expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered
the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say but
failed boris on the contrary at once found his footing and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was
still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged
during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked
right across the skull having said this he glanced at natasha she
turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was
screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to
control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris did not laugh
you were meaning to go out werent you mamma do you want the
carriage he asked his mother with a smile
yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning
boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plump boy
ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been
the only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the
young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years
older than her sister and behaved already like a grown up person were
nicholas and sonya the niece sonya was a slender little brunette with
a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black
plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion
and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular
arms and neck by the grace of her movements by the softness and
flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of
manner she reminded one of a pretty half grown kitten which promises
to become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper to
show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of
herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who
was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that
her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was
clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like
natasha and boris escape from the drawing room
ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing
to nicholas his friend boris has become an officer and so for
friendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old father
and entering the military service my dear and there was a place and
everything waiting for him in the archives department isnt that
friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone
but they say that war has been declared replied the visitor
theyve been saying so a long while said the count and theyll say
so again and again and that will be the end of it my dear theres
friendship for you he repeated hes joining the hussars
the visitor not knowing what to say shook her head
its not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from friendship
at all i simply feel that the army is my vocation
he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both
schubert the colonel of the pavlograd hussars is dining with us
today he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him
it cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him
i have already told you papa said his son that if you dont wish
to let me go ill stay but i know i am no use anywhere except in the
army i am not a diplomat or a government clerk i dont know how to
hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness
of a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitor
the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment
to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature
all right all right said the old count he always flares up this
buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose
from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he added
the elders began talking about bonaparte julie karagina turned to young
what a pity you werent at the arkharovs on thursday it was so dull
without you said she giving him a tender smile
the young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
smile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
of sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk
he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on
her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animation
vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then
with a distressed face left the room to find sonya
how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves
said anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out cousinage
yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had
brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no
one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them
now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is
always always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both
it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor
yes youre quite right continued the countess till now i have
always thank god been my childrens friend and had their full
confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who
imagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shall
always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with his
impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he will
all the same never be like those petersburg young men
yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who
always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that
everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar whats one
what a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a
yes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and what a
voice she has though shes my daughter i tell the truth when i say
shell be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to
isnt she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to train it
oh no not at all too young replied the count why our mothers used
and shes in love with boris already just fancy said the countess
with a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidently concerned
with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to be
severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up
to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is i
know every word she utters she will come running to me of her own
accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her but
really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricter
yes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder
but the smile did not enhance veras beauty as smiles generally do on
the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant
expression vera was good looking not at all stupid quick at learning
was well brought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true
and appropriate yet strange to say everyone the visitors and
countess alike turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said
people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make
whats the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was too
clever with vera said the count well what of that shes turned out
splendidly all the same he added winking at vera
the guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner
what manners i thought they would never go said the countess when
when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation
in the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was already
growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming
at once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching
neither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among the
boris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little
dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined
his handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambush
waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the
glass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about to
call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she
hardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and muttering
angrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulse to
run out to her and remained in her hiding place watching as under an
invisible cap to see what went on in the world she was experiencing a
new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herself kept looking
round toward the drawing room door it opened and nicholas came in
sonya what is the matter with you how can you said he running up
its nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonya
well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her
so o onya look here how can you torture me and yourself like that
for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand
sonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirring
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes
sonya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything
said nicholas and i will prove it to you
i dont like you to talk like that
well then i wont only forgive me sonya he drew her to him and
oh how nice thought natasha and when sonya and nicholas had gone
out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her
boris come here said she with a sly and significant look i have
something to tell you here here and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding
she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown
down on one of the tubs picked it up
boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not
dont you want to well then come here said she and went further
in among the plants and threw down the doll closer closer she
she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and
and me would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly
glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from
how funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still
suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so
that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing
back her hair kissed him full on the lips
then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
