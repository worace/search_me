the aide de camp who had opened the ball and several other young men
so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners to
sonya she did not cease dancing all the evening she noticed and saw
nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she fail to notice
that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador and how
particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince so and so
and so and so did and said this and that and that helene had great
success and was honored by the special attention of so and so but she
did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone because
the ball became livelier after his departure for one of the merry
cotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner he
reminded her of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her natasha blushed at that recollection
and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be
ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard
like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting
someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was
natasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her
mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care and
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the
cotillion having completed one of the figures natasha still out of
breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she was
tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately
put her hand gaily on the mans shoulder smiling at prince andrew
id be glad to sit beside you and rest im tired but you see how they
keep asking me and im glad of it im happy and i love everybody and
you and i understand it all and much much more was said in her smile
when her partner left her natasha ran across the room to choose two
if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be
my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as he
watched her she did go first to her cousin
what rubbish sometimes enters ones head thought prince andrew but
what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she
wont be dancing here a month before she will be married such as she
are rare here he thought as natasha readjusting a rose that was
slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him
when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not answer at
once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how can
i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince
andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had
ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes
completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absent minded a
deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared
on her way to supper natasha passed him
pierres gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of him
she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
how delightful it is count said she isnt it
pierre smiled absent mindedly evidently not grasping what she said
how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha
especially such a capital fellow as bezukhov in natashas eyes all
the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people
loving one another none of them capable of injuring another and so
next day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell
on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes that
little rostova is very charming theres something fresh original un
petersburg like about her that distinguishes her that was all he
thought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea he set to
but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill disposed for work
and could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as he
often did and was glad when he heard someone coming
the visitor was bitski who served on various committees frequented all
the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideas
and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of those men
who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion
but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardly
had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince andrews room with a
preoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particulars
of that mornings sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor
and he spoke of it enthusiastically the emperors speech had been
extraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs
deliver the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are
estates of the realm he said that the government must rest not on
authority but on secure bases the emperor said that the fiscal system
must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitski
emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly
ah yes todays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our
prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of
state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had
taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he
listened with quiet irony to bitskis enthusiastic account of it a very
simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to bitski
what the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that make me
and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince
andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that
evening at speranskis with only a few friends as the host had said
when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home
circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew
especially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domestic
surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it
at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speranski
owned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this small
house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a
monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly
gathering of speranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled at
five oclock there were no ladies present except speranskis little
daughter long faced like her father and her governess the other
guests were gervais magnitski and stolypin while still in the
anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh a
laugh such as one hears on the stage someone it sounded like
speranski was distinctly ejaculating ha ha ha prince andrew had never
before heard speranskis famous laugh and this ringing high pitched
laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him
he entered the dining room the whole company were standing between two
windows at a small table laid with hors doeuvres speranski wearing a
gray swallow tail coat with a star on the breast and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his
guests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski was
relating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at what
magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room
magnitskis words were again crowned by laughter stolypin gave a deep
bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughed
softly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a high pitched staccato
still laughing speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew
very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on
turning to magnitski and interrupting his story we have agreed that
this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and
turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh
prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment
regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not
speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared
mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and
at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitski
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state
service related to people in the service it seemed that in this
company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
ridicule speranski related how at the council that morning a deaf
dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too
gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into the
conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn to
the conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about his
vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its
evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in
a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to
enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince
andrew mirthless and tiresome speranskis high pitched voice struck him
unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being
out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay
he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could
there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and
might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the
salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed
after dinner speranskis daughter and her governess rose he patted the
little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture too
the men remained at table over their port english fashion in the midst
of a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish affairs
which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a
contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent
the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had
no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were
having sat some time at table speranski corked a bottle of wine and
remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it
to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went
into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to
speranski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the room
the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly
now for the recitation said speranski on returning from his study a
wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediately
assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which
he had composed about various well known petersburg people he was
interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished
prince andrew went up to speranski and took his leave
where are you off to so early asked speranski
they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike
impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
expected anything from speranski and from any of his own activities
connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what
speranski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince
andrews ears long after he had left the house
when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in
petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he
recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project
of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they
were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor
one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought
of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered
how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and
promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded he
recalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had
translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian and
he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself
bogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryazan he
remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentally
applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he
felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before
and among them at the rostovs with whom he had renewed acquaintance at
the ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such a
pleasant impression on his mind in her own home
natasha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a dark blue
house dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in her
ball dress she and all the rostov family welcomed him as an old friend
simply and cordially the whole family whom he had formerly judged
severely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindly
people the old counts hospitality and good nature which struck one
especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince
andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes he thought they are
capital people who of course have not the slightest idea what a
treasure they possess in natasha but they are kindly folk and form the
best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl
in natasha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world that
in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
already begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him no
longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it
after dinner natasha at prince andrews request went to the clavichord
and began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies
and listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and
suddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible for
him he looked at natasha as she sang and something new and joyful
stirred in his soul he felt happy and at the same time sad he had
absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what about
his former love the little princess his disillusionments his hopes
for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vivid
sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and
illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he
and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while
as soon as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
liked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling that
she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and said he
liked her singing as he liked everything she did
prince andrew left the rostovs late in the evening he went to bed from
habit but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit his candle
he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubled
by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had
stepped out of a stuffy room into gods own fresh air it did not enter
his head that he was in love with natasha he was not thinking about
her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all life
appeared in a new light why do i strive why do i toil in this narrow
confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to me
said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while he
began making happy plans for the future he decided that he must attend
to his sons education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his
charge then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see
england switzerland and italy i must use my freedom while i feel so
much strength and youth in me he said to himself pierre was right
when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order
to be happy and now i do believe in it let the dead bury their dead
but while one has life one must live and be happy thought he
one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in
moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate
brand new uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair
i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she
could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate
what is it you wish colonel i am at your service
i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this with
perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable
and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wifes
friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the
countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper
only countess helene considering the society of such people as the
bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation
berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though
he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared
to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre could
but dont be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to
eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he is
very good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me the
contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the
bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight
having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were ready
in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures
and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in
his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then
you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i
managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years
but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only
waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to
be your husband he rose and kissed veras hand and on the way to her
straightened out a turned up corner of the carpet and how have i
obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it
goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical
berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and
paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a mans dignity
what it was ein mann zu sein  vera at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the
same understood life wrongly as according to vera all men did berg
judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera judging
only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed
that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and
berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace
fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the
the only thing is we mustnt have children too soon he continued
yes answered vera i dont at all want that we must live for
princess yusupova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing to
the fichu with a happy and kindly smile
just then count bezukhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one
another both smiling with self satisfaction and each mentally claiming
this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg
this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself
but please dont interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said
vera because i know what interests each of them and what to say to
it cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation
they received pierre in their small new drawing room where it was
impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry
neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself and berg and vera immediately began their evening
party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
vera having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertained
with conversation about the french embassy at once began accordingly
berg having decided that masculine conversation was required
interrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the war
with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to
personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the
austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though the
conversation was very incoherent and vera was angry at the intrusion of
the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction
that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very
well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its
before long boris bergs old comrade arrived there was a shade of
condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and vera after
boris came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the
rostovs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
evening parties berg and vera could not repress their smiles of
satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at
the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the
bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it
especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the
shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
the table for boston the general sat down by count ilya rostov who was
next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with the
old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere
pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with
count rostov the general and the colonel at the card table he
happened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a curious
change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not
only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by
her look of gentle indifference to everything around
whats the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was
sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking
at him made some reply to boris who sat down beside her after playing
out a whole suit and to his partners delight taking five tricks
pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the
room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at natasha
what has happened to her he asked himself with still greater
prince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a
look of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking up
at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing and
the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
again become what she had been at the ball
prince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new and
pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with
his back to natasha and now facing her but during the whole of the six
something very important is happening between them thought pierre
and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him
after six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing
like that and pierre was released natasha on one side was talking with
sonya and boris and vera with a subtle smile was saying something to
prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they
were talking secrets sat down beside them vera having noticed prince
andrews attentions to natasha decided that at a party a real evening
party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversation
with him about feelings in general and about her sister with so
intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she felt
that she had to employ her diplomatic tact
when pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being carried away
by her self satisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a
what do you think vera was saying with an arch smile you are so
discerning prince and understand peoples characters so well at a
glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in her
attachments could she like other women vera meant herself love a
man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i consider
i know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic
smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able to
solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the less
attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added
and looked up at pierre who was just approaching them
yes that is true prince in our days continued vera mentioning
our days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing
imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of
our days and that human characteristics change with the times in our
days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often
stifles real feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie is
very susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused prince
andrew to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but vera
i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but till
quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know count
she said to pierre even our dear cousin boris who between ourselves
was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of
you are friendly with boris arent you asked vera
i expect he has told you of his childish love for natasha
oh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew blushing
yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le
cousinage est un dangereux voisinage  dont you think so
oh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnatural
liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful
with his fifty year old moscow cousins and in the midst of these
jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside
well asked pierre seeing his friends strange animation with
surprise and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rose
i must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you know
that pair of womens gloves he referred to the masonic gloves given
to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved i
but no i will talk to you later on and with a strange light in his
eyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached natasha
and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked her
something and how she flushed as she replied
but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he
should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his face
the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen
everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the general
raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes
only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
parties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversation
among the men and a dispute about something important and clever now
the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it
next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the
rostovs and spent the rest of the day there
everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and
without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not only in
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha but in the
whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
at prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started some
artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way
sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way when
she was with them natasha grew pale in a panic of expectation when
she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by
his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to
mamma for heavens sake dont ask me anything now one cant talk
but all the same that night natasha now agitated and now frightened
lay a long time in her mothers bed gazing straight before her she told
her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad
asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had
but such a such a never happened to me before she said only i
feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when im with him what
does that mean does it mean that its the real thing yes mamma are
no my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now go
all the same i shant sleep what silliness to sleep mummy mummy
such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised and
alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we ever
it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew
at otradnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she feared
this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding
him as it seemed not indifferent to her
and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while
we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball it
is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this already
then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar
what else did he say to you what are those verses read them said
her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew had
mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower
dont natasha pray to god marriages are made in heaven said her
darling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried natasha shedding
tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother
at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him
of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife
that day countess helene had a reception at her house the french
ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late
become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and
gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and
struck everyone by his preoccupied absent minded and morose air
since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of his
wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made a
gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel
oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity
of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time
the feeling he had noticed between his protegee natasha and prince
andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
and his friends he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife and
about natasha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him
insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what
presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic
labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward
midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction
of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrew
ah its you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air and
i you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with that
air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at
prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on
his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look
smiled at him with the egotism of joy
well dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it yesterday
and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything like it
suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
yes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it but
the feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself and
suffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in the
world i have not lived till now at last i live but i cant live
without her but can she love me i am too old for her why dont
i i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and beginning
to pace up and down the room i always thought it that girl is such
a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat you
dont philosophize dont doubt marry marry marry and i am sure
there will not be a happier man than you
dont talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking into
but do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the arm do you
know the condition i am in i must talk about it to someone
well go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face really
changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince
andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite a
new man where was his spleen his contempt for life his
disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now he
boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not
sacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice and spoke of how he
would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her or
would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that had
mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of
i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of
such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling that
i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into two
halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the other
half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and
darkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand that
i cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am very
happy you understand me i know you are glad for my sake
yes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and
sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince andrews lot appeared to
prince andrew needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to obtain
this he started for the country next day
his father received his sons communication with external composure but
inward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his
life or introduce anything new into it when his own life was already
ending if only they would let me end my days as i want to thought
the old man then they might do as they please with his son however
he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and
adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matter
in the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
birth wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as young
as he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stress
on this while she was very young thirdly he had a son whom it would
be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly and finally the
father said looking ironically at his son i beg you to put it off for
a year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a german
tutor for prince nicholas then if your love or passion or obstinacy as
you please is still as great marry and thats my last word on it
mind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed that
prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings or
his fiancees would not stand a years test or that he the old prince
himself would die before then and he decided to conform to his
fathers wish to propose and postpone the wedding for a year
three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostovs prince
next day after her talk with her mother natasha expected bolkonski all
day but he did not come on the second and third day it was the same
pierre did not come either and natasha not knowing that prince andrew
had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself
three weeks passed in this way natasha had no desire to go out anywhere
and wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and listless she
wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings she
blushed continually and was irritable it seemed to her that everybody
knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her
strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified her
once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began
to cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
the countess began to soothe natasha who after first listening to her
leave off mamma i dont think and dont want to think about it he
just came and then left off left off
her voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and went
and i dont at all want to get married and i am afraid of him i have
the day after this conversation natasha put on the old dress which she
knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
mornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
abandoned since the ball having finished her morning tea she went to
the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance and
began singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exercise
she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
particularly pleased her she listened joyfully as though she had not
expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the whole
empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt
cheerful whats the good of making so much of it things are nice as
it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the room
not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each
step from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair of
shoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe
as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a mirror
she glanced into it there thats me the expression of her face
seemed to say as she caught sight of herself well and very nice too
a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her
walk that morning she had returned to her favorite mood love of and
delight in herself how charming that natasha is she said again
speaking as some third collective male person pretty a good voice
young and in nobodys way if only they leave her in peace but however
much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace and
in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and
then footsteps were heard natasha was looking at the mirror but did
not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw
herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors
pale and agitated natasha ran into the drawing room
mamma bolkonski has come she said mamma it is awful it is
unbearable i dont want to be tormented what am i to do
before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with an
agitated and serious face as soon as he saw natasha his face
brightened he kissed the countess hand and natashas and sat down
it is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but prince
andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously in
i have not been to see you all this time because i have been at my
fathers i had to talk over a very important matter with him i only
got back last night he said glancing at natasha i want to have a
talk with you countess he added after a moments pause
natasha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so
something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared
straight at prince andrew with wide open eyes
at once this instant no it cant be she thought
again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not
mistaken yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided
go natasha i will call you said the countess in a whisper
natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at
i have come countess to ask for your daughters hand said prince
the countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing
your offer she began at last sedately he remained silent looking
into her eyes your offer she grew confused is agreeable to us
and i accept your offer i am glad and my husband i hope but it
i will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it to me
yes replied the countess she held out her hand to him and with a
mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a
son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man i am
sure my husband will consent said the countess but your father
my father to whom i have told my plans has made it an express
condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
year and i wished to tell you of that said prince andrew
it is true that natasha is still young but so long as that
it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh
i will send her to you said the countess and left the room
lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter
sonya said that natasha was in her bedroom natasha was sitting on the
bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering
something as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped
go go to him he is asking for your hand said the countess coldly
it seemed to natasha go go said the mother sadly and
reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away
natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she came
in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger has now
become everything to me she asked herself and immediately answered
yes everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything in the
world prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes
i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope
he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
her face her face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know
why speak when words cannot express what one feels
she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it
yes yes natasha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed loudly
and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob
oh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over
closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she
prince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in
his heart his former love for her something in him had suddenly
changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear
at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though
not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious
did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked prince
is it possible that i the chit of a girl as everybody called me
thought natasha is it possible that i am now to be the wife and the
equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up to
can it be true can it be true that there can be no more playing with
life that now i am grown up that on me now lies a responsibility for
my every word and deed yes but what did he ask me
no she replied but she had not understood his question
forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already been
through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know
natasha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to take
