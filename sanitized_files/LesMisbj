the drivers only reply was to whistle the air of la palisse and to whip
marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air for the
lack of four and twenty sous he was losing his joy his happiness
his love he had seen and he was becoming blind again he reflected
bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five
francs which he had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl
if he had had those five francs he would have been saved he would have
been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he
would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed
state he might have re knotted the black thread of his destiny to that
beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and
had broken at the same instant once more he returned to his hovel in
he might have told himself that m leblanc had promised to return in
the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more
skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his
contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this
as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived on the
other side of the boulevard near the deserted wall skirting the rue de
la barriere des gobelins jondrette wrapped in the philanthropists
great coat engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting
aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowlers of the barriers
people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the
air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which
suggests the supposition that they work by night
these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the
snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman
would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed
still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from
saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jondrette
was talking resembled a certain panchaud alias printanier alias
bigrenaille whom courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very
dangerous nocturnal roamer this mans name the reader has learned in
the preceding book this panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille
figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal
he was at that time only a famous rascal to day he exists in the state
of tradition among ruffians and assassins he was at the head of
a school towards the end of the last reign and in the evening at
nightfall at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers he was
discussed at la force in the fosse aux lions one might even in
that prison precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the
unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in 1843
passes under the culvert read his name panchaud audaciously carved
by his own hand on the wall of the sewer during one of his attempts at
flight in 1832 the police already had their eye on him but he had not
chapter xi offers of service from misery to wretchedness
marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment
when he was about to re enter his cell he caught sight of the elder
jondrette girl following him through the corridor the very sight of
this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was
too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the fiacre
was far away moreover she would not have given them back as for
questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been
there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the
letter signed fabantou had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman
of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas
marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him
it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door
what is it he asked who is there
is it you resumed marius almost harshly still you what do you want
she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him she no longer had
the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning she did
not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius
could see her through the half open door
come now will you answer cried marius what do you want with me
she raised her dull eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker
monsieur marius you look sad what is the matter with you
marius gave the door another push but she retained her hold on it
stop said she you are in the wrong although you are not rich you
were kind this morning be so again now you gave me something to eat
now tell me what ails you you are grieved that is plain i do not want
you to be grieved what can be done for it can i be of any service
employ me i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me
but i may be of use nevertheless i may be able to help you since i
help my father when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses
to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one
i am of service well you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with
you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if
some one speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand
matters and everything comes right make use of me
an idea flashed across marius mind what branch does one disdain when
she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes
oh yes do call me thou i like that better
well he resumed thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his
the jondrettes dull eyes had grown joyous and they now became gloomy
that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you
this them which had turned into her had something indescribably
there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled
never mind after all the address of the father and daughter their
she dropped her head then with a brusque movement she pulled to the
he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed
absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to
vertigo all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of
the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a
gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his
all at once he was violently aroused from his revery
he heard the shrill hard voice of jondrette utter these words which
were fraught with a strange interest for him
i tell you that i am sure of it and that i recognized him
of whom was jondrette speaking whom had he recognized m leblanc the
father of his ursule what did jondrette know him was marius about
to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information
without which his life was so dark to him was he about to learn at last
who it was that he loved who that young girl was who her father
was was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being
dispelled was the veil about to be rent ah heavens
he bounded rather than climbed upon his commode and resumed his post
near the little peep hole in the partition wall
again he beheld the interior of jondrettes hovel
chapter xii the use made of m leblancs five franc piece
nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife
and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and
jackets two new blankets were thrown across the two beds
jondrette had evidently just returned he still had the breathlessness
of out of doors his daughters were seated on the floor near the
fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the youngers wounded hand his
wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative
of astonishment jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long
the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence
sure eight years have passed but i recognize him ah i recognize
him i knew him at once what didnt it force itself on you
but i told you pay attention why it is his figure it is his face
only older there are people who do not grow old i dont know how they
manage it it is the very sound of his voice he is better dressed
that is all ah you mysterious old devil ive got you that i have
get out of here you its queer that it didnt strike you
the air will do it good said jondrette be off
it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to
at the moment when they were about to pass through the door the father
detained the elder by the arm and said to her with a peculiar accent
you will be here at five oclock precisely both of you i shall need
on being left alone with his wife jondrette began to pace the room
again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence then he
spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the womans chemise
all at once he turned to the female jondrette folded his arms and
and would you like to have me tell you something the young lady 
well what retorted his wife the young lady
marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were
speaking he listened with ardent anxiety his whole life was in his
but jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper then he
no expression can reproduce the significance of the mothers words
surprise rage hate wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous
intonation the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which
her husband had whispered in her ear had sufficed to rouse this huge
somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible
it is not possible she cried when i think that my daughters are
going barefoot and have not a gown to their backs what a satin
pelisse a velvet bonnet boots and everything more than two hundred
francs worth of clothes so that one would think she was a lady no
you are mistaken why in the first place the other was hideous and
this one is not so bad looking she really is not bad looking it cant
i tell you that it is she you will see
at this absolute assertion the jondrette woman raised her large red
blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression
at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her
husband she was a sow with the look of a tigress
what she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at
my daughters with an air of pity she is that beggar brat oh i should
like to kick her stomach in for her
she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her
hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists
clenched and drawn back then she fell back on the bed once more the
man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female
after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female
jondrette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done
the woman stared at him with the look that signifies is the person who
is addressing me on the point of going mad
thunder it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of
die of hunger if you have a fire die of cold if you have bread i have
had enough of misery my share and other peoples share i am not joking
any longer i dont find it comic any more ive had enough of puns
good god no more farces eternal father i want to eat till i am full
i want to drink my fill to gormandize to sleep to do nothing i want
to have my turn so i do come now before i die i want to be a bit of
he took a turn round the hovel and added
what do you mean by that asked the woman
he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like
a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration
hush muttered the woman not so loud these are matters which must
bah whos here our neighbor i saw him go out a little while ago
besides he doesnt listen the big booby and i tell you that i saw him
nevertheless by a sort of instinct jondrette lowered his voice
although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words one
favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this
conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles
listen carefully the croesus is caught or as good as caught thats
all settled already everything is arranged i have seen some people he
will come here this evening at six oclock to bring sixty francs the
rascal did you notice how i played that game on him my sixty francs
my landlord my fourth of february i dont even owe for one quarter
isnt he a fool so he will come at six oclock thats the hour when
our neighbor goes to his dinner mother bougon is off washing dishes in
the city theres not a soul in the house the neighbor never comes home
until eleven oclock the children shall stand on watch you shall help
and what if he does not give in demanded his wife
this was the first time marius had seen him laugh the laugh was cold
jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old
cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve
now said he im going out i have some more people that i must see
good ones youll see how well the whole thing will work i shall be
away as short a time as possible its a fine stroke of business do you
and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood
do you know its mighty lucky by the way that he didnt recognize
me if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back
again he would have slipped through our fingers it was my beard that
saved us my romantic beard my pretty little romantic beard
he stepped to the window the snow was still falling and streaking the
this rind is too large for me never mind he added he did a
devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel if it
hadnt been for that i couldnt have gone out and everything would
have gone wrong what small points things hang on anyway
and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room
he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when
the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its
i came near forgetting said he you are to have a brazier of
and he flung into his wifes apron the five franc piece which the
that will come to thirty sous with the rest i will buy something for
dont go and spend the hundred sou piece
because i shall have to buy something too
whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmongers shop
ah yes at the corner of a street i can see the shop
but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase
eating is not the point to day theres something better to be done
at this word from his wife jondrette closed the door again and this
time marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel and
at that moment one oclock struck from the church of saint medard
chapter xiii solus cum solo in loco remoto non cogitabuntur orare
marius dreamer as he was was as we have said firm and energetic by
nature his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in
him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for
irritation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had
the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity
upon a toad but he crushed a viper now it was into a hole of vipers
that his glance had just been directed it was a nest of monsters that
these wretches must be stamped upon said he
not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been
elucidated on the contrary all of them had been rendered more dense
if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the
luxembourg and the man whom he called m leblanc except that jondrette
was acquainted with them athwart the mysterious words which had been
uttered the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the
fact that an ambush was in course of preparation a dark but terrible
trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her
father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the
jondrettes must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken
he scanned the female jondrette for a moment she had pulled an old
sheet iron stove from a corner and she was rummaging among the old heap
he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to
make the least noise amid his terror as to what was in preparation and
in the horror with which the jondrettes had inspired him he experienced
a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to
render a service to the one whom he loved
but how was it to be done how warn the persons threatened he did not
know their address they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes
and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of paris should
he wait for m leblanc at the door that evening at six oclock at the
moment of his arrival and warn him of the trap but jondrette and his
men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger
than he they would devise means to seize him or to get him away and
the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost one oclock had
just struck the trap was to be sprung at six marius had five hours
there was but one thing to be done
he put on his decent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck
took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had
moreover the jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron
once outside of the house he made for the rue du petit banquier
he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall
which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on
a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied
condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he
heard voices talking very close by he turned his head the street was
deserted there was not a soul in it it was broad daylight and yet he
it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting
there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against
these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in a
blouse and the other a long haired individual in rags the bearded man
had on a fez the others head was bare and the snow had lodged in his
by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks
the hairy one jogged the other mans elbow and said
 with the assistance of patron minette it cant fail
do you think so said the bearded man
its as good as a warrant for each one of five hundred balls and the
worst that can happen is five years six years ten years at the most
the other replied with some hesitation and shivering beneath his fez
thats a real thing you cant go against such things
i tell you that the affair cant go wrong resumed the long haired
man father whats his names team will be already harnessed
then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the
it seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men so strangely
hidden behind that wall and crouching in the snow could not but bear
some relation to jondrettes abominable projects that must be the
he directed his course towards the faubourg saint marceau and asked at
the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police
he was directed to rue de pontoise no 14
as he passed a bakers shop he bought a two penny roll and ate it
on the way he rendered justice to providence he reflected that had he
not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning he
would have followed m leblancs fiacre and consequently have remained
ignorant of everything and that there would have been no obstacle to
the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost and
chapter xiv in which a police agent bestows two fistfuls on a lawyer
on arriving at no 14 rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor
the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an
inspector who takes his place would you like to speak to him are you
the clerk introduced him into the commissarys office there stood a
tall man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with
both hands the tails of a vast topcoat with three collars his face
was square with a thin firm mouth thick gray and very ferocious
whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out
of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but
this mans air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than
jondrettes the dog is at times no less terrible to meet than the
what do you want he said to marius without adding monsieur
he is absent i am here in his stead
this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the
same time he inspired fear and confidence marius related the adventure
to him that a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by
sight was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening that as he
occupied the room adjoining the den he marius pontmercy a lawyer
had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who
had planned the trap was a certain jondrette that there would be
accomplices probably some prowlers of the barriers among others a
certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille that jondrettes
daughters were to lie in wait that there was no way of warning the
threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally
all this was to be carried out at six oclock that evening at the most
deserted point of the boulevard de lhopital in house no 50 52
at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said
so it is in the room at the end of the corridor
precisely answered marius and he added are you acquainted with
the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warmed
the heel of his boot at the door of the stove
he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so
patron minette must have had a hand in this
patron minette said he i did hear that word pronounced in fact
and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long haired
man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du
the long haired man must be brujon and the bearded one demi liard
he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought
as for father whats his name i think i recognize him here ive
burned my coat they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves
you saw only that bearded and that long haired man
you didnt see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises
nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des
nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail
as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutants clerks and
employees it is not surprising that you did not see him
no who are all those persons asked marius
besides this is not the time for them
50 52 i know that barrack impossible to conceal ourselves inside
it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply
by countermanding the vaudeville they are so modest an audience
embarrasses them none of that none of that i want to hear them sing
this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at
no more than yourself retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice
that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him
the inspector stared still more intently at marius and continued with
there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man courage does
not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority
that is well but what do you intend to do
the lodgers have pass keys with which to get in at night you must have
marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the
if you will take my advice you will come in force
the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have
bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him
with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the
two immense pockets of his top coat and pulled out two small steel
pistols of the sort called knock me downs then he presented them to
take these go home hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed
to have gone out they are loaded each one carries two balls you will
keep watch there is a hole in the wall as you have informed me these
men will come leave them to their own devices for a time when you
think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a stop
to them fire a shot not too soon the rest concerns me a shot into
the ceiling the air no matter where above all things not too soon
wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are a
lawyer you know the proper point marius took the pistols and put them
that makes a lump that can be seen said the inspector put them in
marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets
now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by
any one what time is it half past two seven oclock is the hour
i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough
dont forget anything that i have said to you bang a pistol shot
and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out
by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and then
come or send here you will ask for inspector javert
a few moments later about three oclock courfeyrac chanced to be
passing along the rue mouffetard in company with bossuet the snow had
redoubled in violence and filled the air bossuet was just saying to
one would say to see all these snow flakes fall that there was a
plague of white butterflies in heaven all at once bossuet caught
sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar
i saw him said courfeyrac dont lets speak to him
he has the air of a man who is following some one
just see the eyes he is making said courfeyrac
some fine flowery bonneted wench hes in love
but observed bossuet i dont see any wench nor any flowery bonnet
in the street theres not a woman round
a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose gray beard could be
distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about
this man was dressed in a great coat which was perfectly new and too
large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags
he retorted courfeyrac hes a poet poets are very fond of wearing
the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of
lets see where marius will go said bossuet lets see where the man
bossuet exclaimed courfeyrac eagle of meaux you are a prodigious
brute follow a man who is following another man indeed
marius had in fact seen jondrette passing along the rue mouffetard
jondrette walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already
he quitted the rue mouffetard and marius saw him enter one of the most
terrible hovels in the rue gracieuse he remained there about a quarter
of an hour then returned to the rue mouffetard he halted at
an ironmongers shop which then stood at the corner of the rue
pierre lombard and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the
shop holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle
which he concealed beneath his great coat at the top of the rue
petit gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du
petit banquier the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a
moment had just begun again marius posted himself on the watch at the
very corner of the rue du petit banquier which was deserted as usual
and did not follow jondrette into it it was lucky that he did so
for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the
long haired man and the bearded man conversing jondrette turned round
made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang
the waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of
an ex livery stable keeper of bad repute who had failed and who still
kept a few old single seated berlins under his sheds
marius thought that it would be wise to profit by jondrettes absence to
return home moreover it was growing late every evening maam bougon
when she set out for her dish washing in town had a habit of locking
the door which was always closed at dusk marius had given his key to
the inspector of police it was important therefore that he should
evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in
the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the
it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of salpetriere
marius returned to no 50 52 with great strides the door was still open
when he arrived he mounted the stairs on tip toe and glided along the
wall of the corridor to his chamber this corridor as the reader will
remember was bordered on both sides by attics all of which were for
the moment empty and to let maam bougon was in the habit of leaving
all the doors open as he passed one of these attics marius thought
he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men
vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer
marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself he
succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making
any noise it was high time a moment later he heard maam bougon take
her departure locking the door of the house behind her
chapter xvi in which will be found the words to an english air which
marius seated himself on his bed it might have been half past five
oclock only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen
he heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch
in the dark he thought of the double march which was going on at that
moment in the dark crime advancing on one side justice coming up on
the other he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder
of what was about to take place as is the case with all those who are
suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced
upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he
was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the
it was no longer snowing the moon disengaged itself more and more
clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection
of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber a sort of
there was a light in the jondrette den marius saw the hole in the wall
shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him
it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle however
there was not a sound in the jondrette quarters not a soul was moving
there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and
profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought
marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed
several minutes elapsed marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges
a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the
latch of the hovel was noisily lifted it was jondrette returning
instantly several voices arose the whole family was in the garret
only it had been silent in the masters absence like wolf whelps in
alls going first rate responded jondrette but my feet are beastly
cold good you have dressed up you have done well you must inspire
dont forget what i told you you will do everything sure
