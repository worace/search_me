cosette persisted and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish
come said the pedler in a rage this wont do at all let my horse
be watered and let that be the end of it
in truth that is fair said madame thenardier if the beast has not
she bent down and discovered cosette cowering at the other end of the
cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself
mademoiselle dog lack name go and water that horse
but madame said cosette feebly there is no water
the thenardier threw the street door wide open
cosette dropped her head and went for an empty bucket which stood near
this bucket was bigger than she was and the child could have set down
the thenardier returned to her stove and tasted what was in the
stewpan with a wooden spoon grumbling the while
theres plenty in the spring there never was such a malicious creature
as that i think i should have done better to strain my onions
then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous pepper and
see here mamselle toad she added on your way back you will get a
big loaf from the baker heres a fifteen sou piece
cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron she took the coin
without saying a word and put it in that pocket
then she stood motionless bucket in hand the open door before her she
seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue
cosette went out the door closed behind her
chapter iv entrance on the scene of a doll
the line of open air booths starting at the church extended as the
reader will remember as far as the hostelry of the thenardiers these
booths were all illuminated because the citizens would soon pass on
their way to the midnight mass with candles burning in paper funnels
which as the schoolmaster then seated at the table at the thenardiers
observed produced a magical effect in compensation not a star was
the last of these stalls established precisely opposite the
thenardiers door was a toy shop all glittering with tinsel glass
and magnificent objects of tin in the first row and far forwards the
merchant had placed on a background of white napkins an immense doll
nearly two feet high who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe with gold
wheat ears on her head which had real hair and enamel eyes all that
day this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers by
under ten years of age without a mother being found in montfermeil
sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child
eponine and azelma had passed hours in contemplating it and cosette
herself had ventured to cast a glance at it on the sly it is true
at the moment when cosette emerged bucket in hand melancholy and
overcome as she was she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to
that wonderful doll towards the lady as she called it the poor child
paused in amazement she had not yet beheld that doll close to the
whole shop seemed a palace to her the doll was not a doll it was a
vision it was joy splendor riches happiness which appeared in
a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly
engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery with the sad and innocent sagacity
of childhood cosette measured the abyss which separated her from
that doll she said to herself that one must be a queen or at least a
princess to have a thing like that she gazed at that beautiful pink
dress that beautiful smooth hair and she thought how happy that doll
must be she could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall the
more she looked the more dazzled she grew she thought she was gazing
at paradise there were other dolls behind the large one which seemed
to her to be fairies and genii the merchant who was pacing back and
forth in front of his shop produced on her somewhat the effect of being
in this adoration she forgot everything even the errand with which she
all at once the thenardiers coarse voice recalled her to reality
what you silly jade you have not gone wait ill give it to you i
want to know what you are doing there get along you little monster
the thenardier had cast a glance into the street and had caught sight
cosette fled dragging her pail and taking the longest strides of which
as the thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is
near the church it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of
chelles that cosette was obliged to go for her water
she did not glance at the display of a single other merchant so long
as she was in boulanger lane and in the neighborhood of the church the
lighted stalls illuminated the road but soon the last light from the
last stall vanished the poor child found herself in the dark she
plunged into it only as a certain emotion overcame her she made as
much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked
along this made a noise which afforded her company
the further she went the denser the darkness became there was no one
in the streets however she did encounter a woman who turned around
on seeing her and stood still muttering between her teeth where can
that child be going is it a werewolf child then the woman recognized
in this manner cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted
streets which terminate in the village of montfermeil on the side of
chelles so long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both
sides of her path she proceeded with tolerable boldness from time
to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a
shutter this was light and life there were people there and it
reassured her but in proportion as she advanced her pace slackened
mechanically as it were when she had passed the corner of the last
house cosette paused it had been hard to advance further than the last
stall it became impossible to proceed further than the last house she
set her bucket on the ground thrust her hand into her hair and
began slowly to scratch her head a gesture peculiar to children when
terrified and undecided what to do it was no longer montfermeil it
was the open fields black and desert space was before her she gazed in
despair at that darkness where there was no longer any one where there
were beasts where there were spectres possibly she took a good
look and heard the beasts walking on the grass and she distinctly saw
spectres moving in the trees then she seized her bucket again fear had
lent her audacity bah said she i will tell him that there was no
more water and she resolutely re entered montfermeil
hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch
her head again now it was the thenardier who appeared to her with her
hideous hyena mouth and wrath flashing in her eyes the child cast a
melancholy glance before her and behind her what was she to do what
was to become of her where was she to go in front of her was the
spectre of the thenardier behind her all the phantoms of the night
and of the forest it was before the thenardier that she recoiled she
resumed her path to the spring and began to run she emerged from
the village she entered the forest at a run no longer looking at or
listening to anything she only paused in her course when her breath
failed her but she did not halt in her advance she went straight
the nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely
she no longer thought she no longer saw the immensity of night was
facing this tiny creature on the one hand all shadow on the other an
it was only seven or eight minutes walk from the edge of the woods to
the spring cosette knew the way through having gone over it many times
in daylight strange to say she did not get lost a remnant of instinct
guided her vaguely but she did not turn her eyes either to right or to
left for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood in
it was a narrow natural basin hollowed out by the water in a clayey
soil about two feet deep surrounded with moss and with those tall
crimped grasses which are called henry ivs frills and paved with
several large stones a brook ran out of it with a tranquil little
cosette did not take time to breathe it was very dark but she was in
the habit of coming to this spring she felt with her left hand in the
dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring and which usually
served to support her found one of its branches clung to it bent
down and plunged the bucket in the water she was in a state of such
violent excitement that her strength was trebled while thus bent over
she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into
the spring the fifteen sou piece fell into the water cosette neither
saw nor heard it fall she drew out the bucket nearly full and set it
that done she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue she would
have liked to set out again at once but the effort required to fill the
bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step she
was forced to sit down she dropped on the grass and remained crouching
she shut her eyes then she opened them again without knowing why but
because she could not do otherwise the agitated water in the bucket
beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents
overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds which were like
masses of smoke the tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over
the child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star with which she
was unfamiliar and which terrified her the planet was in fact very
near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted
to it a horrible ruddy hue the mist gloomily empurpled magnified the
star one would have called it a luminous wound
a cold wind was blowing from the plain the forest was dark not a leaf
was moving there were none of the vague fresh gleams of summertide
great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise slender and
misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings the tall grasses undulated
like eels under the north wind the nettles seemed to twist long arms
furnished with claws in search of prey some bits of dry heather tossed
by the breeze flew rapidly by and had the air of fleeing in terror
before something which was coming after on all sides there were
the darkness was bewildering man requires light whoever buries himself
in the opposite of day feels his heart contract when the eye sees
black the heart sees trouble in an eclipse in the night in the sooty
opacity there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts no one walks
alone in the forest at night without trembling shadows and trees two
formidable densities a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct
depths the inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with
a spectral clearness one beholds floating either in space or in ones
own brain one knows not what vague and intangible thing like the
dreams of sleeping flowers there are fierce attitudes on the horizon
one inhales the effluvia of the great black void one is afraid to
glance behind him yet desirous of doing so the cavities of night
things grown haggard taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances
obscure dishevelments irritated tufts livid pools the lugubrious
reflected in the funereal the sepulchral immensity of silence unknown
but possible beings bendings of mysterious branches alarming torsos of
trees long handfuls of quivering plants against all this one has no
protection there is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does
not feel the vicinity of anguish one is conscious of something hideous
as though ones soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness this
penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a
forests are apocalypses and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul
produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault
without understanding her sensations cosette was conscious that she was
seized upon by that black enormity of nature it was no longer terror
alone which was gaining possession of her it was something more
terrible even than terror she shivered there are no words to express
the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of
her heart her eye grew wild she thought she felt that she should not
be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow
then by a sort of instinct she began to count aloud one two three
four and so on up to ten in order to escape from that singular state
which she did not understand but which terrified her and when she had
finished she began again this restored her to a true perception of
the things about her her hands which she had wet in drawing the water
felt cold she rose her terror a natural and unconquerable terror had
returned she had but one thought now to flee at full speed through
the forest across the fields to the houses to the windows to the
lighted candles her glance fell upon the water which stood before her
such was the fright which the thenardier inspired in her that she dared
not flee without that bucket of water she seized the handle with both
in this manner she advanced a dozen paces but the bucket was full it
was heavy she was forced to set it on the ground once more she took
breath for an instant then lifted the handle of the bucket again and
resumed her march proceeding a little further this time but again she
was obliged to pause after some seconds of repose she set out again
she walked bent forward with drooping head like an old woman the
weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms the iron
handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands
she was forced to halt from time to time and each time that she did so
the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs this
took place in the depths of a forest at night in winter far from all
human sight she was a child of eight no one but god saw that sad thing
for there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves
she panted with a sort of painful rattle sobs contracted her throat
but she dared not weep so afraid was she of the thenardier even at a
distance it was her custom to imagine the thenardier always present
however she could not make much headway in that manner and she went
on very slowly in spite of diminishing the length of her stops and
of walking as long as possible between them she reflected with anguish
that it would take her more than an hour to return to montfermeil in
this manner and that the thenardier would beat her this anguish was
mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night she was
worn out with fatigue and had not yet emerged from the forest on
arriving near an old chestnut tree with which she was acquainted made
a last halt longer than the rest in order that she might get well
rested then she summoned up all her strength picked up her bucket
again and courageously resumed her march but the poor little desperate
creature could not refrain from crying o my god my god
at that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer
weighed anything at all a hand which seemed to her enormous had just
seized the handle and lifted it vigorously she raised her head a
large black form straight and erect was walking beside her through the
darkness it was a man who had come up behind her and whose approach
she had not heard this man without uttering a word had seized the
handle of the bucket which she was carrying
there are instincts for all the encounters of life
on the afternoon of that same christmas day 1823 a man had walked
for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de
lhopital in paris this man had the air of a person who is seeking
lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest
houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg saint marceau
we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in
this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what
may be called the well bred mendicant extreme wretchedness combined
with extreme cleanliness this is a very rare mixture which inspires
intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man
who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy he wore a very
old and very well brushed round hat a coarse coat worn perfectly
threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least
eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable
cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted
and thick shoes with copper buckles he would have been pronounced a
preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration he would
have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly
white hair his wrinkled brow his livid lips and his countenance
where everything breathed depression and weariness of life judging from
his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements
he would have hardly been thought fifty the wrinkles on his brow were
well placed and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed
him attentively his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed
severe and which was humble there was in the depth of his glance an
indescribable melancholy serenity in his left hand he carried a little
bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a
cudgel cut from some hedge this stick had been carefully trimmed and
had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its
knots and it had received a coral like head made from red wax it was
a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane
there are but few passers by on that boulevard particularly in the
winter the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this
at that epoch king louis xviii went nearly every day to choisy le roi
it was one of his favorite excursions towards two oclock almost
invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full
this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter
who said it is two oclock there he is returning to the tuileries
and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king
always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of
louis xviii produced a certain effect in the streets of paris it was
rapid but majestic this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop
as he was not able to walk he wished to run that cripple would gladly
have had himself drawn by the lightning he passed pacific and severe
in the midst of naked swords his massive coach all covered with
gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered
noisily along there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it in the
rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white
satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered a loiseau
royal a proud hard crafty eye the smile of an educated man two
great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the
golden fleece the cross of saint louis the cross of the legion of
honor the silver plaque of the saint esprit a huge belly and a wide
blue ribbon it was the king outside of paris he held his hat decked
with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english
gaiters when he re entered the city he put on his hat and saluted
rarely he stared coldly at the people and they returned it in kind
when he appeared for the first time in the saint marceau quarter
the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an
inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is
this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the
the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the
quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to
this detail when at two oclock the royal carriage surrounded by a
squadron of the body guard all covered with silver lace debouched
on the boulevard after having made the turn of the salpetriere he
appeared surprised and almost alarmed there was no one but himself in
this cross lane he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an
enclosure though this did not prevent m le duc de havre from spying
m le duc de havre as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated
in the carriage opposite the king he said to his majesty yonder
is an evil looking man members of the police who were clearing the
kings route took equal note of him one of them received an order to
follow him but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the
faubourg and as twilight was beginning to fall the agent lost trace of
him as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m le comte
when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track
he redoubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure
himself that he was not being followed at a quarter past four that is
to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre
of the porte saint martin where the two convicts was being played that
day this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for
although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it an instant later
he was in the blind alley of la planchette and he entered the plat
detain the pewter platter where the office of the coach for lagny
was then situated this coach set out at half past four the horses were
harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily
climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle
only one beside me on the box said the coachman
nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the
travellers shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made
are you going as far as lagny demanded the coachman
they started when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried
to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in
monosyllables the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his
the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak it was cold the man
did not appear to be thinking of that thus they passed gournay and
towards six oclock in the evening they reached chelles the coachman
drew up in front of the carters inn installed in the ancient buildings
of the royal abbey to give his horses a breathing spell
he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle
when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later it did not
encounter him in the principal street of chelles
there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know
him he had not the air of owning a sou but he does not consider money
he pays to lagny and he goes only as far as chelles it is night all
the houses are shut he does not enter the inn and he is not to be
found so he has dived through the earth
the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great
strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he
had turned to the right before reaching the church into the cross road
leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the
he followed this road rapidly at the spot where it is intersected by
the ancient tree bordered road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard
people coming he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there
waited until the passers by were at a distance the precaution was
nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very
dark december night not more than two or three stars were visible in
it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins the man did not
return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the
right and entered the forest with long strides
once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful
examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking
and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a
moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision at
last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing
where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to
these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night
as though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with
those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces
distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed
his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and
opposite this tree which was an ash there was a chestnut tree
suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been
nailed by way of dressing he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this
then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space
between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to
assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed
that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the
it was the man who had just met cosette
as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had
espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on
the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and
perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket
of water then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle
chapter vii cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark
cosette as we have said was not frightened
the man accosted her he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost
my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you
give it to me said the man i will carry it for you
cosette let go of the bucket handle the man walked along beside her
it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth then he
and have you come from far like this
a good quarter of an hours walk from here
the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly
before the man had time to speak again she added
i dont think so other people have mothers i have none
the man halted he set the bucket on the ground bent down and placed
both hands on the childs shoulders making an effort to look at her and
cosettes thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light
the man seemed to have received an electric shock he looked at her once
more then he removed his hands from cosettes shoulders seized the
at montfermeil if you know where that is
who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest
the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render indifferent but
in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor
she is my mistress said the child she keeps the inn
the inn said the man well i am going to lodge there to night show
we are on the way there said the child
the man walked tolerably fast cosette followed him without difficulty
she no longer felt any fatigue from time to time she raised her eyes
towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable
confidence she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray
nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and
is there no servant in madame thenardiers house
another pause ensued cosette lifted up her voice
that is to say there are two little girls
this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the
they are madame thenardiers young ladies her daughters as you would
oh said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in
them all full of affairs they play they amuse themselves
the child raised her great eyes in which hung a tear which was not
visible because of the darkness and replied gently
after an interval of silence she went on
sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse
in the best way i can they let me alone but i have not many
playthings ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls i
have only a little lead sword no longer than that
yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies
they reached the village cosette guided the stranger through the
streets they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the
bread which she had been ordered to fetch the man had ceased to ply her
with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence
when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all
so there is a fair going on here
as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm
will you let me take my bucket now
if madame sees that some one has carried it for me she will beat me
the man handed her the bucket an instant later they were at the tavern
chapter viii the unpleasantness of receiving into ones house a poor
cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big
doll which was still displayed at the toy merchants then she knocked
the door opened the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand
ah so its you you little wretch good mercy but youve taken your
madame said cosette trembling all over heres a gentleman who
the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace
a change of aspect common to tavern keepers and eagerly sought the
yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat
wealthy travellers are not so polite this gesture and an inspection
of the strangers costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in
review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the
the good man entered the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid
particular attention to his frock coat which was absolutely threadbare
and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head
wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband
who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that
imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an
inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar
ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left
put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i
will pay as though i occupied a room
forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman
it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i
thats true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such
in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench
had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a
bottle of wine and a glass the merchant who had demanded the bucket of
water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the
the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had
poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention
cosette was ugly if she had been happy she might have been pretty we
have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was
thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be
hardly six her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put
out with weeping the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual
anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people
her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains the
fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the
angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her
knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which
would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter
all she had on was hole ridden linen not a scrap of woollen her skin
was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be
descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched
her her naked legs were thin and red the hollows in her neck were
enough to make one weep this childs whole person her mien her
attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to
elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her
slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole idea fear
fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak
fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her
petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only
the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be
called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except
an increase in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook
her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not
dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her
the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually
so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as
though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon
as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never
set foot in a church have i the time said the thenardier
the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette
cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her
voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table
she had completely forgotten the bread she had recourse to the
expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied
ill find out to morrow whether that is true said the thenardier
and if you are telling me a lie ill lead you a pretty dance in the
meantime give me back my fifteen sou piece
cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green
ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me
cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what
could have become of that money the unhappy little creature could not
find a word to say she was petrified
have you lost that fifteen sou piece screamed the thenardier
hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it
at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the
cat o nine tails which hung on a nail in the chimney corner
this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to
mercy madame madame i will not do so any more
in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob
of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides
the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying
cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle
of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude
pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of
something which had fallen from this little ones apron pocket and
at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor
exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up
and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier
it was not it for it was a twenty sou piece but the thenardier found
it to her advantage she put the coin in her pocket and confined
herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the
cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her
large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an
expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an
innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with
by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the
he made no reply he appeared to be absorbed in thought
what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth hes some
frightfully poor wretch he hasnt a sou to pay for a supper will he
even pay me for his lodging its very lucky all the same that it did
not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor
in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered
they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant
in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses
the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious
neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye they were
warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the
stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement there was a
hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced light
emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the
throne in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they
made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to
