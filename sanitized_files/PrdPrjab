carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first
came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited
for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was
well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well
jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud
if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives
for a whole days tete a tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel come as soon as you can on receipt of this my brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever
with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to
rain and then you must stay all night
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton
and the hursts have no horses to theirs
i had much rather go in the coach
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are
wanted in the farm mr bennet are they not
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mothers purpose
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was
delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than
once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the
next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not
hear of my returning till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr
jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me and excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note
aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she
should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
oh i am not afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling
colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is
all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though
the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking
was her only alternative she declared her resolution
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a
thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing
when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing
field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last
within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face
she was shown into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were
assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and
miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it she was received however very politely by them and in their
brothers manners there was something better than politeness there
was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr
hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as
to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter was
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss
bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not
well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal
however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them
together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth
began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having
examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught
a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice
was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head
ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very
unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern
in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to
longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then
poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very
favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing
this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how
shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his
attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was
engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to
eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence
she had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought the
she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent
walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very
nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the
country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep
in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was
all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is
above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by
it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence
it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a
short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again
i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very
sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with
such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it
would not make them one jot less agreeable
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on
leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till
late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself on entering the drawing room she found the whole
party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the
excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am
not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and
i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left
so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get
elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very
little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew
near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished
for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and
net purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure
i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has
too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my
nor i i am sure said miss bingley
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing
dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides
all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women
i rather wonder now at your knowing any
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all
conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the
elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her
is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it
succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed
there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and
that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent for
immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could
be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet
were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters
declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness
however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her
own judgement of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and
its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her
two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been
very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she
would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried
home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think
it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss
bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected
indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be
moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass
removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility
that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers
a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is
always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest
temper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they are
nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in the
country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it
in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five
minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen
that is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a
studier of character it must be an amusing study
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at
the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that
going on in the country as in town
everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment
turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their
advantages and i can be equally happy in either
aye that is because you have the right disposition but that
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing
indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her
mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards
mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away
yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir
william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so
genteel and easy he has always something to say to everybody that
is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for
my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work
my daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is to
judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls
i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think
charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend
oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself
has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast
of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see anybody
better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own
partiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother
gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he
did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has
been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy
of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is
strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to
speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to
jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be
civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion
and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high
animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the
attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when
your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill
lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes it would be much better to
wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she
added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who
continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing room the loo table however did not appear
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness
of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year letters of business too how odious i should think them
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours
pray tell your sister that i long to see her
i have already told her so once by your desire
i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend
thank you but i always mend my own
how can you contrive to write so even
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at
present i have not room to do them justice
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you
always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her
brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for
words of four syllables do not you darcy
my style of writing is very different from yours
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of
humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in
writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you
think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour
i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this
moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were
mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better
stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not
go and at another word might stay a month
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for
you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine
but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to
stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and
the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not
forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with
myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in
particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her
i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument
perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very
thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed
on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine
however at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in
any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked
him too little to care for his approbation
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by
a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an
she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really
believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of
their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this
desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue
and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after
officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to
check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence
have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the
judge they are in the same profession you know only in different
lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their
colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some
you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk
by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness
this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them
no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear
to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her
sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the
drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed
himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also
made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and
attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from
the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone
else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the
card table but in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr
darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same
and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she
could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her
question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult
the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he
chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled
thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were
carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but
darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in
the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and
miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a
turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked
up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was
directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his
meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe
on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in
anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon
as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be
completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better
oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard anything so
abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we
can all plague and punish one another tease him laugh at him intimate
as you are you must know how it is to be done
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me that tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will
