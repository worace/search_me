transcribed from the 1892 george bell and sons edition by david price
the author of these travels mr lemuel gulliver is my ancient and
intimate friend there is likewise some relation between us on the
mothers side about three years ago mr gulliver growing weary of the
concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in redriff made a
small purchase of land with a convenient house near newark in
nottinghamshire his native country where he now lives retired yet in
although mr gulliver was born in nottinghamshire where his father
dwelt yet i have heard him say his family came from oxfordshire to
confirm which i have observed in the churchyard at banbury in that
county several tombs and monuments of the gullivers
before he quitted redriff he left the custody of the following papers in
my hands with the liberty to dispose of them as i should think fit i
have carefully perused them three times the style is very plain and
simple and the only fault i find is that the author after the manner
of travellers is a little too circumstantial there is an air of truth
apparent through the whole and indeed the author was so distinguished
for his veracity that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours
at redriff when any one affirmed a thing to say it was as true as if
by the advice of several worthy persons to whom with the authors
permission i communicated these papers i now venture to send them into
the world hoping they may be at least for some time a better
entertainment to our young noblemen than the common scribbles of
this volume would have been at least twice as large if i had not made
bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides
as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages
together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in
storms in the style of sailors likewise the account of longitudes and
latitudes wherein i have reason to apprehend that mr gulliver may be a
little dissatisfied but i was resolved to fit the work as much as
possible to the general capacity of readers however if my own
ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes i
alone am answerable for them and if any traveller hath a curiosity to
see the whole work at large as it came from the hands of the author i
as for any further particulars relating to the author the reader will
receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book
a letter from captain gulliver to his cousin sympson
i hope you will be ready to own publicly whenever you shall be called to
it that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to
publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels with directions
to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order
and correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advice in his
book called a voyage round the world but i do not remember i gave you
power to consent that any thing should be omitted and much less that any
thing should be inserted therefore as to the latter i do here renounce
every thing of that kind particularly a paragraph about her majesty
queen anne of most pious and glorious memory although i did reverence
and esteem her more than any of human species but you or your
interpolator ought to have considered that it was not my inclination
so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my
master houyhnhnm and besides the fact was altogether false for to my
knowledge being in england during some part of her majestys reign she
did govern by a chief minister nay even by two successively the first
whereof was the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford so
that you have made me say the thing that was not likewise in the
account of the academy of projectors and several passages of my
discourse to my master houyhnhnm you have either omitted some material
circumstances or minced or changed them in such a manner that i do
hardly know my own work when i formerly hinted to you something of this
in a letter you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving
offence that people in power were very watchful over the press and apt
not only to interpret but to punish every thing which looked like an
innuendo as i think you call it but pray how could that which i
spoke so many years ago and at about five thousand leagues distance in
another reign be applied to any of the yahoos who now are said to
govern the herd especially at a time when i little thought or feared
the unhappiness of living under them have not i the most reason to
complain when i see these very yahoos carried by houyhnhnms in a
vehicle as if they were brutes and those the rational creatures and
indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal
thus much i thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself and to
i do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgment in
being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and
some others very much against my own opinion to suffer my travels to be
published pray bring to your mind how often i desired you to consider
when you insisted on the motive of public good that the yahoos were a
species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example
and so it has proved for instead of seeing a full stop put to all
abuses and corruptions at least in this little island as i had reason
to expect behold after above six months warning i cannot learn that my
book has produced one single effect according to my intentions i
desired you would let me know by a letter when party and faction were
extinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modest
with some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramids
of law books the young nobilitys education entirely changed the
physicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honour
truth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly
weeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers of
the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own
cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a
thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement
as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my
book and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to
correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their
natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom
yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your
letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with
libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein
i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degrading
human nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and of
abusing the female sex i find likewise that the writers of those
bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow
me to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of books
i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the
times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither
assigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i
hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my
book neither have i any copy left however i have sent you some
corrections which you may insert if ever there should be a second
edition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter to
my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please
i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea language as not
proper in many parts nor now in use i cannot help it in my first
voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and
learned to speak as they did but i have since found that the sea
yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new fangled in their
words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon
each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i
could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes
from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us
are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the
if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my
book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so
far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more
indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag
for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously
brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so
presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related
concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with
conviction and is there less probability in my account of the
houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are
so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their
brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and
do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation
the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me
than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my
stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in
do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as
to defend my veracity yahoo as i am it is well known through all
houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious
master i was able in the compass of two years although i confess with
the utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling
deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my
i have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but i
forbear troubling myself or you any further i must freely confess that
since my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revived
in me by conversing with a few of your species and particularly those of
my own family by an unavoidable necessity else i should never have
attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the yahoo race in
this kingdom but i have now done with all such visionary schemes for

inducements to travel he is shipwrecked and swims for his life gets
safe on shore in the country of lilliput is made a prisoner and carried
my father had a small estate in nottinghamshire i was the third of five
sons he sent me to emanuel college in cambridge at fourteen years old
where i resided three years and applied myself close to my studies but
the charge of maintaining me although i had a very scanty allowance
being too great for a narrow fortune i was bound apprentice to mr james
bates an eminent surgeon in london with whom i continued four years
my father now and then sending me small sums of money i laid them out in
learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics useful to those
who intend to travel as i always believed it would be some time or
other my fortune to do when i left mr bates i went down to my
father where by the assistance of him and my uncle john and some other
relations i got forty pounds and a promise of thirty pounds a year to
maintain me at leyden there i studied physic two years and seven months
knowing it would be useful in long voyages
soon after my return from leyden i was recommended by my good master
mr bates to be surgeon to the swallow captain abraham pannel
commander with whom i continued three years and a half making a voyage
or two into the levant and some other parts when i came back i
resolved to settle in london to which mr bates my master encouraged
me and by him i was recommended to several patients i took part of a
small house in the old jewry and being advised to alter my condition i
married mrs mary burton second daughter to mr edmund burton hosier
in newgate street with whom i received four hundred pounds for a
but my good master bates dying in two years after and i having few
friends my business began to fail for my conscience would not suffer me
to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren having
therefore consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintance i
determined to go again to sea i was surgeon successively in two ships
and made several voyages for six years to the east and west indies by
which i got some addition to my fortune my hours of leisure i spent in
reading the best authors ancient and modern being always provided with
a good number of books and when i was ashore in observing the manners
and dispositions of the people as well as learning their language
wherein i had a great facility by the strength of my memory
the last of these voyages not proving very fortunate i grew weary of the
sea and intended to stay at home with my wife and family i removed
from the old jewry to fetter lane and from thence to wapping hoping to
get business among the sailors but it would not turn to account after
three years expectation that things would mend i accepted an
advantageous offer from captain william prichard master of the antelope
who was making a voyage to the south sea we set sail from bristol may
4 1699 and our voyage was at first very prosperous
it would not be proper for some reasons to trouble the reader with the
particulars of our adventures in those seas let it suffice to inform
him that in our passage from thence to the east indies we were driven
by a violent storm to the north west of van diemens land by an
observation we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes
south twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food
the rest were in a very weak condition on the 5th of november which
was the beginning of summer in those parts the weather being very hazy
the seamen spied a rock within half a cables length of the ship but the
wind was so strong that we were driven directly upon it and immediately
split six of the crew of whom i was one having let down the boat into
the sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock we rowed
by my computation about three leagues till we were able to work no
longer being already spent with labour while we were in the ship we
therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about half
an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north what
became of my companions in the boat as well as of those who escaped on
the rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but conclude they
were all lost for my own part i swam as fortune directed me and was
pushed forward by wind and tide i often let my legs drop and could
feel no bottom but when i was almost gone and able to struggle no
longer i found myself within my depth and by this time the storm was
much abated the declivity was so small that i walked near a mile
before i got to the shore which i conjectured was about eight oclock in
the evening i then advanced forward near half a mile but could not
discover any sign of houses or inhabitants at least i was in so weak a
condition that i did not observe them i was extremely tired and with
that and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandy that i
drank as i left the ship i found myself much inclined to sleep i lay
down on the grass which was very short and soft where i slept sounder
than ever i remembered to have done in my life and as i reckoned about
nine hours for when i awaked it was just day light i attempted to
rise but was not able to stir for as i happened to lie on my back i
found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground
and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner i
likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body from my arm pits
to my thighs i could only look upwards the sun began to grow hot and
the light offended my eyes i heard a confused noise about me but in
the posture i lay could see nothing except the sky in a little time i
felt something alive moving on my left leg which advancing gently
forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyes
downwards as much as i could i perceived it to be a human creature not
six inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands and a quiver at his
back in the mean time i felt at least forty more of the same kind as
i conjectured following the first i was in the utmost astonishment
and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them
as i was afterwards told were hurt with the falls they got by leaping
from my sides upon the ground however they soon returned and one of
them who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifting up
his hands and eyes by way of admiration cried out in a shrill but
distinct voice hekinah degul the others repeated the same words
several times but then i knew not what they meant i lay all this
while as the reader may believe in great uneasiness at length
struggling to get loose i had the fortune to break the strings and
wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground for by
lifting it up to my face i discovered the methods they had taken to bind
me and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excessive
pain i a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left
side so that i was just able to turn my head about two inches but the
creatures ran off a second time before i could seize them whereupon
there was a great shout in a very shrill accent and after it ceased i
heard one of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i felt
above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me like
so many needles and besides they shot another flight into the air as
we do bombs in europe whereof many i suppose fell on my body though
i felt them not and some on my face which i immediately covered with
my left hand when this shower of arrows was over i fell a groaning
with grief and pain and then striving again to get loose they
discharged another volley larger than the first and some of them
attempted with spears to stick me in the sides but by good luck i had on
a buff jerkin which they could not pierce i thought it the most
prudent method to lie still and my design was to continue so till night
when my left hand being already loose i could easily free myself and
as for the inhabitants i had reason to believe i might be a match for
the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the
same size with him that i saw but fortune disposed otherwise of me
when the people observed i was quiet they discharged no more arrows
but by the noise i heard i knew their numbers increased and about four
yards from me over against my right ear i heard a knocking for above an
hour like that of people at work when turning my head that way as well
as the pegs and strings would permit me i saw a stage erected about a
foot and a half from the ground capable of holding four of the
inhabitants with two or three ladders to mount it from whence one of
them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech
whereof i understood not one syllable but i should have mentioned that
before the principal person began his oration he cried out three times
langro dehul san these words and the former were afterwards repeated
and explained to me whereupon immediately about fifty of the
inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my
head which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right and of
observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak he appeared
to be of a middle age and taller than any of the other three who
attended him whereof one was a page that held up his train and seemed
to be somewhat longer than my middle finger the other two stood one on
each side to support him he acted every part of an orator and i could
observe many periods of threatenings and others of promises pity and
kindness i answered in a few words but in the most submissive manner
lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun as calling him for
a witness and being almost famished with hunger having not eaten a
morsel for some hours before i left the ship i found the demands of
nature so strong upon me that i could not forbear showing my impatience
perhaps against the strict rules of decency by putting my finger
frequently to my mouth to signify that i wanted food the hurgo for
so they call a great lord as i afterwards learnt understood me very
well he descended from the stage and commanded that several ladders
should be applied to my sides on which above a hundred of the
inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth laden with baskets full
of meat which had been provided and sent thither by the kings orders
upon the first intelligence he received of me i observed there was the
flesh of several animals but could not distinguish them by the taste
there were shoulders legs and loins shaped like those of mutton and
very well dressed but smaller than the wings of a lark i ate them by
two or three at a mouthful and took three loaves at a time about the
bigness of musket bullets they supplied me as fast as they could
showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and
appetite i then made another sign that i wanted drink they found by
my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me and being a most
ingenious people they slung up with great dexterity one of their
largest hogsheads then rolled it towards my hand and beat out the top
i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold
half a pint and tasted like a small wine of burgundy but much more
delicious they brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the same
manner and made signs for more but they had none to give me when i
had performed these wonders they shouted for joy and danced upon my
breast repeating several times as they did at first hekinah degul
they made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogsheads but first
warning the people below to stand out of the way crying aloud borach
mevolah and when they saw the vessels in the air there was a universal
shout of hekinah degul i confess i was often tempted while they were
passing backwards and forwards on my body to seize forty or fifty of the
first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground but the
remembrance of what i had felt which probably might not be the worst
they could do and the promise of honour i made them for so i interpreted
my submissive behaviour soon drove out these imaginations besides i
now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality to a people
who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence however in my
thoughts i could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these
diminutive mortals who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body
while one of my hands was at liberty without trembling at the very sight
of so prodigious a creature as i must appear to them after some time
when they observed that i made no more demands for meat there appeared
before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty his
excellency having mounted on the small of my right leg advanced
forwards up to my face with about a dozen of his retinue and producing
his credentials under the signet royal which he applied close to my
eyes spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger but with a kind
of determinate resolution often pointing forwards which as i
afterwards found was towards the capital city about half a mile
distant whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that i must be
conveyed i answered in few words but to no purpose and made a sign
with my hand that was loose putting it to the other but over his
excellencys head for fear of hurting him or his train and then to my
own head and body to signify that i desired my liberty it appeared
that he understood me well enough for he shook his head by way of
disapprobation and held his hand in a posture to show that i must be
carried as a prisoner however he made other signs to let me understand
that i should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment
whereupon i once more thought of attempting to break my bonds but again
when i felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands which were
all in blisters and many of the darts still sticking in them and
observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased i gave tokens
to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased upon
this the hurgo and his train withdrew with much civility and cheerful
countenances soon after i heard a general shout with frequent
repetitions of the words peplom selan and i felt great numbers of
people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree that i was
able to turn upon my right and to ease myself with making water which i
very plentifully did to the great astonishment of the people who
conjecturing by my motion what i was going to do immediately opened to
the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with
such noise and violence from me but before this they had daubed my
face and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the
smell which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows
these circumstances added to the refreshment i had received by their
victuals and drink which were very nourishing disposed me to sleep i
slept about eight hours as i was afterwards assured and it was no
wonder for the physicians by the emperors order had mingled a sleepy
it seems that upon the first moment i was discovered sleeping on the
ground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it by an
express and determined in council that i should be tied in the manner i
have related which was done in the night while i slept that plenty of
meat and drink should be sent to me and a machine prepared to carry me
this resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous and i am
confident would not be imitated by any prince in europe on the like
occasion however in my opinion it was extremely prudent as well as
generous for supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with
their spears and arrows while i was asleep i should certainly have
awaked with the first sense of smart which might so far have roused my
rage and strength as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith i
was tied after which as they were not able to make resistance so they
these people are most excellent mathematicians and arrived to a great
perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the
emperor who is a renowned patron of learning this prince has several
machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great
weights he often builds his largest men of war whereof some are nine
feet long in the woods where the timber grows and has them carried on
these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea five hundred
carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the
greatest engine they had it was a frame of wood raised three inches
from the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upon
twenty two wheels the shout i heard was upon the arrival of this
engine which it seems set out in four hours after my landing it was
brought parallel to me as i lay but the principal difficulty was to
raise and place me in this vehicle eighty poles each of one foot high
were erected for this purpose and very strong cords of the bigness of
packthread were fastened by hooks to many bandages which the workmen
had girt round my neck my hands my body and my legs nine hundred of
the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys
fastened on the poles and thus in less than three hours i was raised
and slung into the engine and there tied fast all this i was told
for while the operation was performing i lay in a profound sleep by
the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor fifteen
hundred of the emperors largest horses each about four inches and a
half high were employed to draw me towards the metropolis which as i
about four hours after we began our journey i awaked by a very
ridiculous accident for the carriage being stopped a while to adjust
something that was out of order two or three of the young natives had
the curiosity to see how i looked when i was asleep they climbed up into
the engine and advancing very softly to my face one of them an officer
in the guards put the sharp end of his half pike a good way up into my
left nostril which tickled my nose like a straw and made me sneeze
violently whereupon they stole off unperceived and it was three weeks
before i knew the cause of my waking so suddenly we made a long march
the remaining part of the day and rested at night with five hundred
guards on each side of me half with torches and half with bows and
arrows ready to shoot me if i should offer to stir the next morning at
sun rise we continued our march and arrived within two hundred yards of
the city gates about noon the emperor and all his court came out to
meet us but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to
endanger his person by mounting on my body
at the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple
esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom which having been
polluted some years before by an unnatural murder was according to the
zeal of those people looked upon as profane and therefore had been
applied to common use and all the ornaments and furniture carried away
in this edifice it was determined i should lodge the great gate
fronting to the north was about four feet high and almost two feet wide
through which i could easily creep on each side of the gate was a small
window not above six inches from the ground into that on the left side
the kings smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains like those that
hang to a ladys watch in europe and almost as large which were locked
to my left leg with six and thirty padlocks over against this temple
on the other side of the great highway at twenty feet distance there
was a turret at least five feet high here the emperor ascended with
many principal lords of his court to have an opportunity of viewing me
as i was told for i could not see them it was reckoned that above a
hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand
and in spite of my guards i believe there could not be fewer than ten
thousand at several times who mounted my body by the help of ladders
but a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of death
when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut
all the strings that bound me whereupon i rose up with as melancholy a
disposition as ever i had in my life but the noise and astonishment of
the people at seeing me rise and walk are not to be expressed the
chains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me not
only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle but
being fixed within four inches of the gate allowed me to creep in and
lie at my full length in the temple
the emperor of lilliput attended by several of the nobility comes to
see the author in his confinement the emperors person and habit
described learned men appointed to teach the author their language he
gains favour by his mild disposition his pockets are searched and his
when i found myself on my feet i looked about me and must confess i
never beheld a more entertaining prospect the country around appeared
like a continued garden and the enclosed fields which were generally
forty feet square resembled so many beds of flowers these fields were
intermingled with woods of half a stang 301 and the tallest trees as
i could judge appeared to be seven feet high i viewed the town on my
left hand which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre
i had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature
which was no wonder it being almost two days since i had last
disburdened myself i was under great difficulties between urgency and
shame the best expedient i could think of was to creep into my house
which i accordingly did and shutting the gate after me i went as far as
the length of my chain would suffer and discharged my body of that
uneasy load but this was the only time i was ever guilty of so
uncleanly an action for which i cannot but hope the candid reader will
give some allowance after he has maturely and impartially considered my
case and the distress i was in from this time my constant practice
was as soon as i rose to perform that business in open air at the full
extent of my chain and due care was taken every morning before company
came that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel barrows
by two servants appointed for that purpose i would not have dwelt so
long upon a circumstance that perhaps at first sight may appear not
very momentous if i had not thought it necessary to justify my
character in point of cleanliness to the world which i am told some
of my maligners have been pleased upon this and other occasions to call
when this adventure was at an end i came back out of my house having
occasion for fresh air the emperor was already descended from the
tower and advancing on horseback towards me which had like to have cost
him dear for the beast though very well trained yet wholly unused to
such a sight which appeared as if a mountain moved before him reared up
on its hinder feet but that prince who is an excellent horseman kept
his seat till his attendants ran in and held the bridle while his
majesty had time to dismount when he alighted he surveyed me round
with great admiration but kept beyond the length of my chain he
ordered his cooks and butlers who were already prepared to give me
victuals and drink which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon
wheels till i could reach them i took these vehicles and soon emptied
them all twenty of them were filled with meat and ten with liquor each
of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls and i emptied the
liquor of ten vessels which was contained in earthen vials into one
vehicle drinking it off at a draught and so i did with the rest the
empress and young princes of the blood of both sexes attended by many
ladies sat at some distance in their chairs but upon the accident that
happened to the emperors horse they alighted and came near his person
which i am now going to describe he is taller by almost the breadth of
my nail than any of his court which alone is enough to strike an awe
into the beholders his features are strong and masculine with an
austrian lip and arched nose his complexion olive his countenance
erect his body and limbs well proportioned all his motions graceful
and his deportment majestic he was then past his prime being
twenty eight years and three quarters old of which he had reigned about
seven in great felicity and generally victorious for the better
convenience of beholding him i lay on my side so that my face was
parallel to his and he stood but three yards off however i have had
him since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived in the
description his dress was very plain and simple and the fashion of it
between the asiatic and the european but he had on his head a light
helmet of gold adorned with jewels and a plume on the crest he held
his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if i should happen to
break loose it was almost three inches long the hilt and scabbard were
gold enriched with diamonds his voice was shrill but very clear and
articulate and i could distinctly hear it when i stood up the ladies
and courtiers were all most magnificently clad so that the spot they
stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground
embroidered with figures of gold and silver his imperial majesty spoke
often to me and i returned answers but neither of us could understand a
syllable there were several of his priests and lawyers present as i
conjectured by their habits who were commanded to address themselves to
me and i spoke to them in as many languages as i had the least
smattering of which were high and low dutch latin french spanish
italian and lingua franca but all to no purpose after about two hours
the court retired and i was left with a strong guard to prevent the
impertinence and probably the malice of the rabble who were very
impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst and some of them had
the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as i sat on the ground by the
door of my house whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye but the
colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized and thought no
punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands which some
of his soldiers accordingly did pushing them forward with the butt ends
of their pikes into my reach i took them all in my right hand put five
of them into my coat pocket and as to the sixth i made a countenance as
if i would eat him alive the poor man squalled terribly and the
colonel and his officers were in much pain especially when they saw me
take out my penknife but i soon put them out of fear for looking
mildly and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with i set him
gently on the ground and away he ran i treated the rest in the same
manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and i observed both the
soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency
which was represented very much to my advantage at court
towards night i got with some difficulty into my house where i lay on
the ground and continued to do so about a fortnight during which time
the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me six hundred beds
of the common measure were brought in carriages and worked up in my
house a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up the
breadth and length and these were four double which however kept me
but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor that was of smooth
stone by the same computation they provided me with sheets blankets
and coverlets tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to
as the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom it brought
prodigious numbers of rich idle and curious people to see me so that
the villages were almost emptied and great neglect of tillage and
household affairs must have ensued if his imperial majesty had not
provided by several proclamations and orders of state against this
inconveniency he directed that those who had already beheld me should
return home and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house
without license from the court whereby the secretaries of state got
in the mean time the emperor held frequent councils to debate what
course should be taken with me and i was afterwards assured by a
particular friend a person of great quality who was as much in the
secret as any that the court was under many difficulties concerning me
they apprehended my breaking loose that my diet would be very expensive
and might cause a famine sometimes they determined to starve me or at
least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows which would
soon despatch me but again they considered that the stench of so large
a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis and probably spread
through the whole kingdom in the midst of these consultations several
officers of the army went to the door of the great council chamber and
two of them being admitted gave an account of my behaviour to the six
criminals above mentioned which made so favourable an impression in the
breast of his majesty and the whole board in my behalf that an imperial
commission was issued out obliging all the villages nine hundred yards
round the city to deliver in every morning six beeves forty sheep and
other victuals for my sustenance together with a proportionable quantity
of bread and wine and other liquors for the due payment of which his
majesty gave assignments upon his treasury for this prince lives chiefly
upon his own demesnes seldom except upon great occasions raising any
subsidies upon his subjects who are bound to attend him in his wars at
their own expense an establishment was also made of six hundred persons
to be my domestics who had board wages allowed for their maintenance
and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door it
was likewise ordered that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of
clothes after the fashion of the country that six of his majestys
greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language
and lastly that the emperors horses and those of the nobility and
troops of guards should be frequently exercised in my sight to accustom
themselves to me all these orders were duly put in execution and in
about three weeks i made a great progress in learning their language
during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits and
was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me we began already to
converse together in some sort and the first words i learnt were to
express my desire that he would please give me my liberty which i
every day repeated on my knees his answer as i could comprehend it
was that this must be a work of time not to be thought on without the
advice of his council and that first i must lumos kelmin pesso desmar
lon emposo that is swear a peace with him and his kingdom however
that i should be used with all kindness and he advised me to acquire
by my patience and discreet behaviour the good opinion of himself and
his subjects he desired i would not take it ill if he gave orders to
certain proper officers to search me for probably i might carry about me
several weapons which must needs be dangerous things if they answered
the bulk of so prodigious a person i said his majesty should be
satisfied for i was ready to strip myself and turn up my pockets before
him this i delivered part in words and part in signs he replied
that by the laws of the kingdom i must be searched by two of his
officers that he knew this could not be done without my consent and
assistance and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice
as to trust their persons in my hands that whatever they took from me
should be returned when i left the country or paid for at the rate which
i would set upon them i took up the two officers in my hands put them
first into my coat pockets and then into every other pocket about me
except my two fobs and another secret pocket which i had no mind should
be searched wherein i had some little necessaries that were of no
consequence to any but myself in one of my fobs there was a silver
watch and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse these
gentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exact
inventory of every thing they saw and when they had done desired i
would set them down that they might deliver it to the emperor this
inventory i afterwards translated into english and is word for word as
imprimis in the right coat pocket of the great man mountain for
so i interpret the words quinbus flestrin after the strictest
search we found only one great piece of coarse cloth large enough
to be a foot cloth for your majestys chief room of state in the
left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a cover of the same
metal which we the searchers were not able to lift we desired it
should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to
the mid leg in a sort of dust some part whereof flying up to our
faces set us both a sneezing for several times together in his
right waistcoat pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin
substances folded one over another about the bigness of three men
tied with a strong cable and marked with black figures which we
humbly conceive to be writings every letter almost half as large as
the palm of our hands in the left there was a sort of engine from
the back of which were extended twenty long poles resembling the
pallisados before your majestys court wherewith we conjecture the
man mountain combs his head for we did not always trouble him with
questions because we found it a great difficulty to make him
understand us in the large pocket on the right side of his middle
cover so i translate the word ranfulo by which they meant my
breeches we saw a hollow pillar of iron about the length of a
man fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar and
upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out
cut into strange figures which we know not what to make of in the
left pocket another engine of the same kind in the smaller pocket
on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red
metal of different bulk some of the white which seemed to be
silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and i could hardly
lift them in the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly
shaped we could not without difficulty reach the top of them as
we stood at the bottom of his pocket one of them was covered and
seemed all of a piece but at the upper end of the other there
appeared a white round substance about twice the bigness of our
heads within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of
steel which by our orders we obliged him to show us because we
apprehended they might be dangerous engines he took them out of
their cases and told us that in his own country his practice was to
shave his beard with one of these and cut his meat with the other
there were two pockets which we could not enter these he called his
fobs they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover
but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly out of the right
fob hung a great silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine at the
bottom we directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that
chain which appeared to be a globe half silver and half of some
transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain
strange figures circularly drawn and thought we could touch them
till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance he put
this engine into our ears which made an incessant noise like that
of a water mill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal
or the god that he worships but we are more inclined to the latter
opinion because he assured us if we understood him right for he
expressed himself very imperfectly that he seldom did any thing
without consulting it he called it his oracle and said it pointed
out the time for every action of his life from the left fob he took
out a net almost large enough for a fisherman but contrived to open
and shut like a purse and served him for the same use we found
therein several massy pieces of yellow metal which if they be real
having thus in obedience to your majestys commands diligently
searched all his pockets we observed a girdle about his waist made
of the hide of some prodigious animal from which on the left side
hung a sword of the length of five men and on the right a bag or
pouch divided into two cells each cell capable of holding three of
your majestys subjects in one of these cells were several globes
or balls of a most ponderous metal about the bigness of our heads
and requiring a strong hand to lift them the other cell contained a
heap of certain black grains but of no great bulk or weight for we
could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands
this is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the
man mountain who used us with great civility and due respect to
your majestys commission signed and sealed on the fourth day of
the eighty ninth moon of your majestys auspicious reign
when this inventory was read over to the emperor he directed me
although in very gentle terms to deliver up the several particulars he
first called for my scimitar which i took out scabbard and all in the
mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops who then
attended him to surround me at a distance with their bows and arrows
just ready to discharge but i did not observe it for mine eyes were
wholly fixed upon his majesty he then desired me to draw my scimitar
which although it had got some rust by the sea water was in most
parts exceeding bright i did so and immediately all the troops gave a
shout between terror and surprise for the sun shone clear and the
reflection dazzled their eyes as i waved the scimitar to and fro in my
hand his majesty who is a most magnanimous prince was less daunted
than i could expect he ordered me to return it into the scabbard and
cast it on the ground as gently as i could about six feet from the end
of my chain the next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron
pillars by which he meant my pocket pistols i drew it out and at his
desire as well as i could expressed to him the use of it and charging
it only with powder which by the closeness of my pouch happened to
escape wetting in the sea an inconvenience against which all prudent
mariners take special care to provide i first cautioned the emperor not
to be afraid and then i let it off in the air the astonishment here
was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar hundreds fell down as
if they had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood his
ground could not recover himself for some time i delivered up both my
pistols in the same manner as i had done my scimitar and then my pouch
of powder and bullets begging him that the former might be kept from
fire for it would kindle with the smallest spark and blow up his
imperial palace into the air i likewise delivered up my watch which
the emperor was very curious to see and commanded two of his tallest
yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders as
draymen in england do a barrel of ale he was amazed at the continual
noise it made and the motion of the minute hand which he could easily
discern for their sight is much more acute than ours he asked the
opinions of his learned men about it which were various and remote as
the reader may well imagine without my repeating although indeed i could
not very perfectly understand them i then gave up my silver and copper
money my purse with nine large pieces of gold and some smaller ones
my knife and razor my comb and silver snuff box my handkerchief and
journal book my scimitar pistols and pouch were conveyed in
carriages to his majestys stores but the rest of my goods were returned
i had as i before observed one private pocket which escaped their
search wherein there was a pair of spectacles which i sometimes use for
the weakness of mine eyes a pocket perspective and some other little
conveniences which being of no consequence to the emperor i did not
think myself bound in honour to discover and i apprehended they might be
lost or spoiled if i ventured them out of my possession
the author diverts the emperor and his nobility of both sexes in a very
uncommon manner the diversions of the court of lilliput described the
author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions
my gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his
court and indeed upon the army and people in general that i began to
conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time i took all
possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition the natives
came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me i would
sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and at
last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide and seek
in my hair i had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking
the language the emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with
several of the country shows wherein they exceed all nations i have
known both for dexterity and magnificence i was diverted with none so
much as that of the rope dancers performed upon a slender white thread
extended about two feet and twelve inches from the ground upon which i
shall desire liberty with the readers patience to enlarge a little
this diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for
great employments and high favour at court they are trained in this
art from their youth and are not always of noble birth or liberal
education when a great office is vacant either by death or disgrace
which often happens five or six of those candidates petition the
emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope
and whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the office
very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their
skill and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty
flimnap the treasurer is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope
at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire i have
seen him do the summerset several times together upon a trencher fixed
on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in england my
friend reldresal principal secretary for private affairs is in my
opinion if i am not partial the second after the treasurer the rest of
the great officers are much upon a par
these diversions are often attended with fatal accidents whereof great
numbers are on record i myself have seen two or three candidates break
a limb but the danger is much greater when the ministers themselves
are commanded to show their dexterity for by contending to excel
themselves and their fellows they strain so far that there is hardly one
of them who has not received a fall and some of them two or three i
was assured that a year or two before my arrival flimnap would
infallibly have broke his neck if one of the kings cushions that
accidentally lay on the ground had not weakened the force of his fall
there is likewise another diversion which is only shown before the
emperor and empress and first minister upon particular occasions the
emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long
one is blue the other red and the third green these threads are
proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to
distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour the ceremony is performed
in his majestys great chamber of state where the candidates are to
undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former and such as
i have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the
new or old world the emperor holds a stick in his hands both ends
parallel to the horizon while the candidates advancing one by one
sometimes leap over the stick sometimes creep under it backward and
forward several times according as the stick is advanced or depressed
sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick and his first minister
the other sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself whoever
performs his part with most agility and holds out the longest in leaping
and creeping is rewarded with the blue coloured silk the red is given
to the next and the green to the third which they all wear girt twice
round about the middle and you see few great persons about this court
who are not adorned with one of these girdles
the horses of the army and those of the royal stables having been daily
led before me were no longer shy but would come up to my very feet
without starting the riders would leap them over my hand as i held it
on the ground and one of the emperors huntsmen upon a large courser
took my foot shoe and all which was indeed a prodigious leap i had
the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary
manner i desired he would order several sticks of two feet high and
the thickness of an ordinary cane to be brought me whereupon his
majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly
and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages drawn by
eight horses to each i took nine of these sticks and fixing them
firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure two feet and a half
square i took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each corner
about two feet from the ground then i fastened my handkerchief to the
nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was
tight as the top of a drum and the four parallel sticks rising about
five inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side
when i had finished my work i desired the emperor to let a troop of his
best horses twenty four in number come and exercise upon this plain
his majesty approved of the proposal and i took them up one by one in
my hands ready mounted and armed with the proper officers to exercise
them as soon as they got into order they divided into two parties
performed mock skirmishes discharged blunt arrows drew their swords
fled and pursued attacked and retired and in short discovered the best
military discipline i ever beheld the parallel sticks secured them and
their horses from falling over the stage and the emperor was so much
delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several
days and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command
and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me
hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage when she was
able to take a full view of the whole performance it was my good
fortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments only once
a fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his
hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and his foot slipping he
overthrew his rider and himself but i immediately relieved them both
and covering the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the other
in the same manner as i took them up the horse that fell was strained in
the left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and i repaired my
handkerchief as well as i could however i would not trust to the
strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises
