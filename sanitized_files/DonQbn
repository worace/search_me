replied de donde diere but putting this aside tell me sancho hast
thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to night and wouldst thou
rather have it indoors or in the open air
egad senor said sancho for what im going to give myself it comes
all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields still id
like it to be among trees for i think they are company for me and help
and yet it must not be sancho my friend said don quixote but to
enable thee to recover strength we must keep it for our own village for
at the latest we shall get there the day after tomorrow
sancho said he might do as he pleased but that for his own part he would
like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while
he had an appetite because in delay there is apt to be danger very
often and praying to god and plying the hammer and one take was
better than two ill give thees and a sparrow in the hand than a
for gods sake sancho no more proverbs exclaimed don quixote it
seems to me thou art becoming sicut erat again speak in a plain simple
straight forward way as i have often told thee and thou wilt find the
i dont know what bad luck it is of mine argument to my mind however
i mean to mend said sancho but i cant utter a word without a proverb
that is not as good as an argument to my mind however i mean to mend if
i can and so for the present the conversation ended
of how don quixote and sancho reached their village
all that day don quixote and sancho remained in the village and inn
waiting for night the one to finish off his task of scourging in the
open country the other to see it accomplished for therein lay the
accomplishment of his wishes meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a
traveller on horseback with three or four servants one of whom said to
him who appeared to be the master here senor don alvaro tarfe your
worship may take your siesta to day the quarters seem clean and cool
when he heard this don quixote said to sancho look here sancho on
turning over the leaves of that book of the second part of my history i
think i came casually upon this name of don alvaro tarfe
very likely said sancho we had better let him dismount and
by and by we can ask about it
the gentleman dismounted and the landlady gave him a room on the ground
floor opposite don quixotes and adorned with painted serge hangings of
the same sort the newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat and
coming out to the gateway of the hostelry which was wide and cool
addressing don quixote who was pacing up and down there he asked in
to a village near this which is my own village replied don quixote
and your worship where are you bound for
i am going to granada senor said the gentleman to my own country
and a goodly country said don quixote but will your worship do me
the favour of telling me your name for it strikes me it is of more
importance to me to know it than i can tell you
my name is don alvaro tarfe replied the traveller
to which don quixote returned i have no doubt whatever that your
worship is that don alvaro tarfe who appears in print in the second part
of the history of don quixote of la mancha lately printed and published
i am the same replied the gentleman and that same don quixote the
principal personage in the said history was a very great friend of mine
and it was i who took him away from home or at least induced him to come
to some jousts that were to be held at saragossa whither i was going
myself indeed i showed him many kindnesses and saved him from having
his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme
tell me senor don alvaro said don quixote am i at all like that don
no indeed replied the traveller not a bit
and that don quixote  said our one had he with him a squire called
he had said don alvaro but though he had the name of being very
droll i never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it
that i can well believe said sancho at this for to come out with
drolleries is not in everybodys line and that sancho your worship
speaks of gentle sir must be some great scoundrel dunderhead and
thief all in one for i am the real sancho panza and i have more
drolleries than if it rained them let your worship only try come along
with me for a year or so and you will find they fall from me at every
turn and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly i dont know what i
am saying i make everybody that hears me laugh and the real don quixote
of la mancha the famous the valiant the wise the lover the righter
of wrongs the guardian of minors and orphans the protector of widows
the killer of damsels he who has for his sole mistress the peerless
dulcinea del toboso is this gentleman before you my master all other
don quixotes and all other sancho panzas are dreams and mockeries
by god i believe it said don alvaro for you have uttered more
drolleries my friend in the few words you have spoken than the other
sancho panza in all i ever heard from him and they were not a few he
was more greedy than well spoken and more dull than droll and i am
convinced that the enchanters who persecute don quixote the good have
been trying to persecute me with don quixote the bad but i dont know
what to say for i am ready to swear i left him shut up in the casa del
nuncio at toledo and here another don quixote turns up though a very
i dont know whether i am good said don quixote but i can safely say
i am not the bad and to prove it let me tell you senor don alvaro
tarfe i have never in my life been in saragossa so far from that when
it was told me that this imaginary don quixote had been present at the
jousts in that city i declined to enter it in order to drag his
falsehood before the face of the world and so i went on straight to
barcelona the treasure house of courtesy haven of strangers asylum of
the poor home of the valiant champion of the wronged pleasant exchange
of firm friendships and city unrivalled in site and beauty and though
the adventures that befell me there are not by any means matters of
enjoyment but rather of regret i do not regret them simply because i
have seen it in a word senor don alvaro tarfe i am don quixote of la
mancha the one that fame speaks of and not the unlucky one that has
attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my ideas i entreat
your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good as to make a
declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never in all your
life saw me until now and that neither am i the don quixote in print in
the second part nor this sancho panza my squire the one your worship
that i will do most willingly replied don alvaro though it amazes me
to find two don quixotes and two sancho panzas at once as much alike in
name as they differ in demeanour and again i say and declare that what i
saw i cannot have seen and that what happened me cannot have happened
no doubt your worship is enchanted like my lady dulcinea del toboso
said sancho and would to heaven your disenchantment rested on my giving
myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what im giving myself
for her for id lay them on without looking for anything
i dont understand that about the lashes said don alvaro sancho
replied that it was a long story to tell but he would tell him if they
by this dinner time arrived and don quixote and don alvaro dined
together the alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together
with a notary and don quixote laid a petition before him showing that
it was requisite for his rights that don alvaro tarfe the gentleman
there present should make a declaration before him that he did not know
don quixote of la mancha also there present and that he was not the one
that was in print in a history entitled second part of don quixote of la
mancha by one avellaneda of tordesillas the alcalde finally put it in
legal form and the declaration was made with all the formalities
required in such cases at which don quixote and sancho were in high
delight as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to
them and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference
between the two don quixotes and the two sanchos many civilities and
offers of service were exchanged by don alvaro and don quixote in the
course of which the great manchegan displayed such good taste that he
disabused don alvaro of the error he was under and he on his part felt
convinced he must have been enchanted now that he had been brought in
evening came they set out from the village and after about half a
league two roads branched off one leading to don quixotes village the
other the road don alvaro was to follow in this short interval don
quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat and of dulcineas enchantment
and the remedy all which threw don alvaro into fresh amazement and
embracing don quixote and sancho he went his way and don quixote went
his that night he passed among trees again in order to give sancho an
opportunity of working out his penance which he did in the same fashion
as the night before at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much
more than of his back of which he took such good care that the lashes
would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there the duped don
quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count and he found that
together with those of the night before they made up three thousand and
twenty nine the sun apparently had got up early to witness the
sacrifice and with his light they resumed their journey discussing the
deception practised on don alvaro and saying how well done it was to
have taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable
form that day and night they travelled on nor did anything worth
mention happen them unless it was that in the course of the night sancho
finished off his task whereat don quixote was beyond measure joyful he
watched for daylight to see if along the road he should fall in with his
already disenchanted lady dulcinea and as he pursued his journey there
was no woman he met that he did not go up to to see if she was dulcinea
del toboso as he held it absolutely certain that merlins promises could
not lie full of these thoughts and anxieties they ascended a rising
ground wherefrom they descried their own village at the sight of which
sancho fell on his knees exclaiming open thine eyes longed for home
and see how thy son sancho panza comes back to thee if not very rich
very well whipped open thine arms and receive too thy son don quixote
who if he comes vanquished by the arm of another comes victor over
himself which as he himself has told me is the greatest victory anyone
can desire im bringing back money for if i was well whipped i went
have done with these fooleries said don quixote let us push on
straight and get to our own place where we will give free range to our
fancies and settle our plans for our future pastoral life
with this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their
of the omens don quixote had as he entered his own village and other
incidents that embellish and give a colour to this great history
at the entrance of the village so says cide hamete don quixote saw two
boys quarrelling on the village threshing floor one of whom said to the
other take it easy periquillo thou shalt never see it again as long
don quixote heard this and said he to sancho dost thou not mark
friend what that boy said thou shalt never see it again as long as
well said sancho what does it matter if the boy said so
what said don quixote dost thou not see that applied to the object
of my desires the words mean that i am never to see dulcinea more
sancho was about to answer when his attention was diverted by seeing a
hare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and
sportsmen in its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under
dapple sancho caught it alive and presented it to don quixote who was
saying malum signum malum signum a hare flies greyhounds chase it
your worships a strange man said sancho lets take it for granted
that this hare is dulcinea and these greyhounds chasing it the malignant
enchanters who turned her into a country wench she flies and i catch
her and put her into your worships hands and you hold her in your arms
and cherish her what bad sign is that or what ill omen is there to be
the two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare and
sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about he was answered by
the one who had said thou shalt never see it again as long as thou
livest that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other boy
and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived sancho took
out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the cage
which he placed in don quixotes hands saying there senor there are
the omens broken and destroyed and they have no more to do with our
affairs to my thinking fool as i am than with last years clouds and
if i remember rightly i have heard the curate of our village say that it
does not become christians or sensible people to give any heed to these
silly things and even you yourself said the same to me some time ago
telling me that all christians who minded omens were fools but theres
no need of making words about it let us push on and go into our
the sportsmen came up and asked for their hare which don quixote gave
them they then went on and upon the green at the entrance of the town
they came upon the curate and the bachelor samson carrasco busy with
their breviaries it should be mentioned that sancho had thrown by way
of a sumpter cloth over dapple and over the bundle of armour the
buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the
dukes castle the night altisidora came back to life he had also fixed
the mitre on dapples head the oddest transformation and decoration that
ever ass in the world underwent they were at once recognised by both the
curate and the bachelor who came towards them with open arms don
quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace and the boys
who are lynxes that nothing escapes spied out the asss mitre and came
running to see it calling out to one another come here boys and see
sancho panzas ass figged out finer than mingo and don quixotes beast
so at length with the boys capering round them and accompanied by the
curate and the bachelor they made their entrance into the town and
proceeded to don quixotes house at the door of which they found his
housekeeper and niece whom the news of his arrival had already reached
it had been brought to teresa panza sanchos wife as well and she with
her hair all loose and half naked dragging sanchica her daughter by the
hand ran out to meet her husband but seeing him coming in by no means
as good case as she thought a governor ought to be she said to him how
is it you come this way husband it seems to me you come tramping and
footsore and looking more like a disorderly vagabond than a governor
hold your tongue teresa said sancho often where there are pegs
there are no flitches lets go into the house and there youll hear
strange things i bring money and thats the main thing got by my own
you bring the money my good husband said teresa and no matter
whether it was got this way or that for however you may have got it
youll not have brought any new practice into the world
sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything
for she had been looking out for him as for the showers of may and she
taking hold of him by the girdle on one side and his wife by the hand
while the daughter led dapple they made for their house leaving don
quixote in his in the hands of his niece and housekeeper and in the
don quixote at once without any regard to time or season withdrew in
private with the bachelor and the curate and in a few words told them of
his defeat and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village
for a year which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a
hairs breadth from it as became a knight errant bound by scrupulous
good faith and the laws of knight errantry and of how he thought of
turning shepherd for that year and taking his diversion in the solitude
of the fields where he could with perfect freedom give range to his
thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling and he
besought them if they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented
by more important business to consent to be his companions for he would
buy sheep enough to qualify them for shepherds and the most important
point of the whole affair he could tell them was settled for he had
given them names that would fit them to a t the curate asked what they
were don quixote replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd
quixotize and the bachelor the shepherd carrascon and the curate the
shepherd curambro and sancho panza the shepherd pancino
both were astounded at don quixotes new craze however lest he should
once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his
chivalry they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured
fell in with his new project applauded his crazy idea as a bright one
and offered to share the life with him and whats more said samson
carrasco i am as all the world knows a very famous poet and ill be
always making verses pastoral or courtly or as it may come into my
head to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be
roaming but what is most needful sirs is that each of us should choose
the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses and that
we should not leave a tree be it ever so hard without writing up and
carving her name on it as is the habit and custom of love smitten
thats the very thing said don quixote though i am relieved from
looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess for theres the
peerless dulcinea del toboso the glory of these brooksides the ornament
of these meadows the mainstay of beauty the cream of all the graces
and in a word the being to whom all praise is appropriate be it ever
very true said the curate but we the others must look about for
accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or
and added samson carrasco if they fail us we can call them by the
names of the ones in print that the world is filled with filidas
amarilises dianas fleridas galateas belisardas for as they sell them
in the market places we may fairly buy them and make them our own if my
lady or i should say my shepherdess happens to be called ana ill sing
her praises under the name of anarda and if francisca ill call her
francenia and if lucia lucinda for it all comes to the same thing and
sancho panza if he joins this fraternity may glorify his wife teresa
don quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name and the curate
bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had
made and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could
spare from his imperative duties and so they took their leave of him
recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat
it so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of
them said and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to don
quixote and said the niece whats this uncle now that we were
thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable
life there are you going to get into fresh entanglements and turn
young shepherd thou that comest here young shepherd going there nay
indeed the straw is too hard now to make pipes of
and added the housekeeper will your worship be able to bear out in
the fields the heats of summer and the chills of winter and the
howling of the wolves not you for thats a life and a business for
hardy men bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they were
in swaddling clothes why to make choice of evils its better to be a
knight errant than a shepherd look here senor take my advice and im
not giving it to you full of bread and wine but fasting and with fifty
years upon my head stay at home look after your affairs go often to
confession be good to the poor and upon my soul be it if any evil comes
hold your peace my daughters said don quixote i know very well what
my duty is help me to bed for i dont feel very well and rest assured
that knight errant now or wandering shepherd to be i shall never fail
to have a care for your interests as you will see in the end and the
good wenches for that they undoubtedly were the housekeeper and niece
helped him to bed where they gave him something to eat and made him as
of how don quixote fell sick and of the will he made and how he died
as nothing that is mans can last for ever but all tends ever downwards
from its beginning to its end and above all mans life and as don
quixotes enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course
its end and close came when he least looked for it for whether it was of
the dejection the thought of his defeat produced or of heavens will
that so ordered it a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for
six days during which he was often visited by his friends the curate
the bachelor and the barber while his good squire sancho panza never
quitted his bedside they persuaded that it was grief at finding himself
vanquished and the object of his heart the liberation and
disenchantment of dulcinea unattained that kept him in this state
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up the bachelor
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life for which
he himself he said had already composed an eclogue that would take the
shine out of all sannazaro had ever written and had bought with his own
money two famous dogs to guard the flock one called barcino and the
other butron which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him
but for all this don quixote could not shake off his sadness his friends
called in the doctor who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied
with it and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to
the health of his soul as that of his body was in a bad way don quixote
heard this calmly but not so his housekeeper his niece and his squire
who fell weeping bitterly as if they had him lying dead before them the
doctors opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to
his end don quixote begged them to leave him to himself as he had a
wish to sleep a little they obeyed and he slept at one stretch as the
saying is more than six hours so that the housekeeper and niece thought
he was going to sleep for ever but at the end of that time he woke up
and in a loud voice exclaimed blessed be almighty god who has shown me
such goodness in truth his mercies are boundless and the sins of men
can neither limit them nor keep them back
the niece listened with attention to her uncles words and they struck
her as more coherent than what usually fell from him at least during his
illness so she asked what are you saying senor has anything strange
occurred what mercies or what sins of men are you talking of
the mercies niece said don quixote are those that god has this
moment shown me and with him as i said my sins are no impediment to
them my reason is now free and clear rid of the dark shadows of
ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of
chivalry cast over it now i see through their absurdities and
deceptions and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions
has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading
other books that might be a light to my soul niece i feel myself at the
point of death and i would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my
life has not been so ill that i should leave behind me the name of a
madman for though i have been one i would not that the fact should be
made plainer at my death call in to me my dear my good friends the
curate the bachelor samson carrasco and master nicholas the barber for
i wish to confess and make my will but his niece was saved the trouble
by the entrance of the three the instant don quixote saw them he
exclaimed good news for you good sirs that i am no longer don quixote
of la mancha but alonso quixano whose way of life won for him the name
of good now am i the enemy of amadis of gaul and of the whole countless
troop of his descendants odious to me now are all the profane stories of
knight errantry now i perceive my folly and the peril into which
reading them brought me now by gods mercy schooled into my right
when the three heard him speak in this way they had no doubt whatever
that some new craze had taken possession of him and said samson what
senor don quixote now that we have intelligence of the lady dulcinea
being disenchanted are you taking this line now just as we are on the
point of becoming shepherds to pass our lives singing like princes are
you thinking of turning hermit hush for heavens sake be rational and
all that nonsense said don quixote that until now has been a reality
to my hurt my death will with heavens help turn to my good i feel
sirs that i am rapidly drawing near death a truce to jesting let me
have a confessor to confess me and a notary to make my will for in
extremities like this man must not trifle with his soul and while the
curate is confessing me let some one i beg go for the notary
they looked at one another wondering at don quixotes words but though
uncertain they were inclined to believe him and one of the signs by
which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden and
complete return to his senses after having been mad for to the words
already quoted he added much more so well expressed so devout and so
rational as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound of
mind the curate turned them all out and left alone with him confessed
him the bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards
with him and with sancho who having already learned from the bachelor
the condition his master was in and finding the housekeeper and niece
the confession over the curate came out saying alonso quixano the good
is indeed dying and is indeed in his right mind we may now go in to him
this news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the
housekeeper niece and sancho panza his good squire making the tears
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts for of a
truth as has been said more than once whether as plain alonso quixano
the good or as don quixote of la mancha don quixote was always of a
gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways and hence he was beloved
not only by those of his own house but by all who knew him
the notary came in with the rest and as soon as the preamble of the had
been set out and don quixote had commended his soul to god with all the
devout formalities that are usual coming to the bequests he said
item it is my will that touching certain moneys in the hands of sancho
panza whom in my madness i made my squire inasmuch as between him and
me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits no claim be
made against him nor any account demanded of him in respect of them but
that if anything remain over and above after he has paid himself what i
owe him the balance which will be but little shall be his and much
good may it do him and if as when i was mad i had a share in giving him
the government of an island so now that i am in my senses i could give
him that of a kingdom it should be his for the simplicity of his
character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it and then turning
to sancho he said forgive me my friend that i led thee to seem as
mad as myself making thee fall into the same error i myself fell into
that there were and still are knights errant in the world
ah said sancho weeping dont die master but take my advice and
live many years for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is to
let himself die without rhyme or reason without anybody killing him or
any hands but melancholys making an end of him come dont be lazy but
get up from your bed and let us take to the fields in shepherds trim as
we agreed perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady dulcinea
disenchanted as fine as fine can be if it be that you are dying of
vexation at having been vanquished lay the blame on me and say you were
overthrown because i had girthed rocinante badly besides you must have
seen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to
upset one another and for him who is conquered to day to be conqueror
very true said samson and good sancho panzas view of these cases is
sirs not so fast said don quixote in last years nests there are
no birds this year i was mad now i am in my senses i was don quixote
of la mancha i am now as i said alonso quixano the good and may my
repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for
item i leave all my property absolutely to antonia quixana my niece
here present after all has been deducted from the most available portion
of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests i have made and the
first disbursement i desire to be made is the payment of the wages i owe
for the time my housekeeper has served me with twenty ducats over and
above for a gown the curate and the bachelor samson carrasco now
item it is my wish that if antonia quixana my niece desires to marry
she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained by
information taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are and
if it should be proved that he does and if in spite of this my niece
insists upon marrying him and does marry him then that she shall
forfeit the whole of what i have left her which my executors shall
devote to works of charity as they please
item i entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors that if any happy
chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have
written a history now going about under the title of second part of the
achievements of don quixote of la mancha they beg of him on my behalf
as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been without intending
it the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous absurdities as he
has written in it for i am leaving the world with a feeling of
compunction at having provoked him to write them
with this he closed his will and a faintness coming over him he
stretched himself out at full length on the bed all were in a flutter
and made haste to relieve him and during the three days he lived after
that on which he made his will he fainted away very often the house was
all in confusion but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and
sancho panza enjoyed himself for inheriting property wipes out or
softens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be
at last don quixotes end came after he had received all the sacraments
and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of
chivalry the notary was there at the time and he said that in no book
of chivalry had he ever read of any knight errant dying in his bed so
calmly and so like a christian as don quixote who amid the tears and
lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit that is to say died
on perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that alonso
quixano the good commonly called don quixote of la mancha had passed
away from this present life and died naturally and said he desired this
testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save
cide hamete benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making
such was the end of the ingenious gentleman of la mancha whose village
cide hamete would not indicate precisely in order to leave all the towns
and villages of la mancha to contend among themselves for the right to
adopt him and claim him as a son as the seven cities of greece contended
for homer the lamentations of sancho and the niece and housekeeper are
omitted here as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb samson carrasco
in that last hour to make him quail
and at his feats the world was scared
and said most sage cide hamete to his pen rest here hung up by this
brass wire upon this shelf o my pen whether of skilful make or clumsy
cut i know not here shalt thou remain long ages hence unless
presumptuous or malignant story tellers take thee down to profane thee
but ere they touch thee warn them and as best thou canst say to them
for me alone was don quixote born and i for him it was his to act mine
to write we two together make but one notwithstanding and in spite of
that pretended tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venture
with his great coarse ill trimmed ostrich quill to write the
achievements of my valiant knight no burden for his shoulders nor
subject for his frozen wit whom if perchance thou shouldst come to know
him thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering
bones of don quixote and not to attempt to carry him off in opposition
to all the privileges of death to old castile making him rise from the
grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length
powerless to make any third expedition or new sally for the two that he
has already made so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to
whom they have become known in this as well as in foreign countries are
quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of
those made by the whole set of the knights errant and so doing shalt
thou discharge thy christian calling giving good counsel to one that
bears ill will to thee and i shall remain satisfied and proud to have
been the first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as
he could desire for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to
the detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of
chivalry which thanks to that of my true don quixote are even now
tottering and doubtless doomed to fall for ever farewell
