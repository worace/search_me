its a bad business said the general without answering him our men
hadnt i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitski
yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that
had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they
are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected
he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle
ill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched
him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill
now then lets see how far it will carry captain just try said the
general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the
in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening
metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke
the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly
visible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully
out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and
the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
two of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge where
there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who had
alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps
behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince
nesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and
pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile
what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow you
cant wait a moment dont you see the general wants to pass
but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at
the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to the
left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to
shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense
mass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisy
little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of
the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally
uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos
knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with
broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a
type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along
sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot
an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and
sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or companys
baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides
its as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are there
a million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat with
a wink and passed on followed by another an old man
if he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now said
the old soldier dismally to a comrade youll forget to scratch
that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart
where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly
running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it
and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who
and then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end
of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily
yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh
and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had been
struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it
bah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think theyll all
be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully
as it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier with
an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like dying
of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said he as if
that one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
before it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and
seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with
a large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned
baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks
were sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives were
allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers
turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face bore
almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the women
just see the german sausage is making tracks too
sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german who
angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes
see how smart shes made herself oh the devils
there fedotov you should be quartered on them
i have seen as much before now mate
where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an
apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl
the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand
take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple
the girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on the
bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed when
they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same
kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of a
convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole
and why are they stopping theres no proper order said the soldiers
where are you shoving to devil take you cant you wait itll be
worse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammed in too
different voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at one
another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge
looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski
suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching
just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking
encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily
the crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball
hey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out of the
with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting
continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those
nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
nesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind
nesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated by
the living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggy with
his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over
tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisov
evidently in a fit of rage his coal black eyes with their bloodshot
whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
ah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski whats up with you
the squadwon cant pass shouted vaska denisov showing his white
teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitched
its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam
from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and
apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him what
is this theyre like sheep just like sheep out of the way let us
pass stop there you devil with the cart ill hack you with my
saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and
the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and
hows it youre not drunk today said nesvitski when the other had
they dont even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov they
keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to fight
lets fight but the devil knows what this is
what a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at denisovs new
denisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
a smell of perfume and put it to nesvitskis nose
of course im going into action ive shaved bwushed my teeth and
the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack and the
determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted
frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to
the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the
bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order
having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge
carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw
nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping
resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in
front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge
the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill will
estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in
smart lads only fit for a fair said one
what good are they theyre led about just for show remarked another
dont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing
horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers
id like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine
cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud
off his face with his sleeve perched up there youre more like a bird
there now zikin they ought to put you on a horse youd look fine
said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
take a stick between your legs thatll suit you for a horse the
the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last
the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last
battalion came onto the bridge only denisovs squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could
be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at
the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high
ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the
french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all
the officers and men of denisovs squadron though they tried to talk of
other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was
there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches
appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemys troops the
weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly
upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and at
intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred
yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that
stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates
two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt
one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and
what is there who is there there beyond that field that tree that
roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear
and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must
be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will
inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are
strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such
excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels
anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a
particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and
a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the
hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole
squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon
ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls
with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound
of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its
rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the
ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers
without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their
comrades impression every face from denisovs to that of the bugler
showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement
around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the
soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every
time a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on his rook a
handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a schoolboy
called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels
sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a
clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat
under fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication of
something new and stern showed round the mouth
whos that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not wight look at
me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning
the black hairy snub nosed face of vaska denisov and his whole short
sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he
held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did
especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was
only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when
they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good
horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle
he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse
voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the
staff captain on his broad backed steady mare came at a walk to meet
him his face with its long mustache was serious as always only his
well what about it said he to denisov it wont come to a fight
the devil only knows what theyre about muttered denisov ah
wostov he cried noticing the cadets bright face youve got it at
and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt
perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisov
your excellency let us attack them ill dwive them off
attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his
face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping
here dont you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron
the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front
line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side
the two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the
hill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert came
up to denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feeling
that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the
colonels athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red
neck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to
notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courage
so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to
him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next
he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack
just to punish him rostov then he imagined how after the attack
bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously
the high shouldered figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as he
had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after his
dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment
saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get
more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in
attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came
to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard
colonel he said addressing rostovs enemy with an air of gloomy
gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop
an order to who asked the colonel morosely
i dont myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone
but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars
zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitski
came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
hows this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to fire
the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside
themselves over there and one cant make anything out
the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski
you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said
but my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap and
smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand wasnt i
telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put
i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to
burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly
to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn i
ah thats always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand
how did you get here said he turning to zherkov
on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out
you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an
colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick or
the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot
the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout
staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned
i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
squadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return to
there its just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes to
test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face let
him see whether i am a coward he thought
again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
appeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemy
the colonel closely to find in his face confirmation of his own
conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked as
he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of
look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him
their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the
hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men
were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he had
no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid
that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into
an orderlys charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a
thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostov
saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching
rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on
trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not
looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled
and fell on his hands the others outstripped him
at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having
ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a
rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the
better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostov shouted
whos that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come
back cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing off
his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge
why run risks captain you should dismount he said
oh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning in
meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing
together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men
with yellow shakos dark green jackets braided with cord and blue
riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was
approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue uniforms
and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery
will they burn the bridge or not wholl get there first will they get
there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range
and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops on
the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a
sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening
light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their
ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are within
he shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the suite
true enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have done
ah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars
but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he
was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you look
at things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medal
and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be
recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how
there now said the officer of the suite thats grapeshot
he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached
on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke
appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the
moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two
oh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of
the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallen
if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away
the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but
at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in
setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no
longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too
high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
rostov absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on the
bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he had
always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the
bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a
rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest
to him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to him with
the others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized the
oooh for christs sake let me alone cried the wounded man but still
he was lifted and laid on the stretcher
nicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something gazed
into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the
sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep how
bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter the
waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway
blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and
the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peace
and happiness i should wish for nothing else nothing if only i
were there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshine there
is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this
uncertainty and hurry there they are shouting again and again are
all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it death is
here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see
at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other
stretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and of
the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one
o lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect
the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices
sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight
well fwiend so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just above
its all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought rostov and
sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting one foot
yes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks and
its nasty work an attacks pleasant work hacking away at the dogs
but this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you like
and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov composed of
the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suite
well it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this was
true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which
the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced
heres something for you to report said zherkov see if i dont get
inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel
a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded
and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and
pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness
pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command
of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it
losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
been foreseen the russian army of thirty five thousand men commanded by
kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where
overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment
there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the
courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the
russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had
joined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army and
kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the
defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an
offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the
modern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was in
vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable
aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm
on the twenty eighth of october kutuzov with his army crossed to the
left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with
the river between himself and the main body of the french on the
thirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the left bank
and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken
banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a
fortnights retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had
not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troops
were ill clad exhausted and had lost a third of their number in
killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and
wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter
in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though
the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military
hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the
stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of
the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters
most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of
prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian
general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been
wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark
of the commander in chiefs special favor he was sent with the news of
this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was
threatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicate
build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at
krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sent
meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion
the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that
had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his
impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the
impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the send off
given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers prince
andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
man who has at length begun to attain a long desired happiness as soon
as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the
russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he
quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that
this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he
again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was
thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides
of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages
at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded the
russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the
long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being
jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian
words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked
silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy
prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube
answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the
thats for them all he said to the officer who came up
get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers theres
what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a
good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on
it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved
streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the
lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that
atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night
prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer
dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual
questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he
expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance
to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance
to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find
the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the
the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went
in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing
with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a
corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the
adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger
prince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the ministers room he felt offended and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the
adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably
think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed
disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly
deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the
minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil
notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice
of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bent
bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without
raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps
take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the
papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger
prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzovs army interested
the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned
with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that
impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he
thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them
evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive
head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent
expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which
does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is
from general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good news
there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time
he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity
having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not
captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought good
news though schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the victory
his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank you
you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade
the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking
au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see
when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and
happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the
whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed
the memory of a remote event long past
prince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin a russian acquaintance of
ah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor said
bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the princes
things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonski
in so youre a messenger of victory eh splendid and i am sitting
after washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomats
luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin
after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince
andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant
after his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian for
they were speaking french at least with a russian who would he
supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was
bilibin was a man of thirty five a bachelor and of the same circle as
prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but
had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov
just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in
the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gave
promise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but no
longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of
sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a rather
important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador
in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many
diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities
avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those who
liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would
sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked well
whatever the import of his work it was not the question what for but
the question how that interested him what the diplomatic matter
might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantly
bilibins services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for
his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres
bilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be made
elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say
something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original
finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the
inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so
that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
drawing room and in fact bilibins witticisms were hawked about in
the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always
looked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after a
russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep
wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small deep set eyes always
well now tell me about your exploits said he
bolkonski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the
engagement and his reception by the minister of war
they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared
cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance
and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime que
je professe pour the orthodox russian army javoue que votre victoire
 but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russian
army i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious
he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words in
russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis
come now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and
his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingers
but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say without
boasting that it was a little better than at ulm
why didnt you capture one just one marshal for us
because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of
a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by seven
in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon
and why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have
been there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile you
ought to have been there at seven in the morning
why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic
methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew in
i know interrupted bilibin youre thinking its very easy to take
marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but still why
didnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not only the minister
of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is
not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the
russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my
franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater true
he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
it is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonski i
confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
here beyond my feeble intelligence but i cant make it out mack loses
a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs
of life and make blunder after blunder kutuzov alone at last gains a
real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french
and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details
thats just it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsar for
russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do
we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nice
news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one archdukes as
good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade
of bonapartes that will be another story and well fire off some
cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the
archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself
you abandon vienna give up its defense as much as to say heaven is
with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we
all loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us
on the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could not
have been conceived its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose
besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke
karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course
of events its too late now when vienna is occupied by the french
not only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the count our
dear count vrbna goes to him for orders
after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and
especially after having dined bolkonski felt that he could not take in
the full significance of the words he heard
count lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continued and
showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully
described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your
victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be
really i dont care about that i dont care at all said prince
andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems
was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of
austrias capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and
its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports that
prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending
us doing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but
vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i
hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow
it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of
bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour
but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said prince
