and so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful
this letter was brought to pierres house when he was on the field of
toward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having run down from
raevskis battery a second time made his way through a gully to
knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station and
seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled in
the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return
to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own
bed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be
able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such
ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found
though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he
was going still on all sides there was what there had been on the field
of battle there were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimes
strangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiers
overcoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now still
aroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dust
having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road pierre sat down
dusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay leaning on
his elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
toward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up he
had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night three
soldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and began
the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burn
and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and
put a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
the smell of smoke pierre sat up and sighed the three soldiers were
eating and talking among themselves taking no notice of him
and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently
meaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you want to eat
well give you some food only let us know whether you are an honest
i i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize his social
position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
better understood by them by rights i am a militia officer but my men
are not here i came to the battle and have lost them
would you like a little mash the first soldier asked and handed
pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean
pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash as they called
the food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food
he had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it helping himself
to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another his face was lit up by
the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence
where have you to go to tell us said one of them
well then peter kirilych come along with us well take you there
in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk
by the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill
into the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with the
soldiers quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
and that he had already passed it he would not soon have remembered
this such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up the
hill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in the town
and was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in the
your excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how is
it you are on foot and where are you going please
so youve found your folk said one of them well good by peter
good bye peter kirilych pierre heard the other voices repeat
good bye he said and turned with his groom toward the inn
i ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocket
there was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied
pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all lay
scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
falling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality
he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans
and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and
dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and
lifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only
someones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mud
and talked to the innkeeper above pierres head some pigeons disturbed
by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof
of the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful
smell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see
the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses
thank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his head
again oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded
to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the
they in pierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at the
battery those who had given him food and those who had prayed before
the icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood out
to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to
enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what
they are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my
outer man there was a time when i could have done it i could have run
away from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve
as a soldier after the duel with dolokhov and the memory of the dinner
at the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flashed through
pierres mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok and now
a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind
it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him
sat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor but
he died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he was
alive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is alive
again on one side of the table sat anatole dolokhov nesvitski
denisov and others like them in his dream the category to which these
men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those
he termed they and he heard those people anatole and dolokhov
shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of his
benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words
was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but
pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactor
was saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quite
distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and the
possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind
firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were
kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to
speak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment his
he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak
had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre
opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but
now they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dew
it is dawn thought pierre but thats not what i want i want to
hear and understand my benefactors words again he covered himself up
with his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there
there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that
someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating
afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that
someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that
day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think
and express his thoughts like that when awake
to endure war is the most difficult subordination of mans freedom to
the law of god the voice had said simplicity is submission to the
will of god you cannot escape from him and they are simple they do
not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden
man can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does not
fear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would not know
his limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went
on thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul to
unite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not to
unite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughts
together is what we need yes one must harness them must harness
them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these
words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
yes one must harness it is time to harness
time to harness time to harness your excellency your excellency
some voice was repeating we must harness it is time to harness
it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone
straight into pierres face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the
middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
while carts were passing out of the gate pierre turned away with
repugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat
no i dont want that i dont want to see and understand that i want
to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream one second
more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harness
but how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the
meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed
the groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer
had come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and that
pierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went on
the troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
them there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses and
the streets were crowded with them in the streets around carts that
were to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows could
be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtaken
him to a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on the
way pierre was told of the death of his brother in law anatole and of
on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gates of
the city he was met by count rostopchins adjutant
we have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the count
wants to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at once on a
without going home pierre took a cab and drove to see the moscow
count rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer
villa at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of his house were
full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders
vasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to him
that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be
surrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants
the officials the heads of the various government departments knew
that moscow would soon be in the enemys hands just as count rostopchin
himself knew it and to escape personal responsibility they had all come
to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various
as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came
in answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier made a
despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room
while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the
various officials old and young military and civilian who were there
they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group of
men one of whom he knew after greeting pierre they continued their
if theyre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm
but as things are now one cant answer for anything
but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed
thats another matter thats necessary for the people said the
his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up with
the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where
the enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunition
have been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will
defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in
the streets do not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed
things have to be put in order and we will deal with villains in our
own way when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and
will raise the cry a day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet
so i hold my peace an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a
three pronged fork will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a
sheaf of rye tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the
mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will
have some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker i
too am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout
but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
well of course thats what we were saying replied the first
and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the
the count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very much
upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
him by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a
smile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess
i have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you
oh well you know people often invent things i only say what i
well they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that the
countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect its
possibly remarked pierre looking about him absent mindedly and who
is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant
overcoat with a big snow white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face
he thats a tradesman that is to say hes the restaurant keeper
vereshchagin perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
oh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm calm
face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor
thats not he himself thats the father of the fellow who wrote the
proclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and i
an old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a
its a complicated story you know said the adjutant that
proclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed of
it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich here
made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly sixty
three hands he asked one from whom did you get it from so and so
he went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till he
reached vereshchagin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of a
trader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it you
and the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only have
had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to some
understanding he replied from no one i made it up myself they
threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it up
myself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the man
from whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well you
know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pride
he flared up dreadfully and just think of the fellows audacity
and the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understand
not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his own
sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished
but the point is that the count was much annoyed how could you have
written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that
was lying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself but
translated it and translated it abominably because you dont even know
french you fool and what do you think no said he i have not
read any papers i made it up myself if thats so youre a traitor
and ill have you tried and youll be hanged say from whom you had
it i have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the end
of it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it he
was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now the
father has come to intercede for him but hes a good for nothing lad
you know that sort of tradesmans son a dandy and lady killer he
attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
for him thats the sort of fellow he is his father keeps a cookshop
here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of god
almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other
well he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do
in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in
when he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his face
was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was saying
something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out
ah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as soon as the short
man had left the room we have heard of your prowess but thats not
the point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons he
went on severely as though there were something wrong about it which he
nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am well
informed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and i hope
that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to
there you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs speranski and
magnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev has
been treated in the same way and so have others who on the plea of
building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and
that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful
person it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage
for his removal from town and that you have even accepted papers from
him for safe custody i like you and dont wish you any harm and as you
are only half my age i advise you as a father would to cease all
communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
but what did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierre
that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchin
if he is accused of circulating napoleons proclamation it is not
proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin and
there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before
frowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will be
punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with which
people speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you to
discuss my actions but to give you advice or an order if you prefer
it i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with
such men as klyucharev and i will knock the nonsense out of anybody
but probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so far was
not guilty of anything he added taking pierres hand in a friendly
manner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i havent time to be
polite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a
whirl well mon cher what are you doing personally
why nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the
a word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can thats
all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear good bye my dear
fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is
it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
pierre did not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and angry
when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had
come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel
of his battalion his steward his major domo and various petitioners
they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre
did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left alone
at last he opened and read his wifes letter
they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old
man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the
meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married one
must forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself on
when he awoke next morning the major domo came to inform him that a
special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchin to
know whether count bezukhov had left or was leaving the town
a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the
drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to see
them went to the back porch and out through the gate
from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of
bezukhovs household despite all the search they made saw pierre again
the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september that is
till the eve of the enemys entry into the city
after petya had joined obolenskis regiment of cossacks and left for
belaya tserkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized
with terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had both
gone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of them
might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struck
her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to
get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya or to get him
an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved
possible petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he
was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was
somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter
in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess
mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleep
dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and
conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he
got petya transferred from obolenskis regiment to bezukhovs which was
in training near moscow though petya would remain in the service this
transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one
of her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her
petya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to
places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as
nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
first born more than all her other children and even reproached herself
for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at
lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
nuisance to everybody that snub nosed petya with his merry black eyes
and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show when
he was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fighting
somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it then
his mother thought she loved him more much more than all her other
children the nearer the time came for petya to return the more uneasy
grew the countess she began to think she would never live to see such
happiness the presence of sonya of her beloved natasha or even of her
husband irritated her what do i want with them i want no one but
at the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas
he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure
remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing that
one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about petya
though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs acquaintances
had left moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to
get away as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving before
her treasure her adored petya returned on the twenty eighth of august
he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him
did not please the sixteen year old officer though she concealed from
him her intention of keeping him under her wing petya guessed her
designs and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
when with her might become womanish as he termed it to himself he
treated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in moscow attached
himself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularly
owing to the counts customary carelessness nothing was ready for their
departure by the twenty eighth of august and the carts that were to come
from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household
from the twenty eighth till the thirty first all moscow was in a bustle
and commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodino were
brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscow
and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
out by the other gates in spite of rostopchins broadsheets or because
of them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictory
rumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed
to leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had
been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave
some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the
french had been routed while others on the contrary reported that the
russian army had been destroyed some talked about the moscow militia
which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others
whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had
been seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality
though the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow
had not yet been held both those who went away and those who remained
behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be
abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and
save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break
up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as
a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life
though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole
rostov family was absorbed in various activities the head of the
family count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collecting
the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
at home about the preparations for their departure
the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with
everything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running
away from her and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all his
time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent
nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in
her presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention
of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas
i was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said the
countess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a
presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be
sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving
the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that the
princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite her
grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the
difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
was busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when they
had any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary far from
helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running
feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were
gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and
mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause
for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits because
having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fine
young man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov
where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because
natasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha was
gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
the cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also
happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others was
a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely
and petya adored her above all they were gay because there was a war
near moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were being
given out everybody was escaping going away somewhere and in general
something extraordinary was happening and that is always exciting
on saturday the thirty first of august everything in the rostovs
house seemed topsy turvy all the doors were open all the furniture was
being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been
taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and
ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out
the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was
crowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded up
the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who
had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the
yard and in the house the count had been out since morning the
countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head
petya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sonya was in
the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natasha
was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons
and scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor and
holding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which
she had worn at her first petersburg ball
natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and
several times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart was
not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except
with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood beside
sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gave
it up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found it
amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was
done and what was left had still to be packed she found it dull
dunyasha you pack you will wont you dear and when dunyasha
willingly promised to do it all for her natasha sat down on the floor
took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what
ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie
by the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the
sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natasha got up
and looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of
the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen
postilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded
natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
an end of it in each hand went out into the street
the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of the
crowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast
mats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha
moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her
handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying
then you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more
comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family
i dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak
voice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a
stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts
natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
and at once went to meet the major
may the wounded men stay in our house she asked
the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile
which one do you want maamselle said he screwing up his eyes and
natasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner
were so serious though she was still holding the ends of her
handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection
as if considering in how far the thing was possible replied in the
oh yes why not they may he said
with a slight inclination of her head natasha stepped back quickly to
mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer
they may he says they may whispered natasha
the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard and
dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the
houses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing
with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavra
kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna
never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move
into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house
there now young lady you do take things into your head even if we
put them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we must ask
natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half open door
into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and hoffmans
oh what sleep  said the countess waking up just as she was dropping
mamma darling said natasha kneeling by her mother and bringing her
face close to her mothers i am sorry forgive me ill never do it
again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have brought
some wounded here officers will you let them come they have nowhere
to go i knew youd let them come she said quickly all in one breath
what officers whom have they brought i dont understand anything
natasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly
i knew youd give permission so ill tell them and having kissed
her mother natasha got up and went to the door
in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news
weve stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation the
club is closed and the police are leaving
papa is it all right ive invited some of the wounded into the
of course it is he answered absently thats not the point i beg
you not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow we
and the count gave a similar order to the major domo and the servants
at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard he
said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that though
rostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone
to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big
the countess looked with timid horror at her sons eager excited face
as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his not
going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
engagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherland
something senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no
contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange
to leave before then and take petya with her as their protector and
defender she did not answer him but after dinner called the count
aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that very
night if possible with a womans involuntary loving cunning she who
till then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright if
they did not leave that very night without any pretense she was now
madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the
countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
dealers in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had
been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the
shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at
the drink store having received orders to do so
after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with enthusiastic
haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the
old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to the
house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
people and flurrying them still more petya directed things in the
yard sonya owing to the counts contradictory orders lost her head
and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the house
and yard shouting and disputing natasha with the ardor characteristic
of all she did suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in
the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected
some prank from her and did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and
passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because
they did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her
her first exploit which cost her immense effort and established her
authority was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable
gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natasha set to
work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up
with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china
standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the
storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it
sonya wait a bit well pack everything into these said natasha
you cant miss we have tried to said the butlers assistant
and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she
why its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases
oh wait please and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates of
kiev ware these yes these must go among the carpets she said
dont natasha leave it alone well get it all packed urged sonya
what a young lady she is remarked the major domo
but natasha would not give in she turned everything out and began
quickly repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and
unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had
been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it turned out
that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only
the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few
more things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on having
her own way she packed repacked pressed made the butlers assistant
and petya whom she had drawn into the business of packing press on the
thats enough natasha said sonya i see you were right but just
i wont cried natasha with one hand holding back the hair that hung
over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the
carpets now press petya press vasilich press hard she cried
the carpets yielded and the lid closed natasha clapping her hands
screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted
a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her
completely the count was not angry even when they told him that natasha
had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her to
ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be
corded up thanks to natashas directions the work now went on
expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable
but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could not
get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count
having put off their departure till next morning went to bed
sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing
that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskaya and mavra
kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the
rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important
man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood and was
quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver sat a venerable
old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a
please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house
will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant
well perhaps said he with a sigh we dont expect to get him home
alive we have a house of our own in moscow but its a long way from
do us the honor to come in theres plenty of everything in the
masters house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she
we dont expect to get him home we must ask the doctor
and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart
the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook his head
disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped
she invited them to take the wounded man into the house
but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him
into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss
moscows last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sunday
the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on
sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city
only two things indicated the social condition of moscow the rabble
that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd
of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials
seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the
three hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up
they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then
dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices
too that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of
gold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money and
city articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances of
carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in payment
a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five
hundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being
in the rostovs staid old fashioned house the dissolution of former
conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only
indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during
the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their
possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their
estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and
they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge
sums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening and
early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants
sent by wounded officers came to the rostovs and wounded men dragged
themselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses where
they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a
lift out of moscow the major domo to whom these entreaties were
addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused
saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity these
wounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given one
cart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts and
ones own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the wounded
and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and ones
own family so thought the major domo on his masters behalf
on waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly so
as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning
and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yard
stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the
major domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a
pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the major
domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away
well vasilich is everything ready asked the count and stroking his
bald head he looked good naturedly at the officer and the orderly and
nodded to them he liked to see new faces
well thats right as soon as the countess wakes well be off god
willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer are
