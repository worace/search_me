the splendors of destiny in these aspirations much more than in
deliberate rational coordinated ideas is the real character of a man
to be found our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us
each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance
towards the middle of this year 1831 the old woman who waited on marius
told him that his neighbors the wretched jondrette family had been
turned out of doors marius who passed nearly the whole of his days out
of the house hardly knew that he had any neighbors
because they do not pay their rent they owe for two quarters
marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer
here he said to the old woman take these twenty five francs pay
for the poor people and give them five francs and do not tell them that
it chanced that the regiment to which lieutenant theodule belonged came
to perform garrison duty in paris this inspired aunt gillenormand with
a second idea she had on the first occasion hit upon the plan of
having marius spied upon by theodule now she plotted to have theodule
at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of
a young face in the house these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to
ruin it was expedient to find another marius take it as a simple
erratum she thought such as one sees in books for marius read
a grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson in default of a lawyer
one morning when m gillenormand was about to read something in the
quotidienne his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice
father theodule is coming to present his respects to you this
then he went back to his reading thought no more of his grandnephew
who was merely some theodule or other and soon flew into a rage which
almost always happened when he read the sheet which he held although
royalist of course announced for the following day without any
softening phrases one of these little events which were of daily
occurrence at that date in paris that the students of the schools
of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon at
midday to deliberate the discussion concerned one of the questions
of the moment the artillery of the national guard and a conflict
between the minister of war and the citizens militia on the subject
of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the louvre the students were
to deliberate over this it did not take much more than this to swell
he thought of marius who was a student and who would probably go with
the rest to deliberate at midday on the place du pantheon
as he was indulging in this painful dream lieutenant theodule entered
clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois which was clever of him and
was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle gillenormand the lancer had
reasoned as follows the old druid has not sunk all his money in a life
pension it is well to disguise ones self as a civilian from time to
and in a low voice to the lieutenant
the lieutenant who was but little accustomed to such venerable
encounters stammered with some timidity good day uncle and made
a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the
military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute
ah so its you that is well sit down said the old gentleman
m gillenormand began to pace back and forth his hands in his pockets
talking aloud and twitching with his irritated old fingers at the two
watches which he wore in his two fobs
that pack of brats they convene on the place du pantheon by my life
urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday if one were to squeeze
their noses milk would burst out and they deliberate to morrow at
midday what are we coming to what are we coming to it is clear that
we are making for the abyss that is what the descamisados have brought
us to to deliberate on the citizen artillery to go and jabber in the
open air over the jibes of the national guard and with whom are they to
meet there just see whither jacobinism leads i will bet anything you
like a million against a counter that there will be no one there but
returned convicts and released galley slaves the republicans and the
galley slaves they form but one nose and one handkerchief carnot used
to say where would you have me go traitor fouche replied wherever
you please imbecile thats what the republicans are like
m gillenormand half turned his head saw theodule and went on
when one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro
why did you leave my house to go and become a republican pssst in
the first place the people want none of your republic they have common
sense they know well that there always have been kings and that there
always will be they know well that the people are only the people
after all they make sport of it of your republic do you understand
idiot is it not a horrible caprice to fall in love with pere duchesne
to make sheeps eyes at the guillotine to sing romances and play on
the guitar under the balcony of 93 its enough to make one spit on all
these young fellows such fools are they they are all alike not one
escapes it suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the
street to lose their senses the nineteenth century is poison the
first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goats
thinks himself a real scoundrel and abandons his old relatives hes
a republican hes a romantic what does that mean romantic do me the
favor to tell me what it is all possible follies a year ago they ran
to hernani now i just ask you hernani antitheses abominations
which are not even written in french and then they have cannons in the
courtyard of the louvre such are the rascalities of this age
cannons in the courtyard of the museum for what purpose do you want
to fire grape shot at the apollo belvedere what have those cartridges
to do with the venus de medici oh the young men of the present day are
all blackguards what a pretty creature is their benjamin constant and
those who are not rascals are simpletons they do all they can to make
themselves ugly they are badly dressed they are afraid of women in
the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the
girls into fits of laughter on my word of honor one would say the poor
creatures were ashamed of love they are deformed and they complete
themselves by being stupid they repeat the puns of tiercelin and
potier they have sack coats stablemens waistcoats shirts of coarse
linen trousers of coarse cloth boots of coarse leather and their
rigmarole resembles their plumage one might make use of their jargon
to put new soles on their old shoes and all this awkward batch of brats
has political opinions if you please political opinions should be
strictly forbidden they fabricate systems they recast society they
demolish the monarchy they fling all laws to the earth they put the
attic in the cellars place and my porter in the place of the king they
turn europe topsy turvy they reconstruct the world and all their love
affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as
these women climb into their carts ah marius ah you blackguard to
go and vociferate on the public place to discuss to debate to take
measures they call that measures just god disorder humbles itself
and becomes silly i have seen chaos i now see a mess students
deliberating on the national guard such a thing could not be seen
among the ogibewas nor the cadodaches savages who go naked with their
noddles dressed like a shuttlecock with a club in their paws are less
of brutes than those bachelors of arts the four penny monkeys and they
set up for judges those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate the
end of the world is come this is plainly the end of this miserable
terraqueous globe a final hiccough was required and france has emitted
it deliberate my rascals such things will happen so long as they go
and read the newspapers under the arcades of the odeon that costs them
a sou and their good sense and their intelligence and their heart and
their soul and their wits they emerge thence and decamp from their
families all newspapers are pests all even the drapeau blanc at
bottom martainville was a jacobin ah just heaven you may boast of
having driven your grandfather to despair that you may
and profiting by the fact that m gillenormand was taking breath the
there should be no other newspaper than the moniteur and no other book
it is like their sieyes a regicide ending in a senator for that is
the way they always end they give themselves a scar with the address
of thou as citizens in order to get themselves called eventually
monsieur le comte monsieur le comte as big as my arm assassins of
september the philosopher sieyes i will do myself the justice to say
that i have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all
those philosophers than of the spectacles of the grimacer of tivoli
one day i saw the senators cross the quai malplaquet in mantles of
violet velvet sown with bees with hats a la henri iv they were
hideous one would have pronounced them monkeys from the tigers court
citizens i declare to you that your progress is madness that your
humanity is a dream that your revolution is a crime that your republic
is a monster that your young and virgin france comes from the brothel
and i maintain it against all whoever you may be whether journalists
economists legists or even were you better judges of liberty of
equality and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine and that i
parbleu cried the lieutenant that is wonderfully true
m gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun wheeled round
stared lancer theodule intently in the eyes and said to him
chapter i the sobriquet mode of formation of family names
marius was at this epoch a handsome young man of medium stature
with thick and intensely black hair a lofty and intelligent brow
well opened and passionate nostrils an air of calmness and sincerity
and with something indescribably proud thoughtful and innocent over
his whole countenance his profile all of whose lines were rounded
without thereby losing their firmness had a certain germanic sweetness
which has made its way into the french physiognomy by way of alsace
and lorraine and that complete absence of angles which rendered
the sicambres so easily recognizable among the romans and which
distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race he was at that period
of life when the mind of men who think is composed in nearly equal
parts of depth and ingenuousness a grave situation being given he
had all that is required to be stupid one more turn of the key and he
might be sublime his manners were reserved cold polished not very
genial as his mouth was charming his lips the reddest and his teeth
the whitest in the world his smile corrected the severity of his face
as a whole at certain moments that pure brow and that voluptuous smile
presented a singular contrast his eyes were small but his glance was
at the period of his most abject misery he had observed that young
girls turned round when he passed by and he fled or hid with death in
his soul he thought that they were staring at him because of his old
clothes and that they were laughing at them the fact is that they
stared at him because of his grace and that they dreamed of him
this mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers by had
made him shy he chose none of them for the excellent reason that
he fled from all of them he lived thus indefinitely stupidly as
courfeyrac also said to him do not aspire to be venerable they
called each other thou it is the tendency of youthful friendships to
slip into this mode of address let me give you a piece of advice
my dear fellow dont read so many books and look a little more at the
lasses the jades have some good points about them o marius by dint of
on other occasions courfeyrac encountered him and said good morning
when courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature marius
avoided women both young and old more than ever for a week to come
nevertheless there existed in all the immensity of creation two women
whom marius did not flee and to whom he paid no attention whatever in
truth he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed
that they were women one was the bearded old woman who swept out his
chamber and caused courfeyrac to say seeing that his servant woman
wears his beard marius does not wear his own beard the other was a
sort of little girl whom he saw very often and whom he never looked at
for more than a year marius had noticed in one of the walks of the
luxembourg the one which skirts the parapet of the pepiniere a man
and a very young girl who were almost always seated side by side on the
same bench at the most solitary end of the alley on the rue de louest
side every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of
persons whose gaze is turned inwards led marius to that walk and it
was nearly every day he found this couple there the man appeared to
be about sixty years of age he seemed sad and serious his whole person
presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have
retired from the service if he had worn a decoration marius would have
said he is an ex officer he had a kindly but unapproachable air
and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one he wore
blue trousers a blue frock coat and a broad brimmed hat which always
appeared to be new a black cravat a quaker shirt that is to say it
was dazzlingly white but of coarse linen a grisette who passed near
him one day said heres a very tidy widower his hair was very
the first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated
herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted she was a sort
of child thirteen or fourteen years of age so thin as to be almost
homely awkward insignificant and with a possible promise of
handsome eyes only they were always raised with a sort of displeasing
assurance her dress was both aged and childish like the dress of the
scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino
they had the air of being father and daughter
marius scanned this old man who was not yet aged and this little
girl who was not yet a person for a few days and thereafter paid no
attention to them they on their side did not appear even to see him
they conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air the girl
chattered incessantly and merrily the old man talked but little and
at times he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity
marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk he
marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from
their bench he walked the whole length of the alley passed in front
of them then returned to the extremity whence he had come and began
again this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade
and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its
having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting that
personage and that young girl although they appeared and perhaps
because they appeared to shun all glances had naturally caused some
attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along
the pepiniere from time to time the studious after their lectures
the others after their game of billiards courfeyrac who was among the
last had observed them several times but finding the girl homely he
had speedily and carefully kept out of the way he had fled discharging
at them a sobriquet like a parthian dart impressed solely with
the childs gown and the old mans hair he had dubbed the daughter
mademoiselle lanoire and the father monsieur leblanc so that as no
one knew them under any other title this nickname became a law in the
default of any other name the students said ah monsieur leblanc is
on his bench and marius like the rest had found it convenient to
we shall follow their example and we shall say m leblanc in order to
so marius saw them nearly every day at the same hour during the first
year he found the man to his taste but the girl insipid
during the second year precisely at the point in this history which the
reader has now reached it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was
interrupted without marius himself being quite aware why and nearly
six months elapsed during which he did not set foot in the alley one
day at last he returned thither once more it was a serene summer
morning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is
fine it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the
birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blue sky of which he
caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees
he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it he
perceived still on the same bench that well known couple only when
he approached it certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that
it was no longer the same girl the person whom he now beheld was a tall
and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a
woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the
most ingenuous graces of the child a pure and fugitive moment which
can be expressed only by these two words fifteen years she had
wonderful brown hair shaded with threads of gold a brow that seemed
made of marble cheeks that seemed made of rose leaf a pale flush
an agitated whiteness an exquisite mouth whence smiles darted like
sunbeams and words like music a head such as raphael would have given
to mary set upon a neck that jean goujon would have attributed to a
venus and in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching
face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight nor
curved neither italian nor greek it was the parisian nose that is
to say spiritual delicate irregular pure which drives painters to
when marius passed near her he could not see her eyes which were
constantly lowered he saw only her long chestnut lashes permeated with
this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened
to what the white haired old man was saying to her and nothing could
be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those drooping
for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same
man a sister of the former no doubt but when the invariable habit of
his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had
examined her attentively he recognized her as the same in six months
the little girl had become a young maiden that was all nothing is more
frequent than this phenomenon there is a moment when girls blossom out
in the twinkling of an eye and become roses all at once one left
them children but yesterday today one finds them disquieting to the
this child had not only grown she had become idealized as three days
in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers six months had
sufficed to clothe her with beauty her april had arrived
one sometimes sees people who poor and mean seem to wake up pass
suddenly from indigence to luxury indulge in expenditures of all sorts
and become dazzling prodigal magnificent all of a sudden that is
the result of having pocketed an income a note fell due yesterday the
and then she was no longer the school girl with her felt hat her
merino gown her scholars shoes and red hands taste had come to her
with beauty she was a well dressed person clad with a sort of rich
and simple elegance and without affectation she wore a dress of black
damask a cape of the same material and a bonnet of white crape her
white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the
carved chinese ivory handle of a parasol and her silken shoe outlined
the smallness of her foot when one passed near her her whole toilette
as for the man he was the same as usual
the second time that marius approached her the young girl raised her
eyelids her eyes were of a deep celestial blue but in that veiled
azure there was as yet nothing but the glance of a child she looked
at marius indifferently as she would have stared at the brat running
beneath the sycamores or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the
bench and marius on his side continued his promenade and thought
he passed near the bench where the young girl sat five or six times
but without even turning his eyes in her direction
on the following days he returned as was his wont to the luxembourg
as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no
further attention to them he thought no more about the girl now that
she was beautiful than he had when she was homely he passed very near
the bench where she sat because such was his habit
one day the air was warm the luxembourg was inundated with light
and shade the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that
morning the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths
of the chestnut trees marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature
he was not thinking of anything he simply lived and breathed he passed
near the bench the young girl raised her eyes to him the two glances
what was there in the young girls glance on this occasion marius could
not have told there was nothing and there was everything it was a
she dropped her eyes and he pursued his way
what he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a
child it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened then abruptly
there comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner woe to him
that first gaze of a soul which does not as yet know itself is
like the dawn in the sky it is the awakening of something radiant
and strange nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that
unexpected gleam which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable
shadows and which is composed of all the innocence of the present and
of all the passion of the future it is a sort of undecided tenderness
which reveals itself by chance and which waits it is a snare which
the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself and in which she captures
hearts without either wishing or knowing it it is a virgin looking like
it is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance
where it falls all purities and all candors meet in that celestial
and fatal gleam which more than all the best planned tender glances of
coquettes possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming
in the depths of the soul of that sombre flower impregnated with
perfume and with poison which is called love
that evening on his return to his garret marius cast his eyes over
his garments and perceived for the first time that he had been so
slovenly indecorous and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in
the luxembourg with his every day clothes that is to say with a
hat battered near the band coarse carters boots black trousers
which showed white at the knees and a black coat which was pale at the
on the following day at the accustomed hour marius drew from his
wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new
boots he clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves a
tremendous luxury and set off for the luxembourg
on the way thither he encountered courfeyrac and pretended not to see
him courfeyrac on his return home said to his friends
i have just met marius new hat and new coat with marius inside
them he was going to pass an examination no doubt he looked utterly
on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the tour of the fountain
basin and stared at the swans then he remained for a long time in
contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould
and one of whose hips was missing near the basin there was a bourgeois
forty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding by the
hand a little urchin of five and saying to him shun excess my son
keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy marius
listened to this bourgeois then he made the circuit of the basin once
more at last he directed his course towards his alley slowly and as
if with regret one would have said that he was both forced to go there
and withheld from doing so he did not perceive it himself and thought
that he was doing as he always did
on turning into the walk he saw m leblanc and the young girl at the
other end on their bench he buttoned his coat up to the very top
pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles examined
with a certain complaisance the lustrous gleams of his trousers and
marched on the bench this march savored of an attack and certainly
of a desire for conquest so i say that he marched on the bench as i
however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had
interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors
at that moment he was thinking that the manuel du baccalaureat was
a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots to
allow of three tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being
analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind there was a piercing
whistling going on in his ears as he approached the bench he held
fast to the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes on the young girl it
seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a
in proportion as he drew near his pace slackened more and more on
arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had
reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself
why he retraced his steps he did not even say to himself that he would
not go as far as the end it was only with difficulty that the young
girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine
appearance in his new clothes nevertheless he held himself very erect
in case any one should be looking at him from behind
he attained the opposite end then came back and this time he
approached a little nearer to the bench he even got to within three
intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of
proceeding further and he hesitated he thought he saw the young girls
face bending towards him but he exerted a manly and violent effort
subdued his hesitation and walked straight ahead a few seconds later
he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very
ears without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the
left with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman at the moment
when he passed under the cannon of the place he felt his heart beat
wildly as on the preceding day she wore her damask gown and her crape
bonnet he heard an ineffable voice which must have been her voice
she was talking tranquilly she was very pretty he felt it although he
made no attempt to see her she could not however he thought help
feeling esteem and consideration for me if she only knew that i am
the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronde
which m francois de neufchateau put as though it were his own at the
head of his edition of gil blas he went beyond the bench as far as the
extremity of the walk which was very near then turned on his heel and
passed once more in front of the lovely girl this time he was very
pale moreover all his emotions were disagreeable as he went further
from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her
he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble
he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the
middle of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down
and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit
that after all it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black
gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were
on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was
surrounded by an aureole but he remained standing there motionless
for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that
gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter had on his side
noticed him and probably considered his assiduity singular
for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence in
designating that stranger even in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet
he stood thus for several minutes with drooping head tracing figures
in the sand with the cane which he held in his hand
then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench to m
that day he forgot to dine at eight oclock in the evening he perceived
this fact and as it was too late to go down to the rue saint jacques
he said never mind and ate a bit of bread
he did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with
chapter v divrs claps of thunder fall on maam bougon
on the following day maam bougon as courfeyrac styled the old
portress principal tenant housekeeper of the gorbeau hovel maam
bougon whose name was in reality madame burgon as we have found
out but this iconoclast courfeyrac respected nothing maam bougon
observed with stupefaction that m marius was going out again in his
he went to the luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his
bench midway of the alley he seated himself there as on the preceding
day surveying from a distance and clearly making out the white
bonnet the black dress and above all that blue light he did not stir
from it and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg closed he
did not see m leblanc and his daughter retire he concluded that they
had quitted the garden by the gate on the rue de louest later on
several weeks afterwards when he came to think it over he could never
on the following day which was the third maam bougon was
thunderstruck marius went out in his new coat three days in
she tried to follow him but marius walked briskly and with immense
strides it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois
she lost sight of him in two minutes and returned breathless
three quarters choked with asthma and furious if there is any sense
she growled in putting on ones best clothes every day and making
the young girl was there with m leblanc marius approached as near as
he could pretending to be busy reading a book but he halted afar off
then returned and seated himself on his bench where he spent four hours
in watching the house sparrows who were skipping about the walk and who
produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him
a fortnight passed thus marius went to the luxembourg no longer for the
sake of strolling there but to seat himself always in the same spot
and that without knowing why once arrived there he did not stir
he put on his new coat every morning for the purpose of not showing
himself and he began all over again on the morrow
she was decidedly a marvellous beauty the only remark approaching a
criticism that could be made was that the contradiction between
her gaze which was melancholy and her smile which was merry gave
a rather wild effect to her face which sometimes caused this sweet
countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming
on one of the last days of the second week marius was seated on his
bench as usual holding in his hand an open book of which he had not
turned a page for the last two hours all at once he started an event
was taking place at the other extremity of the walk leblanc and his
daughter had just left their seat and the daughter had taken her
fathers arm and both were advancing slowly towards the middle of the
alley where marius was marius closed his book then opened it again
then forced himself to read he trembled the aureole was coming
straight towards him ah good heavens thought he i shall not have
time to strike an attitude still the white haired man and the girl
advanced it seemed to him that this lasted for a century and that it
was but a second what are they coming in this direction for he asked
himself what she will pass here her feet will tread this sand this
walk two paces from me he was utterly upset he would have liked to
be very handsome he would have liked to own the cross he heard the
soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps he imagined that
m leblanc was darting angry glances at him is that gentleman going to
address me he thought to himself he dropped his head when he raised
it again they were very near him the young girl passed and as she
passed she glanced at him she gazed steadily at him with a pensive
sweetness which thrilled marius from head to foot it seemed to him
that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse
without coming as far as her and that she was saying to him i am
coming myself marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and
he felt his brain on fire she had come to him what joy and then how
she had looked at him she appeared to him more beautiful than he had
ever seen her yet beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and
angelic with a complete beauty which would have made petrarch sing and
dante kneel it seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure
heavens at the same time he was horribly vexed because there was dust
he thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too
he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared then he started
up and walked about the luxembourg garden like a madman it is possible
that at times he laughed to himself and talked aloud he was so dreamy
when he came near the childrens nurses that each one of them thought
he quitted the luxembourg hoping to find her again in the street
he encountered courfeyrac under the arcades of the odeon and said to
him come and dine with me they went off to rousseaus and spent
six francs marius ate like an ogre he gave the waiter six sous at
dessert he said to courfeyrac have you read the paper what a fine
after dinner he said to courfeyrac i will treat you to the play
they went to the porte sainte martin to see frederick in lauberge des
at the same time he had a redoubled attack of shyness on emerging
from the theatre he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was
stepping across a gutter and courfeyrac who said i should like to
put that woman in my collection almost horrified him
courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the cafe voltaire on the
following morning marius went thither and ate even more than on the
preceding evening he was very thoughtful and very merry one would
have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh
uproariously he tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces
who was presented to him a circle of students formed round the table
and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the state which was uttered
from the rostrum in the sorbonne then the conversation fell upon the
faults and omissions in guicherats dictionaries and grammars marius
interrupted the discussion to exclaim but it is very agreeable all
it was serious in fact marius had reached that first violent and
when the mine is charged when the conflagration is ready nothing is
it was all over with him marius loved a woman his fate was entering
the glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels which are
tranquil in appearance yet formidable you pass close to them every
day peaceably and with impunity and without a suspicion of anything a
moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there you go and come
dream speak laugh all at once you feel yourself clutched all is
over the wheels hold you fast the glance has ensnared you it has
caught you no matter where or how by some portion of your thought
which was fluttering loose by some distraction which had attacked you
you are lost the whole of you passes into it a chain of mysterious
forces takes possession of you you struggle in vain no more human
succor is possible you go on falling from gearing to gearing from
agony to agony from torture to torture you your mind your fortune
your future your soul and according to whether you are in the power
of a wicked creature or of a noble heart you will not escape from this
terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame or transfigured

isolation detachment from everything pride independence the taste
of nature the absence of daily and material activity the life within
himself the secret conflicts of chastity a benevolent ecstasy towards
all creation had prepared marius for this possession which is called
passion his worship of his father had gradually become a religion
and like all religions it had retreated to the depths of his soul
something was required in the foreground love came
a full month elapsed during which marius went every day to the
luxembourg when the hour arrived nothing could hold him back he
is on duty said courfeyrac marius lived in a state of delight it is
certain that the young girl did look at him
he had finally grown bold and approached the bench still he did not
pass in front of it any more in obedience to the instinct of timidity
and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers he considered it
better not to attract the attention of the father he combined his
stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a
profound diplomacy so that he might be seen as much as possible by the
young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman sometimes he
remained motionless by the half hour together in the shade of a leonidas
or a spartacus holding in his hand a book above which his eyes gently
raised sought the beautiful girl and she on her side turned her
charming profile towards him with a vague smile while conversing in the
most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white haired man
she bent upon marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye
ancient and time honored manoeuvre which eve understood from the very
first day of the world and which every woman understands from the very
first day of her life her mouth replied to one and her glance replied
it must be supposed that m leblanc finally noticed something for
often when marius arrived he rose and began to walk about he had
abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the
gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object
of seeing whether marius would pursue them thither marius did not
understand and committed this error the father began to grow
inexact and no longer brought his daughter every day sometimes he
came alone then marius did not stay another blunder
marius paid no heed to these symptoms from the phase of timidity he
had passed by a natural and fatal progress to the phase of blindness
his love increased he dreamed of it every night and then an
unexpected bliss had happened to him oil on the fire a redoubling of
the shadows over his eyes one evening at dusk he had found on
the bench which m leblanc and his daughter had just quitted a
handkerchief a very simple handkerchief without embroidery but white
and fine and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume he seized
it with rapture this handkerchief was marked with the letters u f
marius knew nothing about this beautiful child neither her family
name her christian name nor her abode these two letters were the first
thing of her that he had gained possession of adorable initials upon
which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding u was evidently
the christian name ursule he thought what a delicious name he
kissed the handkerchief drank it in placed it on his heart on his
flesh during the day and at night laid it beneath his lips that he
i feel that her whole soul lies within it he exclaimed
this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it
in the days which followed the finding of this treasure he only
displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the
handkerchief and laying it on his heart the beautiful child understood
nothing of all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs
chapter viii the veterans themselves can be happy
since we have pronounced the word modesty and since we conceal nothing
we ought to say that once nevertheless in spite of his ecstasies his
ursule caused him very serious grief it was on one of the days when
she persuaded m leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk
a brisk may breeze was blowing which swayed the crests of the
plaintain trees the father and daughter arm in arm had just passed
marius bench marius had risen to his feet behind them and was
following them with his eyes as was fitting in the desperate situation
all at once a gust of wind more merry than the rest and probably
charged with performing the affairs of springtime swept down from
the nursery flung itself on the alley enveloped the young girl in
a delicious shiver worthy of virgils nymphs and the fawns of
theocritus and lifted her dress the robe more sacred than that of
isis almost to the height of her garter a leg of exquisite shape
appeared marius saw it he was exasperated and furious
the young girl had hastily thrust down her dress with a divinely
troubled motion but he was none the less angry for all that he was
alone in the alley it is true but there might have been some one
there and what if there had been some one there can any one comprehend
such a thing what she had just done is horrible alas the poor child
had done nothing there had been but one culprit the wind but marius
in whom quivered the bartholo who exists in cherubin was determined to
be vexed and was jealous of his own shadow it is thus in fact that
the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human
heart and takes possession of it even without any right moreover
setting aside even that jealousy the sight of that charming leg had
contained nothing agreeable for him the white stocking of the first
woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure
when his ursule after having reached the end of the walk retraced
her steps with m leblanc and passed in front of the bench on which
marius had seated himself once more marius darted a sullen and
ferocious glance at her the young girl gave way to that slight
straightening up with a backward movement accompanied by a raising of
the eyelids which signifies well what is the matter
marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes when some one
crossed the walk it was a veteran very much bent extremely wrinkled
and pale in a uniform of the louis xv pattern bearing on his breast
the little oval plaque of red cloth with the crossed swords the
soldiers cross of saint louis and adorned in addition with a
coat sleeve which had no arm within it with a silver chin and a wooden
leg marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well
satisfied air it even struck him that the aged cynic as he hobbled
along past him addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink
as though some chance had created an understanding between them and as
though they had shared some piece of good luck together what did that
relic of mars mean by being so contented what had passed between
that wooden leg and the other marius reached a paroxysm of
jealousy perhaps he was there he said to himself perhaps he
saw and he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran
with the aid of time all points grow dull marius wrath against
ursule just and legitimate as it was passed off he finally pardoned
her but this cost him a great effort he sulked for three days
nevertheless in spite of all this and because of all this his passion
the reader has just seen how marius discovered or thought that he
appetite grows with loving to know that her name was ursule was a great
deal it was very little in three or four weeks marius had devoured
this bliss he wanted another he wanted to know where she lived
he had committed his first blunder by falling into the ambush of the
bench by the gladiator he had committed a second by not remaining at
the luxembourg when m leblanc came thither alone he now committed a
third and an immense one he followed ursule
she lived in the rue de louest in the most unfrequented spot in a
from that moment forth marius added to his happiness of seeing her at
the luxembourg the happiness of following her home
his hunger was increasing he knew her first name at least a charming
name a genuine womans name he knew where she lived he wanted to know
one evening after he had followed them to their dwelling and had seen
them disappear through the carriage gate he entered in their train and
is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor who has just come
no replied the porter he is the gentleman on the third floor
parbleu said the porter the house is only built on the street
and what is that gentlemans business began marius again
he is a gentleman of property sir a very kind man who does good to
marius went off quite abashed but delighted he was getting on
good thought he i know that her name is ursule that she is the
daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income and that she lives
there on the third floor in the rue de louest
on the following day m leblanc and his daughter made only a very
brief stay in the luxembourg they went away while it was still broad
daylight marius followed them to the rue de louest as he had taken up
the habit of doing on arriving at the carriage entrance m leblanc made
his daughter pass in first then paused before crossing the threshold
on the next day they did not come to the luxembourg marius waited for
at nightfall he went to the rue de louest and saw a light in the
he walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished
the next day no one at the luxembourg marius waited all day then went
and did sentinel duty under their windows this carried him on to ten
his dinner took care of itself fever nourishes the sick man and love
he spent a week in this manner m leblanc no longer appeared at the
