come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff
dolokhov smiled dont trouble if i want anything i wont beg ill
its a long long way to my native land
zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot
to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past
the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song
on returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general into his
private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating
to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that
had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced
army prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the required
papers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were
sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out
ah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he
was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in
all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression
and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken
word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his
own voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on my
personal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have
been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and
believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to
hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better
informed and more skillful general of whom austria has so many and to
lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes
and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at
liberty not to believe me and i dont even care whether you do or not
but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point
the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply
on the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your
excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by his
majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently
but that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which
his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the
austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general
mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian
defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
that were afloat and so kutuzovs suggestion of an austrian victory
sounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the
same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so
and in fact the last letter he had received from macks army informed
him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was
give me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew please
have a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners
of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage in
we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also as
we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not cross
the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line of
communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his
intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial
russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves
kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the
worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with
jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the
excuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to prince
andrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all the reports
from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one
from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said
handing him several papers make a neat memorandum in french out of all
this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian
army and then give it to his excellency
prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked
to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stepped
softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room
though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia he
had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his face
in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former
affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time to
think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with
agreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfaction
with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter
kutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly
promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants
and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions
from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade prince andrews father
your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry
firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a
on kutuzovs staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally
prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quite
opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be different
from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him
listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew
was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and
considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these people
prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
coming out of kutuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers in
his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aide de camp on duty
kozlovski who was sitting at the window with a book
i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come
probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door
but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the
order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head
who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door
commander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general speaking
quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancing
the commander in chief is engaged said kozlovski going hurriedly up
to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door whom shall i
the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who was
rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him
the commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmly
the generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took out
a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leaf
gave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himself
into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why do they
look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he
intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference
began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately broke
off the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the
doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though
running away from some danger and making long quick strides with his
vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice
kutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully
closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed
the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten
and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
orders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto been
inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy
prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the
details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost
understood all the difficulties of the russian armys position and
vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play
involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks time he might
perhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with the
french since suvorov met them he feared that bonapartes genius might
outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same time
could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced
excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his
room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridor
he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkov they
why are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince andrews pale
theres nothing to be gay about answered bolkonski
just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward them
from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who on
kutuzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army and
the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening
there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the
three officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside with
theyre coming theyre coming stand aside make way please
the generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid
embarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly
appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress
your excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressing
the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate you
he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson
the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the
seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a moments
attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening
i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite
well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a
the general frowned turned away and went on
gott wie naiv  said he angrily after he had gone a few steps
nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew but
bolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and
turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the
russian army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jest
if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply
with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i cant prevent your doing
so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence i
nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed
whats the matter i only congratulated them said zherkov
i am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkonski and
taking nesvitskis arm he left zherkov who did not know what to say
come whats the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying to soothe
whats the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his
excitement dont you understand that either we are officers serving
our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the
misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who care
nothing for their masters business quarante mille hommes massacres et
larmee de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire 
he said as if strengthening his views by this french sentence cest
bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un
ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous 2 only a hobbledehoy could
amuse himself in this way he added in russian but pronouncing the
word with a french accent having noticed that zherkov could still hear
 forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed
and you find that a cause for jesting
 2 it is all very well for that good for nothing fellow of whom you
have made a friend but not for you not for you
he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned
the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the
squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the
german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were
assigned to cavalry captain denisov the squadron commander known
throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov cadet rostov
ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with the
on october 11 the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
of macks defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
proceeding as usual denisov who had been losing at cards all night
had not yet come home when rostov rode back early in the morning from a
foraging expedition rostov in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his
horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly
ah bondarenko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up
headlong to the horse walk him up and down my dear fellow he
continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
people show to everyone when they are happy
yes your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his head
another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondarenko had already
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horses head it was
evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
serve him rostov patted the horses neck and then his flank and
splendid what a horse he will be he thought with a smile and
holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the
porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in
hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face
immediately brightened on seeing rostov schon gut morgen schon gut
morgen  he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to
 a very good morning a very good morning
schon fleissig  said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which
did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen kaiser
alexander hoch 2 said he quoting words often repeated by the
 2 hurrah for the austrians hurrah for the russians hurrah for
the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and
rostov waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing
und vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his
cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and
brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection
and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostov going
what about your master he asked lavrushka denisovs orderly whom
hasnt been in since the evening must have been losing answered
lavrushka i know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about
it but if he stays out till morning it means hes lost and will come
back in a rage will you have coffee
ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee hes coming said he
now for trouble rostov looked out of the window and saw denisov
coming home denisov was a small man with a red face sparkling black
eyes and black tousled mustache and hair he wore an unfastened cloak
wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled shako on the back
of his head he came up to the porch gloomily hanging his head
lavwuska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead
well i am taking it off replied lavrushkas voice
ah youre up already said denisov entering the room
long ago answered rostov i have already been for the hay and have
weally and ive been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a damned
fool cried denisov not pronouncing his rs such ill luck such ill
luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo there tea
puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong
teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed the
rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands
just fancy he didnt let me win a single cahd not one cahd
he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his
fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he
he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it
he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away
then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully
if at least we had some women here but theres nothing foh one to do
but dwink if we could only get to fighting soon hullo whos there
he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the
clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful cough
wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it
wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the
purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster
rostov took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins
ah telyanin how dye do they plucked me last night came denisovs
where at bykovs at the rats i knew it replied a piping voice
and lieutenant telyanin a small officer of the same squadron entered
rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
which was offered him telyanin for some reason had been transferred
from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well in the
regiment but was not liked rostov especially detested him and was
unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man
well young cavalryman how is my rook behaving he asked rook was a
the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another
i saw you riding this morning he added
oh hes all right a good horse answered rostov though the horse
for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum
hes begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he added
the hoofs cracked thats nothing ill teach you what to do and show
ill show you ill show you its not a secret and its a horse
then ill have it brought round said rostov wishing to avoid
telyanin and he went out to give the order
in the passage denisov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold
facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him on seeing rostov
denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting he frowned and gave a
ugh i dont like that fellow he said regardless of the
rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i but whats
one to do and having given his order he returned to telyanin
telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had left
well there certainly are disgusting people thought rostov as he
have you told them to bring the horse asked telyanin getting up and
let us go ourselves i only came round to ask denisov about yesterdays
not yet but where are you off to
i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said telyanin
they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant
explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters
when rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
table denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
paper he looked gloomily in rostovs face and said i am witing to
he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and
evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
write told rostov the contents of his letter
you see my fwiend he said we sleep when we dont love we are
childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god one is
pua as on the first day of cweation whos that now send him to the
devil im busy he shouted to lavrushka who went up to him not in the
who should it be you yourself told him to come its the quartermaster
denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped
wetched business he muttered to himself how much is left in the
oh its wetched well what are you standing there for you scacwow
please denisov let me lend you some i have some you know said
dont like bowwowing from my own fellows i dont growled denisov
but if you wont accept money from me like a comrade you will offend
and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow
denisov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there
wait havent you dropped it said rostov picking up the pillows one
he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there
dear me can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept it
under your head like a treasure said rostov i put it just here
where is it he asked turning to lavrushka
i havent been in the room it must be where you put it
youre always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it
no if i hadnt thought of it being a treasure said rostov but i
lavrushka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under
the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the
room denisov silently watched lavrushkas movements and when the
latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
rostov felt denisovs gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly
dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere
below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not draw breath
and there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
yourselves it must be here somewhere said lavrushka
now then you devils puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted
denisov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with a
threatening gesture if the purse isnt found ill flog you ill flog
rostov his eyes avoiding denisov began buttoning his coat buckled on
i must have that purse i tell you shouted denisov shaking his
orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall
denisov let him alone i know who has taken it said rostov going
toward the door without raising his eyes denisov paused thought a
moment and evidently understanding what rostov hinted at seized his
nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out
like cords you are mad i tell you i wont allow it the purse is
here ill flay this scoundwel alive and it will be found
i know who has taken it repeated rostov in an unsteady voice and
and i tell you dont you dahe to do it shouted denisov rushing at
but rostov pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though denisov
were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face
do you understand what youre saying he said in a trembling voice
there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it is not
he could not finish and ran out of the room
ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words rostov
the master is not in hes gone to headquarters said telyanins
orderly has something happened he added surprised at the cadets
youve only just missed him said the orderly
the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck and
rostov without returning home took a horse and rode there there was
an inn in the village which the officers frequented rostov rode up to
it and saw telyanins horse at the porch
in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
ah youve come here too young man he said smiling and raising his
yes said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and
both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in the
room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turned up
fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
the coin was a new one rostov rose and went up to telyanin
allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost inaudible
with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised telyanin handed him the
yes its a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and
rostov took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and
looked at telyanin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
if we get to vienna ill get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns theres nowhere to spend it said he well let me have
and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite decently
here continued telyanin now then let me have it
he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov let go of
it telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
slightly open as if to say yes yes i am putting my purse in my
pocket and thats quite simple and is no one elses business
well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows
some flash as of an electric spark shot from telyanins eyes to rostovs
and back and back again and again in an instant
come here said rostov catching hold of telyanins arm and almost
dragging him to the window that money is denisovs you took it he
what what how dare you what said telyanin
but these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for
pardon as soon as rostov heard them an enormous load of doubt fell
from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity the
miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be
heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered telyanin
taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we must have an
i know it and shall prove it said rostov
every muscle of telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
to rostovs face and his sobs were audible
count dont ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money
take it he threw it on the table i have an old father and
rostov took the money avoiding telyanins eyes and went out of the
room without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his
steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you do it
dont touch me said rostov drawing back if you need it take the
money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn
that same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadrons
and i tell you rostov that you must apologize to the colonel said a
tall grizzly haired staff captain with enormous mustaches and many
wrinkles on his large features to rostov who was crimson with
the staff captain kirsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for
affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission
i will allow no one to call me a liar cried rostov he told me i
lied and i told him he lied and there it rests he may keep me on duty
every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make me
apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then
you just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted the
staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache you
tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has
im not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other
officers perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am not a
diplomatist thats why i joined the hussars thinking that here one
would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lying so let him give
thats all right no one thinks you a coward but thats not the point
ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand
denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it he answered the
staff captains question by a disapproving shake of his head
you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
officers continued the staff captain and bogdanich the colonel was
he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth
well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
i did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and
severely you dont wish to apologize but man its not only to him
but to the whole regiment all of us youre to blame all round the
case is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken
advice but no you go and blurt it all straight out before the
officers now what was the colonel to do have the officer tried and
disgrace the whole regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one
scoundrel is that how you look at it we dont see it like that and
bogdanich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true
its not pleasant but whats to be done my dear fellow you landed
yourself in it and now when one wants to smooth the thing over some
conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish to make the whole affair
public you are offended at being put on duty a bit but why not
apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever bogdanich may be
anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel youre quick at taking
offense but you dont mind disgracing the whole regiment the staff
captains voice began to tremble you have been in the regiment next to
no time my lad youre here today and tomorrow youll be appointed
adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said there are
thieves among the pavlograd officers but its not all the same to us
am i not right denisov its not the same
denisov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with
you value your own pride and dont wish to apologize continued the
staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and god
willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the
regiment and bogdanich knows it oh we do prize it old fellow and
all this is not right its not right you may take offense or not but i
always stick to mother truth its not right
and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostov
thats twue devil take it shouted denisov jumping up now then
rostov growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer
no gentlemen no you mustnt think i quite understand youre
wrong to think that of me i for me for the honor of the
regiment id ah well ill show that in action and for me the honor
of the flag well never mind its true im to blame to blame all
come thats right count cried the staff captain turning round and
clapping rostov on the shoulder with his big hand
i tell you shouted denisov hes a fine fellow
thats better count said the staff captain beginning to address
rostov by his title as if in recognition of his confession go and
gentlemen ill do anything no one shall hear a word from me said
rostov in an imploring voice but i cant apologize by god i cant do
what you will how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking
itll be worse for you bogdanich is vindictive and youll pay for your
no on my word its not obstinacy i cant describe the feeling i
well its as you like said the staff captain and what has become
he has weported himself sick hes to be stwuck off the list tomowwow
it is an illness theres no other way of explaining it said the
illness or not hed better not cwoss my path id kill him shouted
what brings you here cried the officers turning to the newcomer
were to go into action gentlemen mack has surrendered with his whole
what saw the real mack with hands and feet
into action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how did
ive been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil mack
an austrian general complained of me i congratulated him on macks
arrival whats the matter rostov you look as if youd just come out
oh my dear fellow were in such a stew here these last two days
the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
zherkov they were under orders to advance next day
well thank god weve been sitting here too long
kutuzov fell back toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges over
the rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october 23 the
russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russian
baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling
through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge
it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out
before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the
bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and
then suddenly spread out in the sunlight far distant objects could be
clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below the
little town could be seen with its white red roofed houses its
cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
the enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the
danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green
treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns the
among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through
his fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to the
rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of a gun
carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a
flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real
doppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their
knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass
yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool its a fine
place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski was
thank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased to
be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovely place

look prince said another who would have dearly liked to take
another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the
countryside see our infantrymen have already got there look there in
the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something
theyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval
so they will said nesvitski no but what i should like added he
munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth would be to slip in
he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and
just to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls among
them on my word id give five years of my life for it
they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers
meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to

glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is theyll be fired on at the
on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from
their battery a milk white cloud arose then came the distant report of
a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing
nesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling
would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said
