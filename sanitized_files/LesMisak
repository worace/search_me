this resumed with an air of perfect indifference
it is lucky that you recognize the fact
i am forced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found
the sheet of paper which m madeleine was holding dropped from his
hand he raised his head gazed fixedly at javert and said with his
this is the way it is mr mayor it seems that there was in the
neighborhood near ailly le haut clocher an old fellow who was called
father champmathieu he was a very wretched creature no one paid any
attention to him no one knows what such people subsist on lately last
autumn father champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider
apples from well no matter a theft had been committed a wall scaled
branches of trees broken my champmathieu was arrested he still had
the branch of apple tree in his hand the scamp is locked up up to
this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor but here is where
the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate finds it
convenient to transfer champmathieu to arras where the departmental
prison is situated in this prison at arras there is an ex convict named
brevet who is detained for i know not what and who has been appointed
turnkey of the house because of good behavior mr mayor no sooner had
champmathieu arrived than brevet exclaims eh why i know that man
he is a fagot4 take a good look at me my good man you are jean
valjean jean valjean whos jean valjean champmathieu feigns
astonishment dont play the innocent dodge says brevet you are
jean valjean you have been in the galleys of toulon it was twenty
years ago we were there together champmathieu denies it parbleu you
understand the case is investigated the thing was well ventilated for
me this is what they discovered this champmathieu had been thirty
years ago a pruner of trees in various localities notably at
faverolles there all trace of him was lost a long time afterwards he
was seen again in auvergne then in paris where he is said to have been
a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that
has not been proved now before going to the galleys for theft what
was jean valjean a pruner of trees where at faverolles another fact
this valjeans christian name was jean and his mothers surname was
mathieu what more natural to suppose than that on emerging from the
galleys he should have taken his mothers name for the purpose of
concealing himself and have called himself jean mathieu he goes to
auvergne the local pronunciation turns jean into chan he is called
chan mathieu our man offers no opposition and behold him transformed
into champmathieu you follow me do you not inquiries were made at
faverolles the family of jean valjean is no longer there it is not
known where they have gone you know that among those classes a family
often disappears search was made and nothing was found when such
people are not mud they are dust and then as the beginning of the
story dates thirty years back there is no longer any one at faverolles
who knew jean valjean inquiries were made at toulon besides brevet
there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean
they are cochepaille and chenildieu and are sentenced for life
they are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended
champmathieu they do not hesitate he is jean valjean for them as well
as for brevet the same age he is fifty four the same height the
same air the same man in short it is he it was precisely at this
moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris i
was told that i had lost my reason and that jean valjean is at arras
in the power of the authorities you can imagine whether this surprised
me when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here i write to
the examining judge he sends for me champmathieu is conducted to me 
javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy as ever
mr mayor the truth is the truth i am sorry but that man is jean
m madeleine resumed in a very low voice
javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from
he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanically taking pinches of
powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the
and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean i do not see how i
could have thought otherwise i beg your pardon mr mayor
javert as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man
who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole
station house and bade him leave the room javert that haughty man
was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity m madeleine made no
other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question
ah indeed mr mayor its a bad business if he is jean valjean he
has his previous conviction against him to climb a wall to break a
branch to purloin apples is a mischievous trick in a child for a
man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime robbing
and housebreaking it is all there it is no longer a question of
correctional police it is a matter for the court of assizes it is no
longer a matter of a few days in prison it is the galleys for life and
then there is the affair with the little savoyard who will return i
hope the deuce there is plenty to dispute in the matter is there not
yes for any one but jean valjean but jean valjean is a sly dog that
is the way i recognized him any other man would have felt that things
were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry out the
kettle sings before the fire he would not be jean valjean et
cetera but he has not the appearance of understanding he says i am
champmathieu and i wont depart from that he has an astonished air
he pretends to be stupid it is far better oh the rogue is clever but
it makes no difference the proofs are there he has been recognized by
four persons the old scamp will be condemned the case has been taken
to the assizes at arras i shall go there to give my testimony i have
m madeleine had turned to his desk again and taken up his docket and
was turning over the leaves tranquilly reading and writing by turns
like a busy man he turned to javert
that will do javert in truth all these details interest me but
little we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand
javert you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman
buseaupied who sells herbs at the corner of the rue saint saulve you
will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre
chesnelong the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and
her child he must be punished you will then go to m charcellay
rue montre de champigny he complained that there is a gutter on the
adjoining house which discharges rain water on his premises and is
undermining the foundations of his house after that you will verify
the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in
the rue guibourg at widow doriss and rue du garraud blanc at madame
renee le bosses and you will prepare documents but i am giving you a
great deal of work are you not to be absent did you not tell me that
you were going to arras on that matter in a week or ten days
why i thought that i had said to monsieur le maire that the case was
to be tried to morrow and that i am to set out by diligence to night
one day at the most the judgment will be pronounced to morrow evening
at latest but i shall not wait for the sentence which is certain i
shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken
and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand
mr mayor there is still something of which i must remind you
javert you are a man of honor and i esteem you you exaggerate your
fault moreover this is an offence which concerns me javert you
deserve promotion instead of degradation i wish you to retain your
javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depths his
not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible and
i repeat replied m madeleine that the matter concerns me
but javert heeding his own thought only continued
so far as exaggeration is concerned i am not exaggerating this is the
way i reason i have suspected you unjustly that is nothing it is our
right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves
is an abuse but without proofs in a fit of rage with the object
of wreaking my vengeance i have denounced you as a convict you a
respectable man a mayor a magistrate that is serious very serious i
have insulted authority in your person i an agent of the authorities
if one of my subordinates had done what i have done i should have
declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him well stop
mr mayor one word more i have often been severe in the course of my
life towards others that is just i have done well now if i were not
severe towards myself all the justice that i have done would become
injustice ought i to spare myself more than others no what i should
be good for nothing but to chastise others and not myself why i
should be a blackguard those who say that blackguard of a javert
would be in the right mr mayor i do not desire that you should treat
me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was
directed to others i want none of it for myself the kindness which
consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police
agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is
up in the world is what i call false kindness that is the sort of
kindness which disorganizes society good god it is very easy to be
kind the difficulty lies in being just come if you had been what i
thought you i should not have been kind to you not i you would have
seen mr mayor i must treat myself as i would treat any other man
when i have subdued malefactors when i have proceeded with vigor
against rascals i have often said to myself if you flinch if i ever
catch you in fault you may rest at your ease i have flinched i
have caught myself in a fault so much the worse come discharged
cashiered expelled that is well i have arms i will till the soil it
makes no difference to me mr mayor the good of the service demands an
example i simply require the discharge of inspector javert
all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced tone
which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man
javert recoiled and said in a wild voice
excuse me mr mayor but this must not be a mayor does not offer his
a police spy yes from the moment when i have misused the police i am
then he bowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door
there he wheeled round and with eyes still downcast
mr mayor he said i shall continue to serve until i am superseded
he withdrew m madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm
sure step which died away on the pavement of the corridor
the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at m sur
m but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory
in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did
not narrate them in their most minute details among these details the
reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we
on the afternoon following the visit of javert m madeleine went to see
before entering fantines room he had sister simplice summoned
the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary
lazariste ladies like all sisters of charity bore the names of sister
sister perpetue was an ordinary villager a sister of charity in a
coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters any other
service she was a nun as other women are cooks this type is not
so very rare the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant
earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline
these rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion the
transition from a drover to a carmelite is not in the least violent
the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance
common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand
and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk a little
more amplitude in the smock and it becomes a frock sister perpetue
was a robust nun from marines near pontoise who chattered her patois
droned grumbled sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the
hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was
crabbed with the dying almost flung god in their faces stoned their
death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage was bold honest and ruddy
sister simplice was white with a waxen pallor beside sister perpetue
she was the taper beside the candle vincent de paul has divinely traced
the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words in which
he mingles as much freedom as servitude they shall have for their
convent only the house of the sick for cell only a hired room for
chapel only their parish church for cloister only the streets of the
town and the wards of the hospitals for enclosure only obedience for
gratings only the fear of god for veil only modesty this ideal was
realized in the living person of sister simplice she had never been
young and it seemed as though she would never grow old no one could
have told sister simplices age she was a person we dare not say a
woman who was gentle austere well bred cold and who had never lied
she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than
granite she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure
and fine there was so to speak silence in her speech she said just
what was necessary and she possessed a tone of voice which would
have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing room this
delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown finding in this harsh
contact a continual reminder of heaven and of god let us emphasize
one detail never to have lied never to have said for any interest
whatever even in indifference any single thing which was not the
truth the sacred truth was sister simplices distinctive trait it was
the accent of her virtue she was almost renowned in the congregation
for this imperturbable veracity the abbe sicard speaks of sister
simplice in a letter to the deaf mute massieu however pure and sincere
we may be we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little innocent
lie she did not little lie innocent lie does such a thing exist to
lie is the absolute form of evil to lie a little is not possible he
who lies lies the whole lie to lie is the very face of the demon
satan has two names he is called satan and lying that is what she
thought and as she thought so she did the result was the whiteness
which we have mentioned a whiteness which covered even her lips and her
eyes with radiance her smile was white her glance was white there was
not a single spiders web not a grain of dust on the glass window of
that conscience on entering the order of saint vincent de paul she had
taken the name of simplice by special choice simplice of sicily as we
know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn
off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had
been born at syracuse a lie which would have saved her this patron
sister simplice on her entrance into the order had had two faults
which she had gradually corrected she had a taste for dainties and she
liked to receive letters she never read anything but a book of prayers
printed in latin in coarse type she did not understand latin but she
this pious woman had conceived an affection for fantine probably
feeling a latent virtue there and she had devoted herself almost
m madeleine took sister simplice apart and recommended fantine to her
in a singular tone which the sister recalled later on
fantine awaited m madeleines appearance every day as one awaits a ray
of warmth and joy she said to the sisters i only live when monsieur
she had a great deal of fever that day as soon as she saw m madeleine
m madeleine was the same as usual with fantine only he remained an
hour instead of half an hour to fantines great delight he urged every
one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything it was
noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre
but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent
down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground fast
then he returned to the town hall and the clerk observed him
attentively examining a road map of france which hung in his study he
wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil
from the town hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town to a
fleming named master scaufflaer french scaufflaire who let out horses
in order to reach this scaufflaire the shortest way was to take the
little frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the
parish in which m madeleine resided the cure was it was said a
worthy respectable and sensible man at the moment when m madeleine
arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer by in the
street and this person noticed this after the mayor had passed the
priests house he halted stood motionless then turned about and
retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage which had an iron
knocker he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then
he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after
the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall
abruptly he placed it gently and resumed his way with a sort of haste
m madeleine found master scaufflaire at home engaged in stitching a
master scaufflaire he inquired have you a good horse
mr mayor said the fleming all my horses are good what do you mean
i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day
and how long can he rest at the end of his journey
he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary
the deuce the deuce and it is twenty leagues
m madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled
some figures he showed it to the fleming the figures were 5 6 8 12
you see he said total nineteen and a half as well say twenty
mr mayor returned the fleming i have just what you want my little
white horse you may have seen him pass occasionally he is a small
beast from lower boulonnais he is full of fire they wanted to make
a saddle horse of him at first bah he reared he kicked he laid
everybody flat on the ground he was thought to be vicious and no one
knew what to do with him i bought him i harnessed him to a carriage
that is what he wanted sir he is as gentle as a girl he goes like the
wind ah indeed he must not be mounted it does not suit his ideas to
be a saddle horse every one has his ambition draw yes carry no
we must suppose that is what he said to himself
your twenty leagues all at a full trot and in less than eight hours
in the first place you will give him half an hours breathing spell
midway of the road he will eat and some one must be by while he is
eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats for
i have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable
in the second place is the cabriolet for monsieur le maire
does monsieur le maire know how to drive
well monsieur le maire will travel alone and without baggage in order
but as monsieur le maire will have no one with him he will be obliged
to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen
i am to have thirty francs a day the days of rest to be paid for
also not a farthing less and the beasts food to be at monsieur le
m madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the
here is the pay for two days in advance
fourthly for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy and would
fatigue the horse monsieur le maire must consent to travel in a little
it is light but it has no cover
has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter
m madeleine did not reply the fleming resumed
the tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to morrow morning
of course monsieur le maire replied scaufflaire then scratching a
speck in the wood of the table with his thumb nail he resumed with that
careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with
but this is what i am thinking of now monsieur le maire has not told
me where he is going where is monsieur le maire going
he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the
conversation but he did not know why he had not dared to put the
are your horses forelegs good said m madeleine
yes monsieur le maire you must hold him in a little when going down
hill are there many descends between here and the place whither you are
do not forget to be at my door at precisely half past four oclock
to morrow morning replied m madeleine and he took his departure
the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said some time
the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again
he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air
monsieur scaufflaire said he at what sum do you estimate the value
of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me the one bearing
the one dragging the other monsieur le maire said the fleming with
does monsieur le maire wish to purchase them or me
no but i wish to guarantee you in any case you shall give me back
the sum at my return at what value do you estimate your horse and
m madeleine laid a bank bill on the table then left the room and this
master scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a
thousand francs besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a
the fleming called his wife and related the affair to her where the
devil could monsieur le maire be going they held counsel together
he is going to paris said the wife i dont believe it said the
m madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay
on the chimney piece the fleming picked it up and studied it five
six eight and a half that must designate the posting relays he
it is five leagues from here to hesdin six from hesdin to saint pol
eight and a half from saint pol to arras he is going to arras
meanwhile m madeleine had returned home he had taken the longest way
to return from master scaufflaires as though the parsonage door had
been a temptation for him and he had wished to avoid it he ascended
to his room and there he shut himself up which was a very simple act
since he liked to go to bed early nevertheless the portress of the
factory who was at the same time m madeleines only servant noticed
that the latters light was extinguished at half past eight and she
mentioned it to the cashier when he came home adding
is monsieur le maire ill i thought he had a rather singular air
this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m madeleines
chamber he paid no heed to the portresss words but went to bed and
to sleep towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had
heard a noise above his head he listened it was a footstep pacing back
and forth as though some one were walking in the room above him he
listened more attentively and recognized m madeleines step this
struck him as strange usually there was no noise in m madeleines
chamber until he rose in the morning a moment later the cashier heard
a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and then shut
again then a piece of furniture was disarranged then a pause ensued
then the step began again the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now
and staring and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of a
lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the
rays it could only come from the window of m madeleines chamber the
reflection wavered as though it came rather from a fire which had
been lighted than from a candle the shadow of the window frame was not
shown which indicated that the window was wide open the fact that this
window was open in such cold weather was surprising the cashier fell
asleep again an hour or two later he waked again the same step was
still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead
the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and
peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle the window was
this is what had taken place in m madeleines room
the reader has no doubt already divined that m madeleine is no other
we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has
now come when we must take another look into it we do so not without
emotion and trepidation there is nothing more terrible in existence
than this sort of contemplation the eye of the spirit can nowhere find
more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man it can fix itself
on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more
mysterious and more infinite there is a spectacle more grand than the
sea it is heaven there is a spectacle more grand than heaven it is
to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to
a single man were it only in connection with the basest of men would
be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic conscience
is the chaos of chimeras of lusts and of temptations the furnace of
dreams the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium
of sophisms it is the battlefield of the passions penetrate at
certain hours past the livid face of a human being who is engaged
in reflection and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that
obscurity there beneath that external silence battles of giants
like those recorded in homer are in progress skirmishes of dragons and
hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton visionary circles as in
dante what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within
him and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his
alighieri one day met with a sinister looking door before which he
hesitated here is one before us upon whose threshold we hesitate let
we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had
happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais from
that moment forth he was as we have seen a totally different man what
the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out it was more
he succeeded in disappearing sold the bishops silver reserving only
the candlesticks as a souvenir crept from town to town traversed
france came to m sur m conceived the idea which we have mentioned
accomplished what we have related succeeded in rendering himself safe
from seizure and inaccessible and thenceforth established at m sur
m happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first
half of his existence belied by the last he lived in peace reassured
and hopeful having henceforth only two thoughts to conceal his name
and to sanctify his life to escape men and to return to god
these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that
they formed but a single one there both were equally absorbing and
imperative and ruled his slightest actions in general they conspired
to regulate the conduct of his life they turned him towards the gloom
they rendered him kindly and simple they counselled him to the same
things sometimes however they conflicted in that case as the reader
will remember the man whom all the country of m sur m called m
madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second his
security to his virtue thus in spite of all his reserve and all his
prudence he had preserved the bishops candlesticks worn mourning for
him summoned and interrogated all the little savoyards who passed that
way collected information regarding the families at faverolles and
saved old fauchelevents life despite the disquieting insinuations of
javert it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought
following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just
that his first duty was not towards himself
at the same time it must be confessed nothing just like this had yet
never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings
we are narrating engaged in so serious a struggle he understood this
confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by javert
when the latter entered his study at the moment when that name which
he had buried beneath so many layers was so strangely articulated
he was struck with stupor and as though intoxicated with the sinister
eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupor he felt that
shudder which precedes great shocks he bent like an oak at the approach
of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault he felt
shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head
as he listened to javert the first thought which occurred to him was to
go to run and denounce himself to take that champmathieu out of prison
and place himself there this was as painful and as poignant as an
incision in the living flesh then it passed away and he said to
himself we will see we will see he repressed this first generous
it would be beautiful no doubt after the bishops holy words after
so many years of repentance and abnegation in the midst of a penitence
admirably begun if this man had not flinched for an instant even in
the presence of so terrible a conjecture but had continued to walk with
the same step towards this yawning precipice at the bottom of which
lay heaven that would have been beautiful but it was not thus we must
render an account of the things which went on in this soul and we can
only tell what there was there he was carried away at first by
the instinct of self preservation he rallied all his ideas in haste
stifled his emotions took into consideration javerts presence that
great danger postponed all decision with the firmness of terror shook
off thought as to what he had to do and resumed his calmness as a
he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind
within a profound tranquillity without he took no preservative
measures as they may be called everything was still confused and
jostling together in his brain his trouble was so great that he could
not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have
told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow
he repaired to fantines bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his
visit through a kindly instinct telling himself that he must behave
thus and recommend her well to the sisters in case he should be
obliged to be absent himself he had a vague feeling that he might be
obliged to go to arras and without having the least in the world made
up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was
beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the
way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the
tilbury from scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event
he dined with a good deal of appetite
on returning to his room he communed with himself
he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented
that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair moved by some
inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door he feared
lest something more should enter he was barricading himself against
a moment later he extinguished his light it embarrassed him
it seemed to him as though he might be seen
alas that on which he desired to close the door had already entered
that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his
nevertheless he deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security
and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable
the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible then he took
possession of himself he set his elbows on the table leaned his head
on his hand and began to meditate in the dark
where do i stand am not i dreaming what have i heard is it really
true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that
manner who can that champmathieu be so he resembles me is it
possible when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far
from suspecting anything what was i doing yesterday at this hour what
is there in this incident what will the end be what is to be done
this was the torment in which he found himself his brain had lost its
power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his
nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed
his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and
his head was burning he went to the window and threw it wide open
there were no stars in the sky he returned and seated himself at the
gradually however vague outlines began to take form and to fix
themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with
precision of the reality not the whole situation but some of
the details he began by recognizing the fact that critical and
extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it
this only caused an increase of his stupor
independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to
his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a
hole in which to bury his name that which he had always feared most of
all in his hours of self communion during his sleepless nights was to
ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would
be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made
its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about
him and who knows perhaps even his new soul within him also he
shuddered at the very thought that this was possible assuredly if any
one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that
name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would
suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that
formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had
enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that
that name would not menace him that that light would but produce
an obscurity more dense that this rent veil would but increase the
mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this
prodigious incident would have no other result so far as he was
concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his
existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his
confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy
citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and
more respected than ever if any one had told him that he would have
tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman well all
this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of
impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted these wild fancies to
his revery continued to grow clearer he came more and more to an
it seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable
dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle
of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very
brink of the abyss he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger
a man unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she
was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might
close once more it was necessary that some one himself or that other
man should fall into it he had only let things take their course
the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that
his place was empty in the galleys that do what he would it was still
awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it
that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled
it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself
that at this moment he had a substitute that it appeared that a
certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself
being present in the galleys in the person of that champmathieu present
in society under the name of m madeleine he had nothing more to fear
provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of
that champmathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the
all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place
in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two
or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the
conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which
is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an
well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is
there in all that for me to think about i am safe all is over i had
but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life
and behold that door is walled up forever that javert who has been
annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined
me which had divined me good god and which followed me everywhere
that frightful hunting dog always making a point at me is thrown
off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail
henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he has his jean
valjean who knows it is even probable that he will wish to leave town
and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count
for nothing in it ah but where is the misfortune in this upon my
honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened
to me after all if it does bring harm to some one that is not my
fault in the least it is providence which has done it all it is
because it wishes it so to be evidently have i the right to disarrange
what it has arranged what do i ask now why should i meddle it does
not concern me what i am not satisfied but what more do i want the
goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights
the object of my prayers to heaven security i have now attained it
is god who wills it i can do nothing against the will of god and why
does god will it in order that i may continue what i have begun that i
may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that
it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to
the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have
returned really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while
ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this
is evidently what he would have said to me it is settled let things
take their course let the good god do as he likes
thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending
over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began
to pace the room come said he let us think no more about it my
resolve is taken but he felt no joy
one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can
the sea from returning to the shore the sailor calls it the tide the
guilty man calls it remorse god upheaves the soul as he does the ocean
after the expiration of a few moments do what he would he resumed the
gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying
that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which
he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power
which said to him think as it said to another condemned man two
before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully
understood let us insist upon one necessary observation
it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living
being who has not done it it may even be said that the word is never
a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience
within a man and when it returns from conscience to thought it is in
this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter he
said he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to ones self talks
to ones self exclaims to ones self without breaking the external
silence there is a great tumult everything about us talks except the
mouth the realities of the soul are none the less realities because
so he asked himself where he stood he interrogated himself upon that
settled resolve he confessed to himself that all that he had just
arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their
course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to
allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it
to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short
was to do everything that this was hypocritical baseness in the last
degree that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime
for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the
bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
he continued to question himself he asked himself severely what he had
meant by this my object is attained he declared to himself that
his life really had an object but what object to conceal his name
to deceive the police was it for so petty a thing that he had done all
that he had done had he not another and a grand object which was the
true one to save not his person but his soul to become honest and
good once more to be a just man was it not that above all that alone
which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon him to
shut the door on his past but he was not shutting it great god he was
re opening it by committing an infamous action he was becoming a thief
once more and the most odious of thieves he was robbing another of
his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine he was
becoming an assassin he was murdering morally murdering a wretched
man he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death
beneath the open sky which is called the galleys on the other hand
to surrender himself to save that man struck down with so melancholy
an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the
convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection
and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged to fall back
there in appearance was to escape from it in reality this must be
done he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was
useless all his penitence was wasted there was no longer any need of
saying what is the use he felt that the bishop was there that the
bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop
was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his
virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean
would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but
that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop
beheld his conscience so he must go to arras deliver the false jean
valjean and denounce the real one alas that was the greatest of
sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but
it must be done sad fate he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes
of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men
well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us
save this man he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he
he took his books verified them and put them in order he flung in
the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed
tradesmen he wrote and sealed a letter and on the envelope it might
have been read had there been any one in his chamber at the moment
to monsieur laffitte banker rue dartois paris he drew from his
secretary a pocket book which contained several bank notes and the
passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the
any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts
into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion
of what was going on within him only occasionally did his lips move at
other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the
wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to
when he had finished the letter to m laffitte he put it into his
pocket together with the pocket book and began his walk once more
his revery had not swerved from its course he continued to see his duty
