well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the
buonapartes but i warn you if you dont tell me that this means war
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing more
to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful
slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened
you sit down and tell me all the news
it was in july 1805 and the speaker was the well known anna pavlovna
scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with
these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and
importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pavlovna
had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la
grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the
all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered
by a scarlet liveried footman that morning ran as follows
if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible
i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10 annette
heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least
disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an
embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on
his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that
refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and
with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna
kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head
first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friends mind
at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and
affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like
these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the
and the fete at the english ambassadors today is wednesday i must
put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for
i thought todays fete had been canceled i confess all these
if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been
put off said the prince who like a wound up clock by force of habit
said things he did not even wish to be believed
dont tease well and what has been decided about novosiltsevs
what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless
tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has
burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours
prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale
part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had
become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel
like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it
did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed
as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect
which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst
oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand things
but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is
betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one
thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will
not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just
one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders loftiness
of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and
still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did
novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot
understand the self abnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for
himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they
promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not
perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and
that all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe a word
that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian
neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty
destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe
she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity
i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent
instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of
prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a
in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting
two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is
connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best
french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and
also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been
i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he
added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be
appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor
prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were
trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the
anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was
baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister
was all she said in a dry and mournful tone
as she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke
beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness
the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and
courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished
both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she
now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out
everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly
the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude
i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to
the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and
social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i dont
speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him she added in a tone
admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming
children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you
i cant help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the
dont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am
dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face
assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her majestys
the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly
what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a
father could for their education and they have both turned out fools
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that
is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more
natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth
very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant
and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father
there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna
i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my
children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that
is how i explain it to myself it cant be helped
he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she
asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i
dont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who is
very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary
