circled round defarges wine shop and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat issued orders issued arms
thrust this man back dragged this man forward disarmed one to arm
another laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar
keep near to me jacques three cried defarge and do you jacques
one and two separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can where is my wife
eh well here you see me said madame composed as ever but not
knitting to day madames resolute right hand was occupied with an axe
in place of the usual softer implements and in her girdle were a pistol
i go said madame with you at present you shall see me at the head
come then cried defarge in a resounding voice patriots and
with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped
into the detested word the living sea rose wave on wave depth on
depth and overflowed the city to that point alarm bells ringing drums
beating the sea raging and thundering on its new beach the attack
deep ditches double drawbridge massive stone walls eight great
towers cannon muskets fire and smoke through the fire and through
the smoke in the fire and in the smoke for the sea cast him up against
a cannon and on the instant he became a cannonier defarge of the
wine shop worked like a manful soldier two fierce hours
deep ditch single drawbridge massive stone walls eight great towers
cannon muskets fire and smoke one drawbridge down work comrades
all work work jacques one jacques two jacques one thousand jacques
two thousand jacques five and twenty thousand in the name of all
the angels or the devils which you prefer work thus defarge of the
wine shop still at his gun which had long grown hot
to me women cried madame his wife what we can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken and to her with a shrill thirsty
cry trooping women variously armed but all armed alike in hunger and
cannon muskets fire and smoke but still the deep ditch the single
drawbridge the massive stone walls and the eight great towers slight
displacements of the raging sea made by the falling wounded flashing
weapons blazing torches smoking waggonloads of wet straw hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions shrieks volleys
execrations bravery without stint boom smash and rattle and the
furious sounding of the living sea but still the deep ditch and the
single drawbridge and the massive stone walls and the eight great
towers and still defarge of the wine shop at his gun grown doubly hot
a white flag from within the fortress and a parley this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm nothing audible in it suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher and swept defarge of the
wine shop over the lowered drawbridge past the massive stone outer
walls in among the eight great towers surrendered
so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the south sea until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the bastille there against an angle of a wall he
made a struggle to look about him jacques three was nearly at his side
madame defarge still heading some of her women was visible in the
inner distance and her knife was in her hand everywhere was tumult
exultation deafening and maniacal bewilderment astounding noise yet
of all these cries and ten thousand incoherences the prisoners was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in as if there were an
eternity of people as well as of time and space when the foremost
billows rolled past bearing the prison officers with them and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men a man with a grey head who had a lighted torch in his
hand separated him from the rest and got him between himself and the
show me the north tower said defarge quick
i will faithfully replied the man if you will come with me but
what is the meaning of one hundred and five north tower asked
does it mean a captive or a place of captivity or do you mean that i
kill him croaked jacques three who had come close up
jacques three with his usual craving on him and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed
held by defarges arm as he held by the turnkeys their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another even then so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean in its irruption into the fortress and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases all around
outside too it beat the walls with a deep hoarse roar from which
occasionally some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages down cavernous flights of steps
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick more like dry
waterfalls than staircases defarge the turnkey and jacques three
linked hand and arm went with all the speed they could make here and
there especially at first the inundation started on them and swept by
but when they had done descending and were winding and climbing up a
tower they were alone hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull subdued way as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing
the turnkey stopped at a low door put a key in a clashing lock swung
the door slowly open and said as they all bent their heads and passed
there was a small heavily grated unglazed window high in the wall
with a stone screen before it so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up there was a small chimney heavily barred
across a few feet within there was a heap of old feathery wood ashes
on the hearth there was a stool and table and a straw bed there were
the four blackened walls and a rusted iron ring in one of them
pass that torch slowly along these walls that i may see them said
the man obeyed and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes
a m croaked jacques three as he read greedily
alexandre manette said defarge in his ear following the letters
with his swart forefinger deeply engrained with gunpowder and here he
wrote a poor physician and it was he without doubt who scratched
a calendar on this stone what is that in your hand a crowbar give it
he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand he made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments and turning on the worm eaten stool and
table beat them to pieces in a few blows
hold the light higher he said wrathfully to the turnkey look
among those fragments with care jacques and see here is my knife
throwing it to him rip open that bed and search the straw hold the
with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth and
peering up the chimney struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar
and worked at the iron grating across it in a few minutes some mortar
and dust came dropping down which he averted his face to avoid and
in it and in the old wood ashes and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself he groped with a
nothing in the wood and nothing in the straw jacques
let us collect them together in the middle of the cell so light
the turnkey fired the little pile which blazed high and hot stooping
again to come out at the low arched door they left it burning and
retraced their way to the courtyard seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down until they were in the raging flood once
they found it surging and tossing in quest of defarge himself saint
antoine was clamorous to have its wine shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people
otherwise the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for
judgment otherwise the governor would escape and the peoples
blood suddenly of some value after many years of worthlessness be
in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration there was but one quite steady figure and that was a
womans see there is my husband she cried pointing him out
see defarge she stood immovable close to the grim old officer and
remained immovable close to him remained immovable close to him through
the streets as defarge and the rest bore him along remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination and began to
be struck at from behind remained immovable close to him when the
long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it that suddenly animated she put her foot
upon his neck and with her cruel knife long ready hewed off his head
the hour was come when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do saint
antoines blood was up and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the
governors body lay down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation lower
the lamp yonder cried saint antoine after glaring round for a new
means of death here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard the
swinging sentinel was posted and the sea rushed on
the sea of black and threatening waters and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes
voices of vengeance and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them
but in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life there were two groups of faces each seven in number so
fixedly contrasting with the rest that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it seven faces of prisoners suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb were carried high
overhead all scared all lost all wondering and amazed as if the last
day were come and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits
other seven faces there were carried higher seven dead faces whose
drooping eyelids and half seen eyes awaited the last day impassive
faces yet with a suspended not an abolished expression on them
faces rather in a fearful pause as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes and bear witness with the bloodless lips thou didst
seven prisoners released seven gory heads on pikes the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time long dead of broken
hearts such and such like the loudly echoing footsteps of saint
antoine escort through the paris streets in mid july one thousand seven
hundred and eighty nine now heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay
and keep these feet far out of her life for they are headlong mad
and dangerous and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at defarges wine shop door they are not easily purified when once
haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations when madame
defarge sat at her counter as usual presiding over the customers
madame defarge wore no rose in her head for the great brotherhood of
spies had become even in one short week extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saints mercies the lamps across his streets had a
madame defarge with her arms folded sat in the morning light and heat
contemplating the wine shop and the street in both there were several
knots of loungers squalid and miserable but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress the raggedest nightcap awry on
the wretchedest head had this crooked significance in it i know how
hard it has grown for me the wearer of this to support life in myself
but do you know how easy it has grown for me the wearer of this to
destroy life in you every lean bare arm that had been without work
before had this work always ready for it now that it could strike
the fingers of the knitting women were vicious with the experience that
they could tear there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression
madame defarge sat observing it with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women one of her
sisterhood knitted beside her the short rather plump wife of a starved
grocer and the mother of two children withal this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance
hark said the vengeance listen then who comes
as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine
quarter to the wine shop door had been suddenly fired a fast spreading
defarge came in breathless pulled off a red cap he wore and looked
around him listen everywhere said madame again listen to him
defarge stood panting against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths formed outside the door all those within the wine shop had
how then cried madame contemptuously the other world
does everybody here recall old foulon who told the famished people
that they might eat grass and who died and went to hell
the news is of him he is among us
among us from the universal throat again and dead
not dead he feared us so much and with reason that he caused himself
to be represented as dead and had a grand mock funeral but they have
found him alive hiding in the country and have brought him in i have
seen him but now on his way to the hotel de ville a prisoner i have
said that he had reason to fear us say all had he reason
wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten if he had
never known it yet he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
a moment of profound silence followed defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another the vengeance stooped and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter
patriots said defarge in a determined voice are we ready
instantly madame defarges knife was in her girdle the drum was beating
in the streets as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic and
the vengeance uttering terrific shrieks and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty furies at once was tearing from house to
the men were terrible in the bloody minded anger with which they looked
from windows caught up what arms they had and came pouring down into
the streets but the women were a sight to chill the boldest from
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded from their
children from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked they ran out with streaming hair urging one
another and themselves to madness with the wildest cries and actions
villain foulon taken my sister old foulon taken my mother miscreant
foulon taken my daughter then a score of others ran into the midst of
these beating their breasts tearing their hair and screaming foulon
alive foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass when i had no bread
to give him foulon who told my baby it might suck grass when these
breasts were dry with want o mother of god this foulon o heaven our
suffering hear me my dead baby and my withered father i swear on my
knees on these stones to avenge you on foulon husbands and brothers
and young men give us the blood of foulon give us the head of foulon
give us the heart of foulon give us the body and soul of foulon rend
foulon to pieces and dig him into the ground that grass may grow from
him with these cries numbers of the women lashed into blind frenzy
whirled about striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot
nevertheless not a moment was lost not a moment this foulon was at
the hotel de ville and might be loosed never if saint antoine knew
his own sufferings insults and wrongs armed men and women flocked out
of the quarter so fast and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in saint antoines bosom but a few old crones and the
no they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where
this old man ugly and wicked was and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets the defarges husband and wife the vengeance
and jacques three were in the first press and at no great distance
see cried madame pointing with her knife see the old villain bound
with ropes that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back
ha ha that was well done let him eat it now madame put her knife
under her arm and clapped her hands as at a play
the people immediately behind madame defarge explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them and those again explaining to
others and those to others the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands similarly during two or three hours of drawl
and the winnowing of many bushels of words madame defarges frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up with marvellous quickness at
a distance the more readily because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows knew madame defarge well and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building
at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection directly down upon the old prisoners head the favour was
too much to bear in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long went to the winds and saint antoine had got
it was known directly to the furthest confines of the crowd defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace madame defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied the vengeance and
jacques three were not yet up with them and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the hall like birds of prey from their high
perches when the cry seemed to go up all over the city bring him
down and up and head foremost on the steps of the building now on
his knees now on his feet now on his back dragged and struck at
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of
action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat
might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately
screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth once he went aloft and the rope
broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope
broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and
held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the
mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of
nor was this the end of the days bad work for saint antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when
the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched another of the
peoples enemies and insulters was coming into paris under a guard
five hundred strong in cavalry alone saint antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper seized him would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear foulon company set his head and heart on
pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolf procession
not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children
wailing and breadless then the miserable bakers shops were beset by
long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them
again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and
slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in
scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of
most other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children
and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and
it was almost morning when defarges wine shop parted with its last
knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in
saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with
her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drums was the
only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed the
vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foulon
was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint
there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together the prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it
but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of
them knew what his men would do beyond this that it would probably not
far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation
every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything was bowed down
animals men women children and the soil that bore them all worn
monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national
blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose
nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought
things to this strange that creation designed expressly for
monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must
be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it
was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like
it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase now found in hunting the people now found in hunting
the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness no the change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and
for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the
dust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it in these times as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour
and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now
a frequent presence as it advanced the mender of roads would discern
without surprise that it was a shaggy haired man of almost barbarian
aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods
such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter as he
the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill
and at the prison on the crag when he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just
they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones
nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face
it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere
he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint and
steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke
touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time after observing these operations they again joined hands
to night said the man putting the pipe in his mouth
he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village
show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill
see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you go down
here and straight through the street and past the fountain 
to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye
over the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountains
well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without
resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child will you
the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slipped off his
great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap of stones he
as the road mender plied his dusty labour and the hail clouds rolling
away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a red cap
now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used
his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account
the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen
red cap the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender
of roads with awe the traveller had travelled far and his feet were
footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed
with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes as he himself was into
sores stooping down beside him the road mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips
fortified towns with their stockades guard houses gates trenches and
drawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against
this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no
the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing then
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village roused him
good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyond the
the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village
when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed
as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there a
curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only monsieur gabelle
chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his house top
alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need
the night deepened the trees environing the old chateau keeping its
solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a
swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the
stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis
had slept east west north and south through the woods four
heavy treading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard four
lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all
but not for long presently the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous
then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front
picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches
and windows were then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter
soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the
a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away there was
spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur
gabelles door help gabelle help every one the tocsin rang
impatiently but other help if that were any there was none the
mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood
with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved
the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away
through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on
the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire
removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemen officers the
chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid help help the officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting
as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the
village was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everything
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
monsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionarys part the mender of roads once so submissive to
authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with
the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn in the roaring and
raging of the conflagration a red hot wind driving straight from the
infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with the rising
and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke
again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake
the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire
scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce
figures begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran
dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures
trudged away east west north and south along the night enshrouded
roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next
destination the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and
not only that but the village light headed with famine fire and
bell ringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a small instalment
of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in those latter
days became impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his
house summoned him to come forth for personal conference whereupon
monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel
with himself the result of that conference was that gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys this time
resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man
of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet and crush a man or two below
probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the
distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door
combined with the joy ringing for music not to mention his having an
ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour
a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur
gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the
rush candles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed
and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were
other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom
the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets where they
had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up
in their turn but the fierce figures were steadily wending east west
north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned
the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it
no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate
in such risings of fire and risings of sea the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the
flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore three years of tempest were consumed three more birthdays
of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted
monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and
this life together like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with
infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after
boldly reading the lords prayer backwards for a great number of years
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels
the shining bulls eye of the court was gone or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never been a good
eye to see with had long had the mote in it of lucifers pride
sardanapaluss luxury and a moles blindness but it had dropped
out and was gone the court from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was
all gone together royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and
the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was
come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide
as was natural the head quarters and great gathering place of
monseigneur in london was tellsons bank spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be
moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most
to be relied upon came quickest again tellsons was a munificent
house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate again those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made
provident remittances to tellsons were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren to which it must be added that every new comer
from france reported himself and his tidings at tellsons almost as
a matter of course for such variety of reasons tellsons was at that
time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this
was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous that tellsons sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran
on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sat at his desk and charles
darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice the
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now
the news exchange and was filled to overflowing it was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing
but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles
darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you 
i understand that i am too old said mr lorry
unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling a
disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you
my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence you touch
some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it is safe
enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with as to its being a disorganised city if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
house here to our house there who knows the city and the business of
old and is in tellsons confidence as to the uncertain travelling the
long journey and the winter weather if i were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellsons after all
i wish i were going myself said charles darnay somewhat restlessly
indeed you are a pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimed mr
lorry you wish you were going yourself and you a frenchman born you
my dear mr lorry it is because i am a frenchman born that the
thought which i did not mean to utter here however has passed through
my mind often one cannot help thinking having had some sympathy for
the miserable people and having abandoned something to them he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner that one might be listened to
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint only last night
after you had left us when i was talking to lucie 
when you were talking to lucie mr lorry repeated yes i wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie wishing you were going to
however i am not going said charles darnay with a smile it is
more to the purpose that you say you are
and i am in plain reality the truth is my dear charles mr lorry
glanced at the distant house and lowered his voice you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved the
lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people if some of our documents were seized or destroyed and they
might be at any time you know for who can say that paris is not set
afire to day or sacked to morrow now a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay and the burying of them or otherwise
getting of them out of harms way is within the power without loss of
precious time of scarcely any one but myself if any one and shall
i hang back when tellsons knows this and says this tellsons whose
bread i have eaten these sixty years because i am a little stiff about
the joints why i am a boy sir to half a dozen old codgers here
how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit mr lorry
tut nonsense sir and my dear charles said mr lorry glancing at
the house again you are to remember that getting things out of
paris at this present time no matter what things is next to an
impossibility papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here i speak in strict confidence it is not business like to
whisper it even to you by the strangest bearers you can imagine
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the barriers at another time our parcels would come and go as easily
as in business like old england but now everything is stopped
i really go to night for the case has become too pressing to admit of
and do you take no one with you
all sorts of people have been proposed to me but i will have nothing
to say to any of them i intend to take jerry jerry has been my
bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him
nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bull dog or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and
i must say again nonsense nonsense when i have executed this little
commission i shall perhaps accept tellsons proposal to retire and
live at my ease time enough then to think about growing old
this dialogue had taken place at mr lorrys usual desk with
monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long it was too
much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee and it
was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy to talk of this
terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown as if nothing had ever been done or
omitted to be done that had led to it as if observers of the wretched
millions in france and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous had not seen it inevitably coming
years before and had not in plain words recorded what they saw such
vapouring combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself
and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth and it was
such vapouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had
already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so
among the talkers was stryver of the kings bench bar far on his
way to state promotion and therefore loud on the theme broaching
to monseigneur his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth and doing without them and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race him darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection and darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more and remaining to interpose his
word when the thing that was to be went on to shape itself out
the house approached mr lorry and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed the house laid the letter down so close to darnay
that he saw the direction the more quickly because it was his own right
very pressing to monsieur heretofore the marquis st evremonde of
france confided to the cares of messrs tellson and co bankers
on the marriage morning doctor manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to charles darnay that the secret of this name should
be unless he the doctor dissolved the obligation kept inviolate
between them nobody else knew it to be his name his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact mr lorry could have none
no said mr lorry in reply to the house i have referred it
i think to everybody now here and no one can tell me where this
the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank there
was a general set of the current of talkers past mr lorrys desk he
held the letter out inquiringly and monseigneur looked at it in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee and monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee and this that
and the other all had something disparaging to say in french or in
english concerning the marquis who was not to be found
nephew i believe but in any case degenerate successor of the
polished marquis who was murdered said one happy to say i never
a craven who abandoned his post said another this monseigneur had
been got out of paris legs uppermost and half suffocated in a load of
infected with the new doctrines said a third eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing set himself in opposition to the last
marquis abandoned the estates when he inherited them and left them to
the ruffian herd they will recompense him now i hope as he deserves
hey cried the blatant stryver did he though is that the sort of
fellow let us look at his infamous name d n the fellow
darnay unable to restrain himself any longer touched mr stryver on
