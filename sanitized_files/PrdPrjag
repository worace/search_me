how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you
all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day
before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future he has many friends and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we
might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as
elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable
house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
mr collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made
him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the
wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her
it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days
journey yes i call it a very easy distance
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many
varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the
case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have
elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and
glancing over it said in a colder voice
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side
calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister just returned from her walk the tete a tete surprised
them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was
gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely
even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various
conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable
from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there
was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the
pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes
separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their
aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her
former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners
she believed he might have the best informed mind
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice
to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really
animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel
fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself
seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at
rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that
look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would
vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he
certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but
to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage
in the church and his cousin could have none at all
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park
unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to
prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time
therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed like
wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he
never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about
her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her
opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of
rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed
her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter
and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in
spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw
on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile she said
i did not know before that you ever walked this way
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally
do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are
no i should have turned in a moment
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she
yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it
than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak
feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and
dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for
these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater
weight i may suffer from want of money younger sons cannot marry where
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often
our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the
idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what
is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is
very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well
for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he
no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must
divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your
charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth she directly replied
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and
miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man he
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in
our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture
it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known
because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an
you may depend upon my not mentioning it
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other
particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
did mr darcy give you reasons for this interference
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
and what arts did he use to separate them
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he
only told me what i have now told you
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with
indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the
particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture
of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and
therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room
as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had
always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was
the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had
suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the
world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel
fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were her
having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding
excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither
could anything be urged against my father who though with some
peculiarities has abilities mr darcy himself need not disdain and
respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of
her mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow
that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose
pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense
and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to
her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins
seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any
revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her
a keener sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolation
to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the
next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits by all that affection could do
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in
the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently
affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the
room in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better
she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and
then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but
said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her
in vain i have struggled it will not do my feelings will not be
repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured
doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her
immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of
its being a degradation of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she
lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to
answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite
of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but
his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however
unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should
be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i
cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be
of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the
appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings
dreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he said
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at
civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance
i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will against your reason and even against your character
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have
other provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided against
you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion
was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not
you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means
of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity
can you deny that you have done it she repeated
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection
but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike
is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to
say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy
in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room
is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me
i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this
calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in
his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been
overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater
policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by
reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and
just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern
which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued
you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of
my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your
feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how
to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half an hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed
was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for
so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying
her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable
pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could
not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything
else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys
sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park
she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpike road the
park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was
tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and
look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr
darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced
her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though
in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the
gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter
which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure
i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a
slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity
elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written
quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise
full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated
from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any
intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes
which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion
should have been spared had not my character required it to be written
and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i
two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal
magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was
that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley
from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various
claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged
favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could
bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope
to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which
is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity
must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with
others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance
at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i
had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir
william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could
be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour
attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss
bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also
watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever
but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced
from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions
with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been
in error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not
scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be
easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe
her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial
conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the
marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but
there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still
existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had
myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before
me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your
mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your
father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this
representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say
farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties
was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as
you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning
the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i
described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been
seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your
sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great
natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was
no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into
hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the
work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not
reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in
town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this
concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it
was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no
other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured
mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i
am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many
years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at
school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his
own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have
been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only
fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he
had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be
his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is
many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different
manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr
darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree
you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham
has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character it adds even another motive
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to
mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long
survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham
wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders
he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he
could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying
law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed
him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the
business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection
between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly
lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free
from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation
for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured
me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he
had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in
question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was
well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not
have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every
repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your
secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to
the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed
for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by
design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and
by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and
to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her
excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed
the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and
how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place
immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr
wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which
is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr
wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either
detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but
i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our
near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of
the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me
should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning i will only add god bless you
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation
to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what
had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst
objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which
if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished
to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false
this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had
gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not
regard it that she would never look in it again
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on
nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though
she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own
words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the
will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err but when she read and re read with the closest attention the
particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions
to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down
the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with
little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read
on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could
bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town
had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as
to his real character had information been in her power she had
never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried
to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of
mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but
no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before
her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after
pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to
read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss
darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no
reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipss
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and
wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that
he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but
herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed
that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys
character though he had assured her that respect for the father would
how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not
but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as
were his manners she had never in the whole course of their
acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his
actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced
how despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided myself
on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust how humiliating is this
discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could
not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my
folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect
of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted
prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were
concerned till this moment i never knew myself
from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation
there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely
different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to
