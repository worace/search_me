logic and of the straight line hankering after the strange the
exotic the monstrous the crooked and the self contradictory as men
tantaluses of the will plebeian parvenus who knew themselves to be
incapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life and action think
of balzac for instance unrestrained workers almost destroying
themselves by work antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious and
insatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment all of them finally
shattering and sinking down at the christian cross and with right
and reason for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and
sufficiently original for an anti christian philosophy on the
whole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing high flying and
aloft up dragging class of higher men who had first to teach their
century and it is the century of the masses the conception higher
man let the german friends of richard wagner advise together as to
whether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art or whether
its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from super german
sources and impulses in which connection it may not be underrated
how indispensable paris was to the development of his type which the
strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most
decisive time and how the whole style of his proceedings of his
self apostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the french
socialistic original on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be
found to the honour of richard wagners german nature that he has
acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation
than a nineteenth century frenchman could have done owing to the
circumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the
french perhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner is
not only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible and
inimitable to the whole latter day latin race the figure of siegfried
that very free man who is probably far too free too hard too
cheerful too healthy too anti catholic for the taste of old and mellow
civilized nations he may even have been a sin against romanticism this
anti latin siegfried well wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old
sad days when anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into
politics he began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him to
preach at least the way to rome if not to walk therein that
these last words may not be misunderstood i will call to my aid a few
powerful rhymes which will even betray to less delicate ears what i
mean what i mean counter to the last wagner and his parsifal music

257 every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an
aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in
a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human
beings and requiring slavery in some form or other without the pathos
of distance such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes
out of the constant out looking and down looking of the ruling caste on
subordinates and instruments and out of their equally constant
practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a
distance that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the
longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself
the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more
comprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type man
the continued self surmounting of man to use a moral formula in
a supermoral sense to be sure one must not resign oneself to
any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an
aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for
the elevation of the type man the truth is hard let us acknowledge
unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has originated
men with a still natural nature barbarians in every terrible sense of
the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will
and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more
peaceful races perhaps trading or cattle rearing communities or upon
old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering
out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity at the commencement
the noble caste was always the barbarian caste their superiority did
not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical
power they were more complete men which at every point also implies
258 corruption as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out
among the instincts and that the foundation of the emotions called
life is convulsed is something radically different according to
the organization in which it manifests itself when for instance an
aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolution
flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself
to an excess of its moral sentiments it was corruption it was really
only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries
by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its
lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a function of royalty in
the end even to its decoration and parade dress the essential thing
however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard
itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but
as the significance and highest justification thereof that it should
therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion
of individuals who for its sake must be suppressed and reduced to
imperfect men to slaves and instruments its fundamental belief must
be precisely that society is not allowed to exist for its own sake but
only as a foundation and scaffolding by means of which a select class
of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties and
in general to a higher existence like those sun seeking climbing plants
in java they are called sipo matador which encircle an oak so
long and so often with their arms until at last high above it but
supported by it they can unfold their tops in the open light and
259 to refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation
and put ones will on a par with that of others this may result in a
certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary
conditions are given namely the actual similarity of the individuals
in amount of force and degree of worth and their co relation within one
organization as soon however as one wished to take this principle
more generally and if possible even as the fundamental principle of
society it would immediately disclose what it really is namely a will
to the denial of life a principle of dissolution and decay here one
must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental
weakness life itself is essentially appropriation injury conquest
of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of
peculiar forms incorporation and at the least putting it mildest
exploitation but why should one for ever use precisely these words
on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped even the
organization within which as was previously supposed the
individuals treat each other as equal it takes place in every
healthy aristocracy must itself if it be a living and not a dying
organization do all that towards other bodies which the individuals
within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the
incarnated will to power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground
attract to itself and acquire ascendancy not owing to any morality or
immorality but because it lives and because life is precisely will to
power on no point however is the ordinary consciousness of europeans
more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave
everywhere even under the guise of science about coming conditions of
society in which the exploiting character is to be absent that sounds
to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should
refrain from all organic functions exploitation does not belong to a
depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of
the living being as a primary organic function it is a consequence
of the intrinsic will to power which is precisely the will to
life granting that as a theory this is a novelty as a reality it is
the fundamental fact of all history let us be so far honest towards
260 in a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have
hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth i found certain traits
recurring regularly together and connected with one another until
finally two primary types revealed themselves to me and a radical
distinction was brought to light there is master morality and
slave morality i would at once add however that in all higher and
mixed civilizations there are also attempts at the reconciliation of
the two moralities but one finds still oftener the confusion and
mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close
juxtaposition even in the same man within one soul the distinctions
of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly
conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class
the slaves and dependents of all sorts in the first case when it is
the rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud
disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature and that
which determines the order of rank the noble type of man separates
from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted proud
disposition displays itself he despises them let it at once be noted
that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad
means practically the same as noble and despicable the antithesis
good and evil is of a different origin the cowardly the timid the
insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised
moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glances the
self abasing the dog like kind of men who let themselves be abused
the mendicant flatterers and above all the liars it is a fundamental
belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful we
truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is
obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first
applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied
to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals
start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised
the noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values he
does not require to be approved of he passes the judgment what is
injurious to me is injurious in itself he knows that it is he himself
only who confers honour on things he is a creator of values he
honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals
self glorification in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude
of power which seeks to overflow the happiness of high tension the
consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow the noble
man also helps the unfortunate but not or scarcely out of pity but
rather from an impulse generated by the super abundance of power the
noble man honours in himself the powerful one him also who has power
over himself who knows how to speak and how to keep silence who
takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and has
reverence for all that is severe and hard wotan placed a hard heart in
my breast says an old scandinavian saga it is thus rightly expressed
from the soul of a proud viking such a type of man is even proud of not
being made for sympathy the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly
he who has not a hard heart when young will never have one the noble
and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality
which sees precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others
or in desinteressement the characteristic of the moral faith
in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards
selflessness belong as definitely to noble morality as do a careless
scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart it
is the powerful who know how to honour it is their art their domain
for invention the profound reverence for age and for tradition all law
rests on this double reverence the belief and prejudice in favour of
ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers is typical in the morality of
the powerful and if reversely men of modern ideas believe almost
instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more
lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these ideas has
complacently betrayed itself thereby a morality of the ruling class
however is more especially foreign and irritating to present day taste
in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to ones
equals that one may act towards beings of a lower rank towards all
that is foreign just as seems good to one or as the heart desires
and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and
similar sentiments can have a place the ability and obligation to
exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge both only within the
circle of equals artfulness in retaliation raffinement of the idea
in friendship a certain necessity to have enemies as outlets for the
emotions of envy quarrelsomeness arrogance in fact in order to be
a good friend all these are typical characteristics of the noble
morality which as has been pointed out is not the morality of modern
ideas and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to
unearth and disclose it is otherwise with the second type of morality
slave morality supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering
the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should
moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimates
probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of
man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with
his situation the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the
powerful he has a skepticism and distrust a refinement of distrust of
everything good that is there honoured he would fain persuade himself
that the very happiness there is not genuine on the other hand those
qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are
brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that
sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence
humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most
useful qualities and almost the only means of supporting the burden of
existence slave morality is essentially the morality of utility
here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and
evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil
a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of
being despised according to slave morality therefore the evil man
arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good
man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is
regarded as the despicable being the contrast attains its maximum when
in accordance with the logical consequences of slave morality a shade
of depreciation it may be slight and well intentioned at last attaches
itself to the good man of this morality because according to the
servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the safe
man he is good natured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un
bonhomme everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language
shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good
and stupid a last fundamental difference the desire for freedom
the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty
belong as necessarily to slave morals and morality as artifice and
enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an
aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating hence we can understand
without further detail why love as a passion it is our european
specialty must absolutely be of noble origin as is well known its
invention is due to the provencal poet cavaliers those brilliant
ingenious men of the gai saber to whom europe owes so much and
261 vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for
a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another
kind of man thinks he sees it self evidently the problem for him is
to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of
themselves which they themselves do not possess and consequently also
do not deserve and who yet believe in this good opinion
afterwards this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so
self disrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable
that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful
about it in most cases when it is spoken of he will say for
instance i may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand
may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others
precisely as i rate it that however is not vanity but self conceit
or in most cases that which is called humility and also
modesty or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in
the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them
and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion
endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps
because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share
it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however
is not vanity the man of noble character must first bring it home
forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from
time immemorial in all social strata in any way dependent the ordinary
man was only that which he passed for not being at all accustomed to
fix values he did not assign even to himself any other value than that
which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of masters to
create values it may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary
atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always waiting
for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself
to it yet by no means only to a good opinion but also to a bad
and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the
self appreciations and self depreciations which believing women learn
from their confessors and which in general the believing christian
learns from his church in fact conformably to the slow rise of the
democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood
of masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse of
the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of
themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but
it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained
propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older
propensity overmasters the younger the vain person rejoices over every
good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point
of view of its usefulness and equally regardless of its truth or
falsehood just as he suffers from every bad opinion for he subjects
himself to both he feels himself subjected to both by that oldest
instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him it is the slave
in the vain mans blood the remains of the slaves craftiness and how
much of the slave is still left in woman for instance which
seeks to seduce to good opinions of itself it is the slave too who
immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions as
though he had not called them forth and to repeat it again vanity is
262 a species originates and a type becomes established and strong in
the long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable conditions on
the other hand it is known by the experience of breeders that species
which receive super abundant nourishment and in general a surplus of
protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop
variations and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities also in
monstrous vices now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say
an ancient greek polis or venice as a voluntary or involuntary
contrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings there are there men
beside one another thrown upon their own resources who want to make
their species prevail chiefly because they must prevail or else
run the terrible danger of being exterminated the favour the
super abundance the protection are there lacking under which variations
are fostered the species needs itself as species as something which
precisely by virtue of its hardness its uniformity and simplicity of
structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in
constant struggle with its neighbours or with rebellious or
rebellion threatening vassals the most varied experience teaches it
what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that
it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been
victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone
it develops to maturity it does so with severity indeed it desires
severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education
of youth in the control of women in the marriage customs in the
relations of old and young in the penal laws which have an eye only
for the degenerating it counts intolerance itself among the virtues
under the name of justice a type with few but very marked features
a species of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent
men and as such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and
nuances of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitudes
of generations the constant struggle with uniform unfavourable
conditions is as already remarked the cause of a type becoming
stable and hard finally however a happy state of things results the
enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemies among the
neighbouring peoples and the means of life even of the enjoyment
of life are present in superabundance with one stroke the bond and
constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded as
necessary as a condition of existence if it would continue it can
only do so as a form of luxury as an archaizing taste variations
whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or
deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the
greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dares to be individual
and detach himself at this turning point of history there manifest
themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a
magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a
kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary
decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly
exploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and light
and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for
themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality it was this
morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent
the bow in so threatening a manner it is now out of date it is
getting out of date the dangerous and disquieting point has been
reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life is
lived beyond the old morality the individual stands out and is
obliged to have recourse to his own law giving his own arts and
artifices for self preservation self elevation and self deliverance
nothing but new whys nothing but new hows no common formulas any
longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay
deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the
genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad
a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms
and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied
corruption danger is again present the mother of morality great
danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and
friend into the street into their own child into their own heart
into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and
volitions what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have
to preach they discover these sharp onlookers and loafers that the
end is quickly approaching that everything around them decays and
produces decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow
except one species of man the incurably mediocre the mediocre alone
have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves they will
be the men of the future the sole survivors be like them become
mediocre is now the only morality which has still a significance
which still obtains a hearing but it is difficult to preach this
morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it
desires it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly
love it will have difficulty in concealing its irony
263 there is an instinct for rank which more than anything else is
already the sign of a high rank there is a delight in the nuances
of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits the
refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test
when something passes by that is of the highest rank but is not
yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and
incivilities something that goes its way like a living touchstone
and disguised he whose task and practice it is to investigate souls
will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the
ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which
it belongs he will test it by its instinct for reverence difference
engendre haine the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like
dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrines any
book bearing the marks of great destiny is brought before it while
on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the
eye a cessation of all gestures by which it is indicated that a soul
feels the nearness of what is worthiest of respect the way in which on
the whole the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintained
in europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of
manners which europe owes to christianity books of such profoundness
and supreme significance require for their protection an external
tyranny of authority in order to acquire the period of thousands of
years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them much has been
achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses
the shallow pates and the boobies of every kind that they are not
allowed to touch everything that there are holy experiences before
which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand it
is almost their highest advance towards humanity on the contrary in
the so called cultured classes the believers in modern ideas nothing
is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame the easy insolence of
eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it
is possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste and
more tact for reverence among the people among the lower classes of
the people especially among peasants than among the newspaper reading
264 it cannot be effaced from a mans soul what his ancestors have
preferably and most constantly done whether they were perhaps diligent
economizers attached to a desk and a cash box modest and citizen like
in their desires modest also in their virtues or whether they were
accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasures
and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities or whether
finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privileges of
birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faith for their
god as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blushes
at every compromise it is quite impossible for a man not to have
the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his
constitution whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary this is
the problem of race granted that one knows something of the parents
it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind
of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy
self vaunting the three things which together have constituted the
genuine plebeian type in all times such must pass over to the child as
surely as bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture
one will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredity and
what else does education and culture try to do nowadays in our very
democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must
be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin
with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul an educator
who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out
constantly to his pupils be true be natural show yourselves as you
are even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time
to have recourse to the furca of horace naturam expellere with what
265 at the risk of displeasing innocent ears i submit that egoism
belongs to the essence of a noble soul i mean the unalterable belief
that to a being such as we other beings must naturally be in
subjection and have to sacrifice themselves the noble soul accepts the
fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of
harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as something
that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a
designation for it he would say it is justice itself he acknowledges
under certain circumstances which made him hesitate at first that
there are other equally privileged ones as soon as he has settled this
question of rank he moves among those equals and equally privileged
ones with the same assurance as regards modesty and delicate respect
which he enjoys in intercourse with himself in accordance with an
innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand it is an
additional instance of his egoism this artfulness and self limitation
in intercourse with his equals every star is a similar egoist he
honours himself in them and in the rights which he concedes to them he
has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights as the essence of
all intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of things the
noble soul gives as he takes prompted by the passionate and sensitive
instinct of requital which is at the root of his nature the notion of
favour has inter pares neither significance nor good repute there
may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from
above and of drinking them thirstily like dew drops but for those
arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude his egoism hinders him
here in general he looks aloft unwillingly he looks either forward
horizontally and deliberately or downwards he knows that he is on a
266 one can only truly esteem him who does not look out for
267 the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children
siao sin make thy heart small this is the essentially fundamental
tendency in latter day civilizations i have no doubt that an ancient
greek also would first of all remark the self dwarfing in us europeans
of today in this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful
268 what after all is ignobleness words are vocal symbols for
ideas ideas however are more or less definite mental symbols
for frequently returning and concurring sensations for groups of
sensations it is not sufficient to use the same words in order to
understand one another we must also employ the same words for the same
kind of internal experiences we must in the end have experiences in
common on this account the people of one nation understand one another
better than those belonging to different nations even when they use
the same language or rather when people have lived long together under
similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil there
originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a
nation in all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences
have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely about
these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more
rapidly the history of language is the history of a process of
abbreviation on the basis of this quick comprehension people always
unite closer and closer the greater the danger the greater is the
need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to
misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be
dispensed with in intercourse also in all loves and friendships one has
the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery
has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has
feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of
the other the fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good
genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too
hasty attachments to which sense and heart prompt them and not some
schopenhauerian genius of the species whichever groups of sensations
within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of
command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and
determine ultimately its list of desirable things a mans estimates of
value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it
sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs supposing now that
necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could
express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols
it results on the whole that the easy communicability of need
which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and common
experiences must have been the most potent of all the forces which
have hitherto operated upon mankind the more similar the more ordinary
people have always had and are still having the advantage the more
select more refined more unique and difficultly comprehensible are
liable to stand alone they succumb to accidents in their isolation and
seldom propagate themselves one must appeal to immense opposing forces
in order to thwart this natural all too natural progressus in simile
the evolution of man to the similar the ordinary the average the
269 the more a psychologist a born an unavoidable psychologist
and soul diviner turns his attention to the more select cases and
individuals the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy
he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man for
the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually
constituted souls is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a
rule always before ones eyes the manifold torment of the psychologist
who has discovered this ruination who discovers once and then
discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history this universal
inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every
sense may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with
bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at
self destruction of his going to ruin himself one may perceive
in almost every psychologist a tell tale inclination for delightful
intercourse with commonplace and well ordered men the fact is thereby
disclosed that he always requires healing that he needs a sort
of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and
incisiveness from what his business has laid upon his conscience
the fear of his memory is peculiar to him he is easily silenced by the
judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour
admire love and glorify where he has perceived or he even conceals
his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion perhaps
the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely
where he has learnt great sympathy together with great contempt the
multitude the educated and the visionaries have on their part learnt
great reverence reverence for great men and marvelous animals for
the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland the earth the
dignity of mankind and ones own self to whom one points the young
and in view of whom one educates them and who knows but in all great
instances hitherto just the same happened that the multitude worshipped
a god and that the god was only a poor sacrificial animal success
has always been the greatest liar and the work itself is a success
the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in
their creations until they are unrecognizable the work of the artist
of the philosopher only invents him who has created it is reputed
to have created it the great men as they are reverenced are poor
little fictions composed afterwards in the world of historical values
spurious coinage prevails those great poets for example such as
byron musset poe leopardi kleist gogol i do not venture to mention
much greater names but i have them in my mind as they now appear and
were perhaps obliged to be men of the moment enthusiastic sensuous
and childish light minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust
with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed often taking
revenge with their works for an internal defilement often seeking
forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in
the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the
will o the wisps around the swamps and pretend to be stars the people
then call them idealists often struggling with protracted disgust
with an ever reappearing phantom of disbelief which makes them cold
and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour faith as it is
out of the hands of intoxicated adulators what a torment these great
artists are and the so called higher men in general to him who has once
found them out it is thus conceivable that it is just from woman who
is clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eager
to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers that they have
learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy which
the multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understand
and overwhelm with prying and self gratifying interpretations this
sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power woman would
like to believe that love can do everything it is the superstition
peculiar to her alas he who knows the heart finds out how poor
helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love
is he finds that it rather destroys than saves it is possible that
under the holy fable and travesty of the life of jesus there is hidden
one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love
the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that
never had enough of any human love that demanded love that demanded
inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible
outbursts against those who refused him their love the story of a poor
soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send
thither those who would not love him and that at last enlightened
about human love had to invent a god who is entire love entire
capacity for love who takes pity on human love because it is so
paltry so ignorant he who has such sentiments he who has such
knowledge about love seeks for death but why should one deal with
such painful matters provided of course that one is not obliged to do
270 the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has
suffered deeply it almost determines the order of rank how deeply men
can suffer the chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbued
and coloured that by virtue of his suffering he knows more than the
shrewdest and wisest can ever know that he has been familiar with
and at home in many distant dreadful worlds of which you know
nothing this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer this
pride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almost
sacrificed finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from
contact with officious and sympathizing hands and in general from all
that is not its equal in suffering profound suffering makes noble
it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism
along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes
suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that
is sorrowful and profound they are gay men who make use of gaiety
because they are misunderstood on account of it they wish to be
misunderstood there are scientific minds who make use of science
because it gives a gay appearance and because scientificness leads to
the conclusion that a person is superficial they wish to mislead to a
false conclusion there are free insolent minds which would fain conceal
and deny that they are broken proud incurable hearts the cynicism of
hamlet the case of galiani and occasionally folly itself is the mask
of an unfortunate over assured knowledge from which it follows that it
is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask
and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place
271 that which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense
and grade of purity what does it matter about all their honesty and
reciprocal usefulness what does it matter about all their mutual
good will the fact still remains they cannot smell each other the
highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the
most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just
holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question any
kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath
any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out
of night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction into
clearness brightness depth and refinement just as much as such a
tendency distinguishes it is a noble tendency it also separates the
pity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human all too human
and there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as
272 signs of nobility never to think of lowering our duties to the
rank of duties for everybody to be unwilling to renounce or to share
our responsibilities to count our prerogatives and the exercise of
273 a man who strives after great things looks upon every one whom
he encounters on his way either as a means of advance or a delay and
hindrance or as a temporary resting place his peculiar lofty bounty
to his fellow men is only possible when he attains his elevation and
dominates impatience and the consciousness of being always condemned
to comedy up to that time for even strife is a comedy and conceals the
end as every means does spoil all intercourse for him this kind of
man is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it
274 the problem of those who wait happy chances are necessary and
many incalculable elements in order that a higher man in whom the
solution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forth
as one might say at the right moment on an average it does not happen
and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who
hardly know to what extent they are waiting and still less that they
wait in vain occasionally too the waking call comes too late the
chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth
and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many
a one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are
benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy it is too late he has
said to himself and has become self distrustful and henceforth for ever
useless in the domain of genius may not the raphael without
hands taking the expression in its widest sense perhaps not be the
exception but the rule perhaps genius is by no means so rare but
rather the five hundred hands which it requires in order to tyrannize
over the greek inserted here the right time in order to take
275 he who does not wish to see the height of a man looks all the
more sharply at what is low in him and in the foreground and thereby
276 in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is
better off than the nobler soul the dangers of the latter must be
greater the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in
fact immense considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its
existence in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost not so
277 it is too bad always the old story when a man has finished
building his house he finds that he has learnt unawares something
which he ought absolutely to have known before he began to build the
eternal fatal too late the melancholia of everything completed 
278 wanderer who art thou i see thee follow thy path without scorn
without love with unfathomable eyes wet and sad as a plummet which has
returned to the light insatiated out of every depth what did it seek
down there with a bosom that never sighs with lips that conceal their
loathing with a hand which only slowly grasps who art thou what
hast thou done rest thee here this place has hospitality for every
one refresh thyself and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases
thee what will serve to refresh thee only name it whatever i have
i offer thee to refresh me to refresh me oh thou prying one

281 will people believe it of me but i insist that they believe it
of me i have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about
myself only in very rare cases only compulsorily always without
delight in the subject ready to digress from myself and always
without faith in the result owing to an unconquerable distrust of the
possibility of self knowledge which has led me so far as to feel a
contradictio in adjecto even in the idea of direct knowledge which
theorists allow themselves this matter of fact is almost the most
certain thing i know about myself there must be a sort of repugnance
in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps
some enigma therein probably but fortunately nothing for my own
teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to
282 but what has happened to you i do not know he said
hesitatingly perhaps the harpies have flown over my table it
sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle sober retiring man becomes
suddenly mad breaks the plates upsets the table shrieks raves
and shocks everybody and finally withdraws ashamed and raging at
himself whither for what purpose to famish apart to suffocate with
his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul
and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared the danger
will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so
thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age with which he does
not like to eat out of the same dish he may readily perish of hunger
and thirst or should he nevertheless finally fall to of sudden
nausea we have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong
and precisely the most spiritual of us who are most difficult to
nourish know the dangerous dyspepsia which originates from a sudden
insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates the
283 if one wishes to praise at all it is a delicate and at the
same time a noble self control to praise only where one does not
agree otherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary
to good taste a self control to be sure which offers excellent
opportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding to be able to
allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must
not live among intellectual imbeciles but rather among men whose
misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement or one will
have to pay dearly for it he praises me therefore he acknowledges me
to be right this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life
of us recluses for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and
284 to live in a vast and proud tranquility always beyond to have
or not to have ones emotions ones for and against according to
choice to lower oneself to them for hours to seat oneself on them as
upon horses and often as upon asses for one must know how to make
use of their stupidity as well as of their fire to conserve ones
three hundred foregrounds also ones black spectacles for there are
circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes still less into our
motives and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice
politeness and to remain master of ones four virtues courage

a sublime bent and bias to purity which divines that in the contact of
man and man in society it must be unavoidably impure all society
285 the greatest events and thoughts the greatest thoughts however
are the greatest events are longest in being comprehended the
generations which are contemporary with them do not experience such
events they live past them something happens there as in the realm of
stars the light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man and
before it has arrived man denies that there are stars there how
many centuries does a mind require to be understood that is also a
standard one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith
such as is necessary for mind and for star

reverse kind of man who is also upon a height and has also a free
287 what is noble what does the word noble still mean for us
nowadays how does the noble man betray himself how is he recognized
under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which
everything is rendered opaque and leaden it is not his actions which
establish his claim actions are always ambiguous always inscrutable
neither is it his works one finds nowadays among artists and scholars
plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for
nobleness impels them but this very need of nobleness is radically
different from the needs of the noble soul itself and is in fact the
eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof it is not the works
but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of
rank to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper
meaning it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about
itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and
perhaps also is not to be lost the noble soul has reverence for
288 there are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn
and twist themselves as they will and hold their hands before their
treacherous eyes as though the hand were not a betrayer it always
comes out at last that they have something which they hide namely
intellect one of the subtlest means of deceiving at least as long as
possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider
than one really is which in everyday life is often as desirable as
an umbrella is called enthusiasm including what belongs to it for
instance virtue for as galiani said who was obliged to know it vertu
289 in the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo
of the wilderness something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance
of solitude in his strongest words even in his cry itself there
sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment he who
has sat day and night from years end to years end alone with his
soul in familiar discord and discourse he who has become a cave bear
or a treasure seeker or a treasure guardian and dragon in his cave it
may be a labyrinth but can also be a gold mine his ideas themselves
eventually acquire a twilight colour of their own and an odour as much
of the depth as of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive
which blows chilly upon every passer by the recluse does not believe
that a philosopher supposing that a philosopher has always in the first
place been a recluse ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in
books are not books written precisely to hide what is in us indeed
he will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actual
opinions at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must
necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer
world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every
foundation every philosophy is a foreground philosophy this is a
recluses verdict there is something arbitrary in the fact that the
philosopher came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around
that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper there
is also something suspicious in it every philosophy also conceals a
philosophy every opinion is also a lurking place every word is also a

misunderstood the latter perhaps wounds his vanity but the former
wounds his heart his sympathy which always says ah why would you
also have as hard a time of it as i have
291 man a complex mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny
to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his
strength has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his
soul as something simple and the whole of morality is a long audacious
falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of
the soul becomes possible from this point of view there is perhaps much
more in the conception of art than is generally believed
292 a philosopher that is a man who constantly experiences sees
hears suspects hopes and dreams extraordinary things who is struck
by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside from above and
below as a species of events and lightning flashes peculiar to him who
is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings a portentous
man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and
something uncanny going on a philosopher alas a being who often
runs away from himself is often afraid of himself but whose curiosity
293 a man who says i like that i take it for my own and mean to
guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case
carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman
punish and overthrow insolence a man who has his indignation and his
sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the
animals willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a
master by nature when such a man has sympathy well that sympathy has
value but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer or of
those even who preach sympathy there is nowadays throughout almost the
whole of europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain
and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing
which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seeks
to deck itself out as something superior there is a regular cult of
suffering the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such
groups of visionaries is always i believe the first thing that
strikes the eye one must resolutely and radically taboo this latest
form of bad taste and finally i wish people to put the good amulet
gai saber gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck as
294 the olympian vice despite the philosopher who as a genuine
englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking
minds laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every
thinking mind will strive to overcome hobbes i would even
allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their
laughing up to those who are capable of golden laughter and supposing
that gods also philosophize which i am strongly inclined to believe
owing to many reasons i have no doubt that they also know how to laugh
thereby in an overman like and new fashion and at the expense of all
serious things gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they cannot
295 the genius of the heart as that great mysterious one possesses
it the tempter god and born rat catcher of consciences whose voice can
descend into the nether world of every soul who neither speaks a word
nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch
of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to
appear not as he is but in a guise which acts as an additional
constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow him
more cordially and thoroughly the genius of the heart which imposes
silence and attention on everything loud and self conceited which
smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing to lie placid
as a mirror that the deep heavens may be reflected in them the genius
of the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate
and to grasp more delicately which scents the hidden and forgotten
treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark
ice and is a divining rod for every grain of gold long buried and
imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with
which every one goes away richer not favoured or surprised not as
though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others but richer
in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a
thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more
bruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new will
and current full of a new ill will and counter current but what am i
doing my friends of whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myself
so far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that you
have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god
and spirit is that wishes to be praised in such a manner for as it
happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his
legs and in foreign lands i have also encountered on my path many
strange and dangerous spirits above all however and again and again
the one of whom i have just spoken in fact no less a personage than
the god dionysus the great equivocator and tempter to whom as you
know i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first fruits the
last as it seems to me who has offered a sacrifice to him for i
have found no one who could understand what i was then doing in
the meantime however i have learned much far too much about the
philosophy of this god and as i said from mouth to mouth i the last
disciple and initiate of the god dionysus and perhaps i might at last
begin to give you my friends as far as i am allowed a little taste of
this philosophy in a hushed voice as is but seemly for it has to do
with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny the
very fact that dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore gods also
philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might
perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers among you my
friends there is less to be said against it except that it comes too
late and not at the right time for as it has been disclosed to me you
are loth nowadays to believe in god and gods it may happen too that
in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the
strict usages of your ears certainly the god in question went further
very much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead of
me indeed if it were allowed i should have to give him according
to human usage fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit i should
have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer his fearless
honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom but such a god does not know
what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp keep that he
would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require
it i have no reason to cover my nakedness one suspects that this
kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame he once said
under certain circumstances i love mankind and referred thereby to
ariadne who was present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave
inventive animal that has not his equal upon earth he makes his way
even through all labyrinths i like man and often think how i can
still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more
profound stronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror
yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more
beautiful and thereby the tempter god smiled with his halcyon smile
as though he had just paid some charming compliment one here sees at
once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks and in general
there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the gods could
all of them come to us men for instruction we men are more human
296 alas what are you after all my written and painted thoughts not
long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorns
and secret spices that you made me sneeze and laugh and now you
have already doffed your novelty and some of you i fear are ready
to become truths so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so
tedious and was it ever otherwise what then do we write and paint
we mandarins with chinese brush we immortalisers of things which lend
themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting alas only
that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour alas
only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments alas
only birds strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be
