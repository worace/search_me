and she began to hum these words to a gay air
jai faim mon pere i am hungry father
jai froid ma mere i am cold mother
she had hardly finished this couplet when she exclaimed
do you ever go to the play monsieur marius i do i have a little
brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets
sometimes but i dont like the benches in the galleries one is cramped
and uncomfortable there there are rough people there sometimes and
then she scrutinized marius assumed a singular air and said
do you know mr marius that you are a very handsome fellow
and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made
her smile and him blush she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his
shoulder you pay no heed to me but i know you mr marius i meet you
here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named
father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i
have been strolling in that quarter it is very becoming to you to have
she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very
deep a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to
her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing
mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package
which belongs to you i think permit me to return it to you
and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as
dieu de dieu how my sister and i have hunted and it was you who found
it on the boulevard was it not it must have been on the boulevard
you see we let it fall when we were running it was that brat of a
sister of mine who was so stupid when we got home we could not find it
anywhere as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that
is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had
carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us
nix so here they are those poor letters and how did you find out
that they belonged to me ah yes the writing so it was you that we
jostled as we passed last night we couldnt see i said to my sister
is it a gentleman my sister said to me i think it is a gentleman
in the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the
benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas
here said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass by the
way this is his hour ill go and carry it to him perhaps he will give
then she began to laugh again and added
do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today it will mean
that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our
breakfast of yesterday our dinner of to day and all that at once and
this morning come parbleu if you are not satisfied dogs burst
this reminded marius of the wretched girls errand to himself he
fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there
the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius
i often go off in the evening sometimes i dont come home again last
winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges
we huddled together to keep from freezing my little sister cried how
melancholy the water is when i thought of drowning myself i said
to myself no its too cold i go out alone whenever i choose i
sometimes sleep in the ditches do you know at night when i walk along
the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and
as big as notre dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say
to myself why theres water there the stars are like the lamps in
illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew
them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears
although it is night i hear hand organs and spinning machines and i
dont know what all i think people are flinging stones at me i flee
without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls you feel very
and then she stared at him with a bewildered air
by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally
collected five francs sixteen sous this was all he owned in the world
for the moment at all events he thought there is my dinner for
to day and to morrow we will see he kept the sixteen sous and handed
and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the
avalanches of slang in her brain she went on
five francs the shiner a monarch in this hole aint this fine
youre a jolly thief im your humble servant bravo for the good
fellows two days wine and meat and stew well have a royal feast
she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius
then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying
good morning sir its all right ill go and find my old man
as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode
which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it and
thats good its hard it breaks my teeth
marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in
distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery true
misery he had but just had a view of it was its spectre which had just
passed before his eyes in fact he who has only beheld the misery of
man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who
has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the
when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last
resources at the same time woe to the defenceless beings who surround
him work wages bread fire courage good will all fail him
simultaneously the light of day seems extinguished without the moral
light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the
woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy
then all horrors become possible despair is surrounded with fragile
partitions which all open on either vice or crime
health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the
heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated
in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources which
encounters opprobrium and which accommodates itself to it fathers
mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters adhere
and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky
promiscuousness of sexes relationships ages infamies and innocences
they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of fate they exchange
woe begone glances oh the unfortunate wretches how pale they are how
cold they are it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further
this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad
shadows she revealed to him a hideous side of the night
marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and
passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up
to that day the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement
which any one would have yielded to but he marius should have done
better than that what only a wall separated him from those abandoned
beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of
the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the
last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or
rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no heed to
them every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side
of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even
lend an ear and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen
to them his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible
radiances to loves in the air to follies and all the while human
creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people
were agonizing in vain beside him he even formed a part of their
misfortune and he aggravated it for if they had had another neighbor
who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable
man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of
distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold
of and rescued they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no
doubt very vile very odious even but those who fall without becoming
degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and
the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal word
the miserable whose fault is this and then should not the charity be
all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great
while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on
which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and
scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which
separated him from the jondrettes as though he were able to make his
gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched
people the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams
and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and
words to be clearly distinguished only a man as dreamy as marius could
have failed to perceive this long before there was no paper pasted on
the wall either on the side of the jondrettes or on that of marius the
coarse construction was visible in its nakedness marius examined the
and scrutinizes as thought would all at once he sprang up he had just
perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which
resulted from the space between three lathes the plaster which should
have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode
a view could be had through this aperture into the jondrettes attic
commiseration has and should have its curiosity this aperture formed
a sort of peep hole it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a
let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought
he climbed upon the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked
chapter vi the wild man in his lair
cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked
and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves only
in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and
petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is
ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful taking one lair
with another the beasts is preferable to the mans caverns are better
marius was poor and his chamber was poverty stricken but as his
poverty was noble his garret was neat the den upon which his eye now
rested was abject dirty fetid pestiferous mean sordid the only
furniture consisted of a straw chair an infirm table some old bits of
crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all
the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes draped with
spiders webs through this aperture there penetrated just enough light
to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom the walls
had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a
visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded
from them obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be
the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this
one was neither tiled nor planked its inhabitants stepped directly
on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the
long continued pressure of feet upon this uneven floor where the dirt
seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity
that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old
shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace
so it was let for forty francs a year there was every sort of thing
in that fireplace a brazier a pot broken boards rags suspended
from nails a bird cage ashes and even a little fire two brands were
one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that
it was large it had projections and angles and black holes the lower
sides of roofs bays and promontories hence horrible unfathomable
nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as ones fist wood lice
as large as ones foot and perhaps even who knows some monstrous
one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window one
end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius in a corner near the
aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black
frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large
letters was the inscription the dream this represented a sleeping
woman and a child also asleep the child on the womans lap an eagle
in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the
crown away from the childs head without awaking the latter in the
background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a
beneath this frame a sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it
was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against
the wall it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to
the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some
pier glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting
near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and paper sat
a man about sixty years of age small thin livid haggard with a
cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel
if lavater had studied this visage he would have found the vulture
mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifogger
rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the
pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the
this man had a long gray beard he was clad in a womans chemise which
allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair
to be seen beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which
he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking there was no bread in the
he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had
on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume
and the size which was the antique 12mo of reading rooms betrayed a
romance on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large
capitals god the king honor and the ladies by ducray duminil 1814
as the man wrote he talked aloud and marius heard his words
the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead just look
at pere lachaise the great those who are rich are up above in the
acacia alley which is paved they can reach it in a carriage the
little people the poor the unhappy well what of them they are put
down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places they
are put there so that they will decay the sooner you cannot go to see
he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his
a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was
crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels
she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched
with bits of old cloth a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her
petticoat although this woman was doubled up and bent together it
could be seen that she was of very lofty stature she was a sort of
giant beside her husband she had hideous hair of a reddish blond
which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time
with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails
beside her on the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the
other and probably a volume of the same romance
on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale
young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did
not seem to be listening or seeing or living
no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age on closer scrutiny it
was evident that she really was fourteen she was the child who had
said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted
she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time
then suddenly starts up rapidly it is indigence which produces these
melancholy human plants these creatures have neither childhood nor
youth at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they
seem twenty to day a little girl to morrow a woman one might say
that they stride through life in order to get through with it the more
at this moment this being had the air of a child
moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft
no spinning wheel not a tool in one corner lay some ironmongery of
dubious aspect it was the dull listlessness which follows despair and
marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than
the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt fluttering
there and life was palpitating there the garret the cellar the lowly
ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the
social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber
but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance
of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by
side with them places its greatest miseries in that vestibule
the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did
not even seem to breathe the scratching of the pen on the paper was
the man grumbled without pausing in his writing canaille canaille
this variation to solomons exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman
calm yourself my little friend she said dont hurt yourself my
dear you are too good to write to all those people husband
bodies press close to each other in misery as in cold but hearts draw
apart this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging
from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and
reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the
whole group this had become extinct there no longer existed in her
anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband nevertheless
caressing appellations had survived as is often the case she called
him my dear my little friend my good man etc with her mouth while
marius with a load upon his breast was on the point of descending
from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound
attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post
the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly the eldest girl made
her appearance on the threshold on her feet she had large coarse
mens shoes bespattered with mud which had splashed even to her red
ankles and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters
marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably
deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity
and had picked it up again on emerging she entered pushed the door to
behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless
then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy
the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the
how are you sure if he is coming in a fiacre how is it that you
arrive before him you gave him our address at least did you tell him
that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right if
he only does not make a mistake so you found him at the church did he
read my letter what did he say to you
ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my good man see
here i entered the church he was in his usual place i made him a
reverence and i handed him the letter he read it and said to me
where do you live my child i said monsieur i will show you he
said to me no give me your address my daughter has some purchases to
make i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that
you do i gave him the address when i mentioned the house he seemed
surprised and hesitated for an instant then he said never mind i
will come when the mass was finished i watched him leave the church
with his daughter and i saw them enter a carriage i certainly did tell
him the last door in the corridor on the right
and what makes you think that he will come
i have just seen the fiacre turn into the rue petit banquier that is
how do you know that it was the same fiacre
because i took notice of the number so there
the girl stared boldly at her father and showing the shoes which she
a clever girl possibly but i tell you i wont put these shoes on
again and that i wont for the sake of my health in the first place
and for the sake of cleanliness in the next i dont know anything
more irritating than shoes that squelch and go ghi ghi ghi the whole
you are right said her father in a sweet tone which contrasted with
the young girls rudeness but then you will not be allowed to enter
churches for poor people must have shoes to do that one cannot go
barefoot to the good god he added bitterly
then returning to the subject which absorbed him
so you are sure that he will come
he is following on my heels said she
the man started up a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance
wife he exclaimed you hear here is the philanthropist extinguish
the father with the agility of an acrobat seized a broken nosed jug
which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands
here you pull the straw off that chair
he seized the chair and with one kick he rendered it seatless his leg
as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter
the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the
window and shouted to her in a thundering voice
quick get off that bed you lazy thing will you never do anything
the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver
do you hear me repeated her father i tell you to break a pane
the child with a sort of terrified obedience rose on tiptoe and
struck a pane with her fist the glass broke and fell with a loud
he was grave and abrupt his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies
of the garret one would have said that he was a general making the
final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of
the mother who had not said a word so far now rose and demanded in
a dull slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a
what do you mean to do my dear
his intonation admitted of no deliberation the mother obeyed and threw
in the meantime a sob became audible in one corner
the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist without quitting the
corner in which she was cowering she had wounded herself while breaking
the window she went off near her mothers pallet and wept silently
it was now the mothers turn to start up and exclaim
just see there what follies you commit she has cut herself breaking
so much the better said the man i foresaw that
what so much the better retorted his wife
peace replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press
then tearing the womans chemise which he was wearing he made a strip
of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girls bleeding wrist
that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise
and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance
an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room the
outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet
of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers through the broken pane
the snow could be seen falling the snow promised by the candlemas sun
the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had
forgotten nothing he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet
brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them
then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney piece
now said he we can receive the philanthropist
chapter viii the ray of light in the hovel
the big girl approached and laid her hand in her fathers
bah replied the father i am much colder than that
you always have something better than any one else so you do even bad
the mother being eyed after a certain fashion held her tongue
silence reigned for a moment in the hovel the elder girl was removing
the mud from the bottom of her mantle with a careless air her younger
sister continued to sob the mother had taken the latters head between
her hands and was covering it with kisses whispering to her the
my treasure i entreat you it is nothing of consequence dont cry
no exclaimed the father quite the contrary sob sob thats
there now he is not coming what if he were not to come i shall have
extinguished my fire wrecked my chair torn my shirt and broken my
do you know went on the father that its beastly cold in this
devils garret what if that man should not come oh see there you he
makes us wait he says to himself well they will wait for me
thats what theyre there for oh how i hate them and with what joy
jubilation enthusiasm and satisfaction i could strangle all those rich
folks all those rich folks these men who pretend to be charitable
who put on airs who go to mass who make presents to the priesthood
preachy preachy in their skullcaps and who think themselves above
us and who come for the purpose of humiliating us and to bring us
clothes as they say old duds that are not worth four sous and
bread thats not what i want pack of rascals that they are its
money ah money never because they say that we would go off and drink
it up and that we are drunkards and idlers and they what are they
then and what have they been in their time thieves they never could
have become rich otherwise oh society ought to be grasped by the four
corners of the cloth and tossed into the air all of it it would all
be smashed very likely but at least no one would have anything
and there would be that much gained but what is that blockhead of
a benevolent gentleman doing will he come perhaps the animal has
forgotten the address ill bet that that old beast 
at that moment there came a light tap at the door the man rushed to it
and opened it exclaiming amid profound bows and smiles of adoration
enter sir deign to enter most respected benefactor and your
a man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the
marius had not quitted his post his feelings for the moment surpassed
whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those
it was certainly she marius could hardly distinguish her through the
luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes it was that
sweet absent being that star which had beamed upon him for six months
it was those eyes that brow that mouth that lovely vanished face
which had created night by its departure the vision had been eclipsed
it reappeared in that gloom in that garret in that misshapen attic in
marius shuddered in dismay what it was she the palpitations of his
heart troubled his sight he felt that he was on the brink of bursting
into tears what he beheld her again at last after having sought her
so long it seemed to him that he had lost his soul and that he had
she was the same as ever only a little pale her delicate face was
framed in a bonnet of violet velvet her figure was concealed beneath
a pelisse of black satin beneath her long dress a glimpse could be
caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot
she had taken a few steps into the room and had deposited a tolerably
the eldest jondrette girl had retired behind the door and was staring
with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet that silk mantle and that
the hovel was so dark that people coming from without felt on entering
it the effect produced on entering a cellar the two new comers
advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able
to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be
clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the
m leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to
monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some
our angelic benefactor overwhelms us said jondrette bowing to the
then bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter while the two
visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in
hey what did i say duds no money they are all alike by the way
how was the letter to that old blockhead signed
it was lucky for jondrette that this had occurred to him for at the
very moment m leblanc turned to him and said to him with the air of a
person who is seeking to recall a name
i see that you are greatly to be pitied monsieur 
monsieur fabantou yes that is it i remember
dramatic artist sir and one who has had some success
here jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the
philanthropist he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same
time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs and the humility of
a pupil of talma sir i am a pupil of talma fortune formerly smiled
on me alas now it is misfortunes turn you see my benefactor no
bread no fire my poor babes have no fire my only chair has no seat a
broken pane and in such weather my spouse in bed ill
the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to
contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob
cry bawl said jondrette to her in a low voice
at the same time he pinched her sore hand all this was done with the
the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks
the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his ursule
you see my beautiful young lady pursued jondrette her bleeding
wrist it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn
six sous a day it may be necessary to cut off her arm
the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently
for several minutes jondrette had been scrutinizing the benefactor
in a singular fashion as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other
attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections all at
once profiting by a moment when the new comers were questioning the
child with interest as to her injured hand he passed near his wife
who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to her in a
then turning to m leblanc and continuing his lamentations
you see sir all the clothing that i have is my wifes chemise and
all torn at that in the depths of winter i cant go out for lack of a
coat if i had a coat of any sort i would go and see mademoiselle mars
who knows me and is very fond of me does she not still reside in the
rue de la tour des dames do you know sir we played together in the
provinces i shared her laurels celimene would come to my succor sir
elmire would bestow alms on belisaire but no nothing and not a sou in
the house my wife ill and not a sou my daughter dangerously injured
not a sou my wife suffers from fits of suffocation it comes from her
age and besides her nervous system is affected she ought to have
assistance and my daughter also but the doctor but the apothecary
how am i to pay them i would kneel to a penny sir such is the
condition to which the arts are reduced and do you know my charming
young lady and you my generous protector do you know you who breathe
forth virtue and goodness and who perfume that church where my daughter
sees you every day when she says her prayers for i have brought up my
children religiously sir i did not want them to take to the theatre
ah the hussies if i catch them tripping i do not jest that i dont
i read them lessons on honor on morality on virtue ask them they
have got to walk straight they are none of your unhappy wretches who
begin by having no family and end by espousing the public one is
mamselle nobody and one becomes madame everybody deuce take it none
of that in the fabantou family i mean to bring them up virtuously and
they shall be honest and nice and believe in god by the sacred name
well sir my worthy sir do you know what is going to happen to morrow
to morrow is the fourth day of february the fatal day the last day of
grace allowed me by my landlord if by this evening i have not paid my
rent to morrow my oldest daughter my spouse with her fever my child
with her wound we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into
the street on the boulevard without shelter in the rain in the snow
there sir i owe for four quarters a whole year that is to say sixty
jondrette lied four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs
and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since
m leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table
jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter
the scoundrel what does he think i can do with his five francs
that wont pay me for my chair and pane of glass thats what comes of
in the meanwhile m leblanc had removed the large brown great coat
which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the
monsieur fabantou he said these five francs are all that i have
about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this
evening it is this evening that you must pay is it not
jondrettes face lighted up with a strange expression he replied
yes respected sir at eight oclock i must be at my landlords
i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty francs
my benefactor exclaimed jondrette overwhelmed and he added in a
low tone take a good look at him wife
m leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had
farewell until this evening my friends said he
at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the
you are forgetting your coat sir said she
jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a
m leblanc turned back and said with a smile
i have not forgotten it i am leaving it
o my protector said jondrette my august benefactor i melt into
tears permit me to accompany you to your carriage
if you come out answered m leblanc put on this coat it really is
jondrette did not need to be told twice he hastily donned the brown
great coat and all three went out jondrette preceding the two
chapter x tariff of licensed cabs two francs an hour
marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had
seen nothing his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart
had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of
her very first step in that garret during her entire stay there he
had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and
precipitates the whole soul on a single point he contemplated not that
girl but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet the
star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any
while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the
clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the
little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought
to catch her words he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form
her walk he did not know the sound of her voice he had once fancied
that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not
absolutely sure of the fact he would have given ten years of his life
to hear it in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of
that music but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations
and trumpet bursts of jondrette this added a touch of genuine wrath
to marius ecstasy he devoured her with his eyes he could not believe
that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of
those vile creatures in that monstrous lair it seemed to him that he
beheld a humming bird in the midst of toads
when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to
cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she
lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously
re discovered her he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat
as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of
opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause the corridor was
long the staircase steep jondrette was talkative m leblanc had
no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the
corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius
in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to
escape from him again and this time it would be final what was he
to do should he wait a little but while he was waiting the carriage
might drive off marius was perplexed at last he accepted the risk and
there was no one in the corridor he hastened to the stairs there was
no one on the staircase he descended in all haste and reached the
boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du
petit banquier on its way back to paris
marius rushed headlong in that direction on arriving at the angle of
the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending
the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there
was no means of overtaking it what run after it impossible and
besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual
running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would
recognize him at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck
marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard there was but
one thing to be done to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre that
marius made the driver a sign to halt and called to him
marius wore no cravat he had on his working coat which was destitute
of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom
the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing
marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him
