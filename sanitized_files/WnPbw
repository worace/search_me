good said murat and turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite
ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates
the guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advanced
up the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street they
halted and drew in the square several french officers superintended the
placing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glasses
the bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers and this sound
troubled the french they imagined it to be a call to arms a few
infantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate beams and wooden screens had been
put there and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing by
the guns shouted some words of command to the officer and the latter
the sound of three more shots came from the gate
one shot struck a french soldiers foot and from behind the screens
came the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a word
of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the
french general officers and men changed to one of determined
concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the
marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenka
mokhavaya or kutafyev street nor the troitsa gate places familiar in
moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary
and all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased the
guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks
and an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistling
sounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against the
stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and two
wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square
a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone
built kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their
head thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air
cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came a
solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the
figure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat he grasped a musket and
took aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and the
reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously
nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers
and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and
four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall
clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the
corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw
who these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was said
of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that
they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to
their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having
supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired the
wretches at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin was
murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the
gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of the
windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square
other detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along the
moroseyka the lubyanka and pokrovka streets others quartered
themselves along the vozdvizhenka the nikolski and the tverskoy
streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were
not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their
original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it
was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it
remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their
different lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began to
disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost
forever and there came into being something nondescript neither
citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weeks
later these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army they
were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles which
seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left
moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep
what he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
neck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
fist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the
french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they
carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go
of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow
district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms
and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and
walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were
busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
coach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
and baking bread with rolled up sleeves and cooking or frightening
amusing or caressing women and children there were many such men both
in the shops and houses but there was no army
order after order was issued by the french commanders that day
forbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any
violence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll call
for that very evening but despite all these measures the men who had
till then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy deserted
city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd of
cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out of
hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich
pastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city
no residents were left in moscow and the soldiers like water
percolating through sand spread irresistibly through the city in all
directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched the
cavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned and
finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on
all the same to the next house which seemed to them better many of
them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and
quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had
had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see
the city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed to
places where valuables were to be had for the taking the officers
followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
the same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops and
generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves
the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered
there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around
the quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexplored
and unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be found
and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water is
spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
mud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the
rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction
of both the army and the wealthy city
the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce de
rostopchine  the russians to the barbarity of the french in reality
however it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning
of moscow by making any individual or any group of people responsible
for it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
any town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether it
had or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines deserted
moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
which sparks continually fall for several days a town built of wood
where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners
are in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning when
its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke
pipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square and
cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to
billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in
that district immediately increases how much then must the probability
of fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troops
are quartered le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine and the barbarity
of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire by
the soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of
enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was any
arson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn the
houses in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arson
cannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happened
however tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchins
ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later on
to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is
impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the
fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house must
burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to
live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it
is true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like
berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants
abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor
the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did
only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the
after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances
pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed
by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought had
taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past
understood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared to
he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demands
that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable to
unravel he had gone to joseph alexeevichs house on the plea of
sorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest from
lifes turmoil for in his mind the memory of joseph alexeevich was
connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quite
contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
drawn he sought a quiet refuge and in joseph alexeevichs study he
really found it when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table
in the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memories
of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination
particularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of his
own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity
and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they when
gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected and
with that object he had asked gerasim to get him a peasants coat and a
pistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph
alexeevichs house and keeping his name secret then during the first
day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix his
attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the idea
that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of
his name in connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presented
itself but the idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set a
limit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
often passed through his mind and left no trace behind
when having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
the people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostovs and
natasha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendid
the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing
even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he was
next day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
any way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate but when he
returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended he
suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain in
moscow concealing his name and must meet napoleon and kill him and
either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe which it seemed
pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in 1809
by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot
and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose
the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in
view of the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to go
to mozhaysk on the twenty fifth and to make his way to the very thick of
the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and in
place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep on
a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gerasim the
other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt for
everything conventional artificial and human for everything the
majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierre had
first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the sloboda
palace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and life all that
men so painstakingly acquire and guard if it has any worth has so only
by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced
it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
penny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
an ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personal
power and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhuman
from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time
at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its influence but
only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierre
was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
had already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow like
everyone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and
his announcement to the rostovs that he would remain in moscow would all
become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and to
pierres physical condition as is always the case corresponded to his
mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank during
those days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linen
two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding all
this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity
it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already entered
moscow pierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought about
his undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind in his
fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness and
melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance
yes alone for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought
yes i will approach and then suddenly with pistol or dagger but
that is all the same it is not i but the hand of providence that
punishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would say
when killing napoleon well then take me and execute me he went on
speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression
while pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himself
in this way the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the
figure of makar alexeevich always so timid before but now quite
his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he was
obviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first but
noticing embarrassment on pierres face immediately grew bold and
staggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of the room
theyre frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i say i
wont surrender i say am i not right sir
he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor
gerasim and the porter who had followed makar alexeevich stopped him
in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre coming
out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the half crazy
old man makar alexeevich frowning with exertion held on to the pistol
and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his head
to arms board them no you shant get it he yelled
that will do please that will do have the goodness please sir to
let go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to steer makar
alexeevich by the elbows back to the door
thats not right sir come to your room please and rest allow me to
be off thou base slave touch me not see this shouted makar
they seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door
the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
suddenly a fresh sound a piercing feminine scream reverberated from
the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule
its them gracious heavens o lord four of them horsemen she
gerasim and the porter let makar alexeevich go and in the now silent
corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be
pierre having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french stood at the
half open door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as soon as
the french entered but the french entered and still pierre did not
there were two of them one was an officer a tall soldierly handsome
man the other evidently a private or an orderly sunburned short and
thin with sunken cheeks and a dull expression the officer walked in
front leaning on a stick and slightly limping when he had advanced a
few steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were good
quarters turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance and in
a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses having done
that the officer lifting his elbow with a smart gesture stroked his
bonjour la compagnie  said he gaily smiling and looking about him
vous etes le bourgeois  the officer asked gerasim
gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look
quartier quartier logement said the officer looking down at the
little man with a condescending and good natured smile les francais
sont de bons enfants que diable voyons ne nous fachons pas mon
vieux  added he clapping the scared and silent gerasim on the
shoulder well does no one speak french in this establishment he
asked again in french looking around and meeting pierres eyes pierre
 quarters quarters lodgings the french are good fellows what the
devil there dont let us be cross old fellow
again the officer turned to gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms
master not here dont understand me you said gerasim trying
to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them
still smiling the french officer spread out his hands before gerasims
nose intimating that he did not understand him either and moved
limping to the door at which pierre was standing pierre wished to go
away and conceal himself but at that moment he saw makar alexeevich
appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with a
madmans cunning makar alexeevich eyed the frenchman raised his
board them yelled the tipsy man trying to press the trigger hearing
the yell the officer turned round and at the same moment pierre threw
himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up the
pistol makar alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger there
was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke the
frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door
forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of french pierre
snatching away the pistol and throwing it down ran up to the officer
i think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i have
had a lucky escape this time he added pointing to the damaged plaster
of the wall who is that man said he looking sternly at pierre
oh i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly
quite forgetting the part he had intended to play he is an unfortunate
madman who did not know what he was doing
the officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the collar
makar alexeevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about to
fall asleep as he leaned against the wall
brigand you shall pay for this said the frenchman letting go of
him we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon
traitors he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
pierre continued in french to persuade the officer not to hold that
drunken imbecile to account the frenchman listened in silence with the
same gloomy expression but suddenly turned to pierre with a smile for
a few seconds he looked at him in silence his handsome face assumed a
melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand
you have saved my life you are french said he
for a frenchman that deduction was indubitable only a frenchman could
perform a great deed and to save his life the life of m ramballe
captain of the 13th light regiment was undoubtedly a very great deed
but however indubitable that conclusion and the officers conviction
based upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him
tut tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving his
finger before his nose and smiling you shall tell me all about that
presently i am delighted to meet a compatriot well and what are we to
do with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as to a
even if pierre were not a frenchman having once received that loftiest
of human appellations he could not renounce it said the officers look
and tone in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makar
alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile
had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from
him and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished
the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
you have saved my life you are french you ask his pardon i grant it
you lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and taking
the arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving his
life he went with him into the room
the soldiers in the yard hearing the shot came into the passage asking
what had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits
you will be called in when you are wanted he said
the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had time
to visit the kitchen came up to his officer
captain there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said he
when the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter again
thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and wished to
go away but the officer would not hear of it he was so very polite
amiable good natured and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving his
life that pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him in
the parlor the first room they entered to pierres assurances that he
was not a frenchman the captain evidently not understanding how anyone
could decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders and
said that if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let it
be so but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude
had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
feelings of others and had he at all understood what pierres feelings
were the latter would probably have left him but the mans animated
obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre
a frenchman or a russian prince incognito said the officer looking
at pierres fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger i
owe my life to you and offer you my friendship a frenchman never
forgets either an insult or a service i offer you my friendship that
there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of the
word in the officers voice in the expression of his face and in his
gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the
frenchmans smile pressed the hand held out to him
captain ramballe of the 13th light regiment chevalier of the legion
of honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introduced
himself a self satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
his mustache will you now be so good as to tell me with whom i have
the honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being in the ambulance
pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and blushing began
to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
concealing it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him
oh please said he i understand your reasons you are an officer
a superior officer perhaps you have borne arms against us thats not
my business i owe you my life that is enough for me i am quite at
your service you belong to the gentry he concluded with a shade of
inquiry in his tone pierre bent his head your baptismal name if you
please that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say thats all i
when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
brought with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellar
and brought with them ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner and
himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man
munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth continually smacking
his lips and repeating excellent delicious his face grew red and
was covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
with pleasure morel the orderly brought some hot water in a saucepan
and placed a bottle of claret in it he also brought a bottle of kvass
taken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage was already known
to the french and had been given a special name they called it limonade
de cochon pigs lemonade and morel spoke well of the limonade de
cochon he had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they
had taken while passing through moscow he left the kvass to morel and
applied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to
its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner
yes my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for saving
me from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my body
already here is one i got at wagram he touched his side and a
second at smolensk he showed a scar on his cheek and this leg which
as you see does not want to march i got that on the seventh at the
great battle of la moskowa sacre dieu it was splendid that deluge of
fire was worth seeing it was a tough job you set us there my word you
may be proud of it and on my honor in spite of the cough i caught
there i should be ready to begin again i pity those who did not see
bah really so much the better you are certainly brave foes the
great redoubt held out well by my pipe continued the frenchman and
you made us pay dear for it i was at it three times sure as i sit
here three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown
back like cardboard figures oh it was beautiful monsieur pierre your
grenadiers were splendid by heaven i saw them close up their ranks six
times in succession and march as if on parade fine fellows our king of
naples who knows whats what cried bravo ha ha so you are one of
us soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause so much the
better so much the better monsieur pierre terrible in battle
gallant with the fair he winked and smiled thats what the
the captain was so naively and good humoredly gay so real and so
pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
at him probably the word gallant turned the captains thoughts to the
apropos tell me please is it true that the women have all left
moscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of
would not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered it
ha ha ha the frenchman emitted a merry sanguine chuckle patting
pierre on the shoulder what a thing to say he exclaimed paris
paris the capital of the world pierre finished his remark for him
the captain looked at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in the
middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing kindly eyes
well if you hadnt told me you were russian i should have wagered
that you were parisian you have that i dont know what that and
having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence
i have been in paris i spent years there said pierre
oh yes one sees that plainly paris a man who doesnt know paris
is a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is talma la
duchenois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and noticing that his
conclusion was weaker than what had gone before he added quickly
there is only one paris in the world you have been to paris and have
remained russian well i dont esteem you the less for it
under the influence of the wine he had drunk and after the days he had
spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyed
talking with this cheerful and good natured man
to return to your ladies i hear they are lovely what a wretched idea
to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is in
moscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants now
thats another thing but you civilized people you ought to know us
better than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome warsaw
all the worlds capitals we are feared but we are loved we are
nice to know and then the emperor he began but pierre interrupted
the emperor pierre repeated and his face suddenly became sad and
the emperor he is generosity mercy justice order genius thats
what the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i assure you
i was his enemy eight years ago my father was an emigrant count but
that man has vanquished me he has taken hold of me i could not resist
the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered france
when i understood what he wanted when i saw that he was preparing a bed
of laurels for us you know i said to myself that is a monarch and
i devoted myself to him so there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest
is he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look
the frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled
no he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and continued his
their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the
gate and by morel who came to say that some wurttemberg hussars had
come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captains
horses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
not understand what was said to them in french
the captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voice
asked him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officer
and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
occupied the german who knew little french answered the two first
questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
officer but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
said introducing broken french into his own german that he was the
quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
occupy all the houses one after another pierre who knew german
translated what the german said to the captain and gave the captains
reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had understood what
was said to him the german submitted and took his men elsewhere the
captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice
when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place as
before with his head in his hands his face expressed suffering he
really was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and he
was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he
was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happy
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as that
was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment he was
tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the few glasses of
wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good natured man had
destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
few days and which was essential for the execution of his design the
pistol dagger and peasant coat were ready napoleon was to enter the
town next day pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
worthy action to slay the evildoer but now he felt that he would not do
it he did not know why but he felt a foreboding that he would not
carry out his intention he struggled against the confession of his
weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
former gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and self
sacrifice had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he
the captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tune
the frenchmans chatter which had previously amused pierre now repelled
him the tune he was whistling his gait and the gesture with which he
twirled his mustache all now seemed offensive i will go away
immediately i wont say another word to him thought pierre he
thought this but still sat in the same place a strange feeling of
weakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away but
the captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up and
down the room twice his eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
were smiling to himself at some amusing thought
the colonel of those wurttembergers is delightful he suddenly said
hes a german but a nice fellow all the same but hes a german
he sat down facing pierre by the way you know german then
shelter pierre repeated the german for shelter is unterkunft
how do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully
onterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with
laughing eyes these germans are first rate fools dont you think so
well lets have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux shall we
morel will warm us up another little bottle morel he called out
morel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked at pierre
by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
on his companions face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy in
his face went up to pierre and bent over him
there now were sad said he touching pierres hand have i upset
you no really have you anything against me he asked pierre
pierre did not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans eyes
whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him
honestly without speaking of what i owe you i feel friendship for
you can i do anything for you dispose of me it is for life and death
i say it with my hand on my heart said he striking his chest
the captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
shelter was unterkunft in german and his face suddenly brightened
well in that case i drink to our friendship he cried gaily filling
pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied his too
again pressed pierres hand and leaned his elbows on the table in a
yes my dear friend he began such is fortunes caprice who would
have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
service of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscow
with him i must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad and
measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story that our name
is one of the most ancient in france
and with a frenchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told pierre
the story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and all
about his relations and his financial and family affairs ma pauvre
mere playing of course an important part in the story
but all that is only lifes setting the real thing is love love am i
not right monsieur pierre said he growing animated another glass
pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third
oh women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes at
pierre began talking of love and of his love affairs
there were very many of these as one could easily believe looking at
the officers handsome self satisfied face and noting the eager
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all ramballes love
stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special
charm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincere
conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with
it was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not
that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor was
it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
natasha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one he
considered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love of
principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling
thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
fascinating marquise of thirty five and at the same time for a charming
innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise the
conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in
the mothers sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
to her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory of
a distant past then he recounted an episode in which the husband played
the part of the lover and he the lover assumed the role of the
husband as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of
germany where shelter is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat
sauerkraut and the young girls are too blonde
finally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captains
memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face was
of how he had saved the life of a pole in general the saving of life
continually occurred in the captains stories and the pole had
entrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while himself
entering the french service the captain was happy the enchanting
polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity the
captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i have
saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the
captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away the
weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection
listening to the captains tales pierre as often happens late in the
evening and under the influence of wine followed all that was told him
understood it all and at the same time followed a train of personal
memories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind while
listening to these love stories his own love for natasha unexpectedly
rose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in his
imagination he mentally compared them with ramballes tales listening
to the story of the struggle between love and duty pierre saw before
his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
his love at the sukharev water tower at the time of that meeting it had
not produced an effect upon him he had not even once recalled it but
now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed to
hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes her
smile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and there
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this
having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady the captain
asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband
challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need to
express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that he
understood love for a women somewhat differently he said that in all
his life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she could
pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
years but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
young and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name
afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
her because he loved her too well placing her far above everything in
when he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether he
the captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
whether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or the
thought that this man did not and never would know any of those who
played a part in his story or whether it was all these things together
something loosened pierres tongue speaking thickly and with a faraway
look in his shining eyes he told the whole story of his life his
marriage natashas love for his best friend her betrayal of him and
all his own simple relations with her urged on by ramballes questions
he also told what he had at first concealed his own position and even
more than anything else in pierres story the captain was impressed by
the fact that pierre was very rich had two mansions in moscow and that
he had abandoned everything and not left the city but remained there
when it was late at night they went out together into the street the
night was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka a
fire glowed the first of those that were beginning in moscow to the
right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in pierres
heart with his love at the gate stood gerasim the cook and two
frenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
two languages could be heard they were looking at the glow seen in the
there was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the immense
gazing at the high starry sky at the moon at the comet and at the
glow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful emotion there now how
good it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly
remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
against the fence to save himself from falling
without taking leave of his new friend pierre left the gate with
unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
the glow of the first fire that began on the second of september was
watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by the
the rostov party spent the night at mytishchi fourteen miles from
moscow they had started so late on the first of september the road had
been so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had been
forgotten for which servants were sent back that they had decided to
spend that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next morning
they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
as great mytishchi at ten oclock that evening the rostov family and
the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
huts of that large village the rostovs servants and coachmen and the
orderlies of the wounded officers after attending to their masters had
supper fed the horses and came out into the porches
in a neighboring hut lay raevskis adjutant with a fractured wrist the
awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously and his
moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night he had
spent the first night in the same yard as the rostovs the countess said
she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning and at
mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
in the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed above the high
body of a coach standing before the porch the small glow of another
fire one glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was
little mytishchi burning set on fire by mamonovs cossacks
but look here brothers theres another fire remarked an orderly
but they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by mamonovs
two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down
its more to the left why little mytishchi is over there and this is
see how its flaring said one thats a fire in moscow either in
no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently
at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance
old daniel terentich the counts valet as he was called came up to
what are you staring at you good for nothing the count will be

i only ran out to get some water said mishka
but what do you think daniel terentich doesnt it look as if that

silent the glow spread rising and falling farther and farther still

and it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
significance for them of the glow they were watching sighs were heard
