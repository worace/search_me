sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came
to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his
administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a
master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was
not to be trifled with either in a word he was a real master
one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas and
that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making
free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this
but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a man
who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of
dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porch
to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies
the sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholas
went up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
morning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countess
mary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed and
lips compressed and gave her husband no reply
such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mere
recollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not see
but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked
countess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily looked
the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in
tears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow or
pity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm
the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and
nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced up
and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could
not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from
childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just
sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himself
before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
love and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
mary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again i
give you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
the tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his hand
nicholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change the
subject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
today it was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it and
again he flushed i give you my word of honor it shant occur again
and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the broken
after that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the
blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas would
turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the
man who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twice
within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife and
would again promise that this should really be the very last time
mary you must despise me he would say i deserve it
you should go go away at once if you dont feel strong enough to
control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband
among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked
he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class and
consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the
whole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the work
on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same
business like seriousness leaving home for a month or even two with
his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time
reading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these he
spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a serious
library and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought
he would sit in his study with a grave air reading a task he first
imposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habit
affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being
occupied with serious matters in winter except for business
excursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one with
his family and entering into all the details of his childrens relations
with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and
closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her
from the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house before that
nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and
sonya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to
be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he
had done sonya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that her
wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault with
sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt ill will
once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about her
you know said natasha you have read the gospels a great deal there
is a passage in them that just fits sonya
to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be
taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i dont know
perhaps she lacks egotism i dont know but from her is taken away and
everything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her
formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her but i always had a
sort of presentiment that it would not come off she is a sterile
flower you know like some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry
for her and sometimes i think she doesnt feel it as you or i would
though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must be
understood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with natashas
explanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her position
trying and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower
she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the people but to the
home she waited on the old countess petted and spoiled the children
was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift
and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient
the country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt though not on the same
the buildings begun under straitened circumstances were more than
simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood
plastered only inside it had bare deal floors and was furnished with
very simple hard sofas armchairs tables and chairs made by their own
serf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was spacious and
had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors whole
families of the rostovs and bolkonskis relations sometimes came to
bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
months besides that four times a year on the name days and birthdays
of the hosts as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day
or two the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its
ordinary occupations and its breakfasts lunches dinners and suppers
provided out of the produce of the estate
it was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december 1820 natasha had
been staying at her brothers with her husband and children since early
autumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three
weeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
besides the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the retired general
vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of
on the sixth which was his name day when the house would be full of
visitors nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a
tail coat and put on narrow boots with pointed toes and drive to the
new church he had built and then receive visitors who would come to
congratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the elections
of the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of
that day in his usual way he examined the bailiffs accounts of the
village in ryazan which belonged to his wifes nephew wrote two
business letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards and
stables before dinner having taken precautions against the general
drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saints
day he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talk
with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons at
which the whole household had assembled at that table were his mother
his mothers old lady companion belova his wife their three children
with their governess and tutor his wifes nephew with his tutor sonya
denisov natasha her three children their governess and old michael
ivanovich the late princes architect who was living on in retirement
countess mary sat at the other end of the table when her husband took
his place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking up
his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing
before him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the case when he
came in to dinner straight from the farm especially before the soup
countess mary well knew that mood of his and when she herself was in a
good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
ill humor but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
be angry with her without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked
him where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everything
was going well on the farm her unnatural tone made him wince
then im not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross with
me she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished
to end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded unnatural but
could not refrain from asking some more questions
thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and
lively and she did not talk to her husband when they left the table
and went as usual to thank the old countess countess mary held out her
hand and kissed her husband and asked him why he was angry with her
you always have such strange fancies i didnt even think of being
but the word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i wont
nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the
old countess who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree
could find nothing to reproach them with but even they had their
moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after they
had been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement
and hostility which occurred most frequently during countess marys
well messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparent
cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to
vex her i have been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow i
shall have to suffer so today ill go and rest
and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
thats always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyone
except me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when i
am in this condition she looked down at her expanded figure and in the
glass at her pale sallow emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
and everything annoyed her denisovs shouting and laughter natashas
talk and especially a quick glance sonya gave her
sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling
having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
what they were saying she softly left the room and went to the nursery
the children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made of
chairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with
them a little but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
crossness worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe with
perhaps he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she said
to herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his mother
followed her on tiptoe she did not notice him
mary dear i think he is asleep he was so tired said sonya meeting
her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that she
crossed her path everywhere andrew may wake him
countess mary looked round saw little andrew following her felt that
sonya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evident
difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made no reply but
to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went
to the door sonya went away by another door from the room in which
nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing every
slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife as she listened to it
she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead his mustache and his
whole face as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night
when he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat and at
that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door papa mammas
standing here countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to
the boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible to
countess mary she knew how nicholas disliked being waked then through
the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring and
i cant get a moments peace mary is that you why did you bring
i only came in to look and did not notice forgive me
nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the
door and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little
black eyed three year old natasha her fathers pet having learned from
her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room ran
to her father unobserved by her mother the dark eyed little girl boldly
opened the creaking door went up to the sofa with energetic steps of
her sturdy little legs and having examined the position of her father
who was asleep with his back to her rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
which lay under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on his
natasha natasha came countess marys frightened whisper from the
no mamma he doesnt want to sleep said little natasha with
nicholas lowered his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms
come in mary he said to his wife
she went in and sat down by her husband
i did not notice him following me she said timidly i just looked
holding his little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at his wife and
seeing her guilty expression put his other arm around her and kissed
again she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
i dont know why you think i am cross said nicholas replying to the
question he knew was in his wifes mind
you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are like
mary dont talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he
it seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain always
oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears its love that
makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are
loved for their beauty but do i love my wife i dont love her but
i dont know how to put it without you or when something comes between
us like this i seem lost and cant do anything now do i love my
finger i dont love it but just try to cut it off
im not like that myself but i understand so youre not angry with
awfully angry he said smiling and getting up and smoothing his hair
do you know mary what ive been thinking he began immediately
thinking aloud in his wifes presence now that they had made it up
he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a
thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he told
her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring
countess mary listened till he had finished made some remark and in
her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the children
you can see the woman in her already she said in french pointing to
little natasha you reproach us women with being illogical here is our
logic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no hes laughing
and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile
yes yes and nicholas taking his little daughter in his strong hand
lifted her high placed her on his shoulder held her by the legs and
paced the room with her there was an expression of carefree happiness
on the faces of both father and daughter
but you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one his wife
yes but what am i to do i try not to show
at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
the hall and anteroom as if someone had arrived
i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and left
in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
gallop round the room out of breath he took the laughing child quickly
from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart his capers reminded him
of dancing and looking at the childs round happy little face he
thought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking her
into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
it is he it is he nicholas said countess mary re entering the room
a few minutes later now our natasha has come to life you should have
seen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so long
well come along now quick quick its time you two were parted she
added looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father
nicholas went out holding the child by the hand
i should never never have believed that one could be so happy she
whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she
sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt
through her happiness that there is another sort of happiness
unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
natasha had married in the early spring of 1813 and in 1820 already had
three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was
now nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficult
to recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natasha of
former days her features were more defined and had a calm soft and
serene expression in her face there was none of the ever glowing
animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm now
her face and body were often all that one saw and her soul was not
visible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and
fertile woman the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now that
happened only when as was the case that day her husband returned home
or a sick child was convalescent or when she and countess mary spoke of
prince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imagined
was jealous of prince andrews memory or on the rare occasions when
something happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quite
abandoned since her marriage at the rare moments when the old fire did
kindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even more
since their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow in
petersburg on their estate near moscow or with her mother that is to
say in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often seen
in society and those who met her there were not pleased with her and
found her neither attractive nor amiable not that natasha liked
solitude she did not know whether she liked it or not she even thought
that she did not but with her pregnancies her confinements the
nursing of her children and sharing every moment of her husbands life
she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing
society all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at the
change in her as at something extraordinary only the old countess with
her maternal instinct had realized that all natashas outbursts had been
due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had once
exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother
was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never
understood natasha and she kept saying that she had always known that
natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother
only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
bounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurd
natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk
especially by the french which says that a girl should not let herself
go when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should be
even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried and
should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her
husband natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery
of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part she gave it up
just because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pains with her
manners or with delicacy of speech or with her toilet or to show
herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoid
inconveniencing him by being too exacting she acted in contradiction to
all those rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her
husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
entirely that is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hidden
from him she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by
the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by something
else indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul
to fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic
songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn
herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps
have been agreeable she did not know but she had no time at all for
it the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress
or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for
we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a
subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so
trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entire
the subject which wholly engrossed natashas attention was her family
that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
entirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear
bring into the world nurse and bring up
and the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her whole
soul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the larger
did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary
there were then as now conversations and discussions about womens
rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights
though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now but
these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha she positively
these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing in
marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is
only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance which
discussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of
how to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not then
and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the
nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family
if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats two
dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners
if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have
many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that
if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for
the family that is one wife or one husband natasha needed a husband
a husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only saw
no need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of her
soul were intent on serving that husband and family she could not
imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
natasha did not care for society in general but prized the more the
society of her relatives countess mary and her brother her mother
and sonya she valued the company of those to whom she could come
striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and with
joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys napkin and
from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was
to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressed
and did her hair her ill chosen words and her jealousy she was
jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plain
were habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinion
was that pierre was under his wifes thumb which was really true from
the very first days of their married life natasha had announced her
demands pierre was greatly surprised by his wifes view to him a
perfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her and
to the family his wifes demands astonished him but they also
pierres subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
flirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman did
not dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money on a
whim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on
business in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits which
she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great
importance to make up for this at home pierre had the right to
regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose at
home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband
and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied that is
was reading or writing in his study pierre had but to show a partiality
for anything to get just what he liked done always he had only to
express a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it
the entire household was governed according to pierres supposed orders
that is by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way of life
and place of residence their acquaintances and ties natashas
occupations the childrens upbringing were all selected not merely
with regard to pierres expressed wishes but to what natasha from the
thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be and she
deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having once
arrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to
change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons
thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their
first child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nurse
three times and natasha fell ill from despair pierre one day told her
of rousseaus view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurse
is unnatural and harmful when her next baby was born despite the
opposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband himself
who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself a thing
then unheard of and considered injurious she insisted on having her own
way and after that nursed all her babies herself
it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
would have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and
delight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the very thought
against which she had argued but divested of everything superfluous
that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm
consciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he saw
himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himself
inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in
him was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejected
and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs
he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come to
petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal
on reading that letter she always read her husbands letters natasha
herself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would feel
his absence very acutely she attributed immense importance to all her
husbands intellectual and abstract interests though she did not
understand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such
matters to pierres timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
replied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his return
he was given four weeks leave of absence
ever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnight
before natasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression and
denisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
the present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight he
looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
person once dear a dull dejected look random replies and talk about
the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress
natasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her mother
her brother sonya or countess mary in their efforts to console her
tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning
its all nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to nothing
and all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very affairs
in the immense importance of which she firmly believed
and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one
else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
little three month old creature when he lay at her breast and she was
conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little
nose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you would
like to pay him out you are afraid but here am i and i am he and
that was unanswerable it was more than true
during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for
comfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him and
he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was just
what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was heard at
the front door and the old nurse knowing how to please her mistress
entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face
has he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move lest
the blood rushed to natashas face and her feet involuntarily moved but
she could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his eyes and
looked at her youre here he seemed to be saying and again lazily
cautiously withdrawing her breast natasha rocked him a little handed
him to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the door but at the
door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her
joy left the child too soon and she glanced round the nurse with
raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot
go maam dont worry go she whispered smiling with the kind of
familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress
natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom
denisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his
pipe now for the first time recognized the old natasha a flood of
brilliant joyful light poured from her transfigured face
hes come she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he too
was delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had returned
on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
unwinding his scarf its he its really he he has come she said to
herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head to her
breast and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy happy face
covered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contented
then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
experienced for the last fortnight and the joy that had lit up her face
vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of
yes its all very well for you you are pleased youve had a good
time but what about me you might at least have shown consideration
for the children i am nursing and my milk was spoiled petya was at
deaths door but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoying
pierre knew he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner he
knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two
above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted to
smile but dared not even think of doing so he made a piteous
i could not on my honor but how is petya
all right now come along i wonder youre not ashamed if only you
could see what i was like without you how i suffered
come come she said not letting go of his arm and they went to
when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery
holding his baby son who was again awake on his huge right palm and
dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the babys broad face
with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and there
was bright joyous sunshine on natashas face as she gazed tenderly at
and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore she
you see he holds it up she meant the babys head but how he did
frighten me youve seen the princess is it true shes in love with
at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the baby
on his hand stooped kissed them and replied to their inquiries but in
spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the baby
with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
how sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby
now nicholas she added turning to her husband i cant understand
how it is you dont see the charm of these delicious marvels
i dont and cant replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby a
and yet hes such an affectionate father said countess mary
vindicating her husband but only after they are a year old or so
now pierre nurses them splendidly said natasha he says his hand is
just made for a babys seat just look
only not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh and
shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse
as in every large household there were at bald hills several perfectly
distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though each
retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others every
event joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to all
these worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
for instance pierres return was a joyful and important event and they
the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they
judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
acts and way of life were glad of pierres return because they knew
that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day to
attend to the estate and would be in better spirits and temper and
also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays
the children and their governesses were glad of pierres return because
no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did
he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece to
which as he said all possible dances could be danced and they felt
sure he had brought presents for them all
young nicholas now a slim lad of fifteen delicate and intelligent
with curly light brown hair and beautiful eyes was delighted because
uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and
passionate affection no one had instilled into him this love for pierre
whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up had
done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him and
little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him with just a shade of
contempt pierre however he adored he did not want to be an hussar or
a knight of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted to be learned
wise and kind like pierre in pierres presence his face always shone
with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to
him he did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwards
with dessalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning of
everything pierre had said pierres past life and his unhappiness prior
to 1812 of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from
some words he had overheard his adventures in moscow his captivity
platon karataev of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natasha
of whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially pierres
friendship with the father whom nicholas could not remember all this
made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint
from broken remarks about natasha and his father from the emotion with
which pierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverent
tenderness with which natasha spoke of him the boy who was only just
beginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father had
loved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend but the father
whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
tears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre had
the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
the grown up members of the family not to mention his wife were
pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them and
especially that natasha would now be herself again
pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
though the most absent minded and forgetful of men pierre with the aid
of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgetting
his mother and brother in laws commissions nor the dress material for
a present to belova nor toys for his wifes nephews in the early days
of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect
him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and he
had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he
forgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing that
natasha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for others
only when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found an
unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for
everyone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurred
natashas censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
things to her other defects as most people thought them but which to
pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she now
from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing
entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that he
spent only half as much as before and that his affairs which had been
in disorder of late chiefly because of his first wifes debts had
life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive
luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no
longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now
been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
his power and so that way of life proved economical
with a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases
what do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like a
natasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
thats for belova excellent she felt the quality of the material
it was a ruble an arshin i suppose
too dear natasha remarked how pleased the children will be and
mamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable to
suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls
of a kind then just coming into fashion
adele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierre
when am i to wear it and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair when
i take little masha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again
and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
the countess was sitting with her companion belova playing grand
patience as usual when pierre and natasha came into the drawing room
the countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with a
frill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper lip
had sunk in and her eyes were dim
after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession she
felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
without aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or kept
awake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wanted
nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death
could give her but until death came she had to go on living that is
to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children
and very old people was particularly evident in her her life had no
external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and
inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep
work give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had a
stomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things not
under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when
behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their
functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically
needed to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child does
because her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their
full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext
thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day
before she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end
it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur
and when belova replied oh yes theyve come she would mutter
angrily o lord how stupid and deaf she is
another pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp
or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her face
would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova
would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just
as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
her still existing faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a
game of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would be
the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health
would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the
pretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercise
which was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an after dinner
rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the same
stories over and over again to the same audience
the old ladys condition was understood by the whole household though no
one ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfy
her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between
nicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the common
but those glances expressed something more they said that she had
played her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole self
that we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield to
her to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
full of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied memento
only the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and the
little children failed to understand this and avoided her
when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in
one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
playing patience and so though by force of habit she greeted him with
the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an
absence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waiting
for you well thank god and received her presents with another
customary remark its not the gift thats precious my dear but that
you give it to me an old woman yet it was evident that she was not
pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it diverted her
she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents
they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a bright
blue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid
and a gold snuffbox with the counts portrait on the lid which pierre
had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long
wished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then she
glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to
thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she always
did but best of all you have brought yourself back for i never saw
anything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are we to
do with her she is like a mad woman when you are away doesnt see
anything doesnt remember anything she went on repeating her usual
phrases look anna timofeevna she added to her companion see what
a box for cards my son has brought us
belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material
though pierre natasha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much to
talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess not that
anything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so far
behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
repeat what they had already told her many times that so and so was
dead and so and so was married which she would again be unable to
remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
habit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether prince
vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings
and still thought of them and other matters that interested no one and
