the name of the cosmographer ptolemy and said he thou must know
sancho that with the spaniards and those who embark at cadiz for the
east indies one of the signs they have to show them when they have
passed the equinoctial line i told thee of is that the lice die upon
everybody on board the ship and not a single one is left or to be found
in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it so sancho
thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh and if thou comest upon
anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt if not then we have
i dont believe a bit of it said sancho still ill do as your
worship bids me though i dont know what need there is for trying these
experiments for i can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five
yards away from the bank or shifted two yards from where the animals
stand for there are rocinante and dapple in the very same place where we
left them and watching a point as i do now i swear by all thats good
we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant
try the test i told thee of sancho said don quixote and dont mind
any other for thou knowest nothing about colures lines parallels
bearings the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are
composed if thou wert acquainted with all these things or any portion
of them thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut what
signs we have seen and what constellations we have left behind and are
now leaving behind but again i tell thee feel and hunt for i am
certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper
sancho felt and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow
of his left knee he looked up at his master and said either the test
is a false one or we have not come to where your worship says nor
why how so asked don quixote hast thou come upon aught
ay and aughts replied sancho and shaking his fingers he washed his
whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in
midstream not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter
but simply by the current just there smooth and gentle
they now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle
of the river and the instant don quixote saw them he cried out seest
thou there my friend there stands the castle or fortress where there
is no doubt some knight in durance or ill used queen or infanta or
princess in whose aid i am brought hither
what the devil city fortress or castle is your worship talking about
senor said sancho dont you see that those are mills that stand in
hold thy peace sancho said don quixote though they look like mills
they are not so i have already told thee that enchantments transform
things and change their proper shapes i do not mean to say they really
change them from one form into another but that it seems as though they
did as experience proved in the transformation of dulcinea sole refuge
by this time the boat having reached the middle of the stream began to
move less slowly than hitherto the millers belonging to the mills when
they saw the boat coming down the river and on the point of being sucked
in by the draught of the wheels ran out in haste several of them with
long poles to stop it and being all mealy with faces and garments
covered with flour they presented a sinister appearance they raised
loud shouts crying devils of men where are you going to are you mad
do you want to drown yourselves or dash yourselves to pieces among these
did i not tell thee sancho said don quixote at this that we had
reached the place where i am to show what the might of my arm can do see
what ruffians and villains come out against me see what monsters oppose
me see what hideous countenances come to frighten us you shall soon
see scoundrels and then standing up in the boat he began in a loud
voice to hurl threats at the millers exclaiming ill conditioned and
worse counselled rabble restore to liberty and freedom the person ye
hold in durance in this your fortress or prison high or low or of
whatever rank or quality he be for i am don quixote of la mancha
otherwise called the knight of the lions for whom by the disposition of
heaven above it is reserved to give a happy issue to this adventure
and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in the air at the
millers who hearing but not understanding all this nonsense strove to
stop the boat which was now getting into the rushing channel of the
wheels sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to
deliver him from such imminent peril which it did by the activity and
quickness of the millers who pushing against the boat with their poles
stopped it not however without upsetting and throwing don quixote and
sancho into the water and lucky it was for don quixote that he could
swim like a goose though the weight of his armour carried him twice to
the bottom and had it not been for the millers who plunged in and
hoisted them both out it would have been troy town with the pair of
them as soon as more drenched than thirsty they were landed sancho
went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven
prayed a long and fervent prayer to god to deliver him evermore from the
rash projects and attempts of his master the fishermen the owners of
the boat which the mill wheels had knocked to pieces now came up and
seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip sancho and to demand payment
for it from don quixote but he with great calmness just as if nothing
had happened him told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for
the bark most cheerfully on condition that they delivered up to him
free and unhurt the person or persons that were in durance in that
what persons or what castle art thou talking of madman art thou for
carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills
thats enough said don quixote to himself it would be preaching in
the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any
virtuous action in this adventure two mighty enchanters must have
encountered one another and one frustrates what the other attempts one
provided the bark for me and the other upset me god help us this world
is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the other i
can do no more and then turning towards the mills he said aloud
friends whoeer ye be that are immured in that prison forgive me that
to my misfortune and yours i cannot deliver you from your misery this
adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight
so saying he settled with the fishermen and paid fifty reals for the
boat which sancho handed to them very much against the grain saying
with a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our
the fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two
figures so very different to all appearance from ordinary men and were
wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions don
quixote addressed to them and coming to the conclusion that they were
madmen they left them and betook themselves the millers to their mills
and the fishermen to their huts don quixote and sancho returned to their
beasts and to their life of beasts and so ended the adventure of the
of don quixotes adventure with a fair huntress
they reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough knight
and squire sancho particularly for with him what touched the stock of
money touched his heart and when any was taken from him he felt as if he
was robbed of the apples of his eyes in fine without exchanging a word
they mounted and quitted the famous river don quixote absorbed in
thoughts of his love sancho in thinking of his advancement which just
then it seemed to him he was very far from securing for fool as he
was he saw clearly enough that his masters acts were all or most of
them utterly senseless and he began to cast about for an opportunity of
retiring from his service and going home some day without entering into
any explanations or taking any farewell of him fortune however ordered
matters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated
it so happened that the next day towards sunset on coming out of a wood
don quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow and at the far end of it
observed some people and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking
party coming closer he distinguished among them a lady of graceful
mien on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings
and a silver mounted side saddle the lady was also in green and so
richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in
her on her left hand she bore a hawk a proof to don quixotes mind that
she must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party
which was the fact so he said to sancho run sancho my son and say to
that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that i the knight of the lions
kiss the hands of her exalted beauty and if her excellence will grant me
leave i will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her service
for aught that may be in my power and her highness may command and mind
sancho how thou speakest and take care not to thrust in any of thy
youve got a likely one here to thrust any in said sancho leave me
alone for that why this is not the first time in my life i have carried
except that thou didst carry to the lady dulcinea said don quixote i
know not that thou hast carried any other at least in my service
that is true replied sancho but pledges dont distress a good payer
and in a house where theres plenty supper is soon cooked i mean theres
no need of telling or warning me about anything for im ready for
that i believe sancho said don quixote go and good luck to thee
sancho went off at top speed forcing dapple out of his regular pace and
came to where the fair huntress was standing and dismounting knelt
before her and said fair lady that knight that you see there the
knight of the lions by name is my master and i am a squire of his and
at home they call me sancho panza this same knight of the lions who was
called not long since the knight of the rueful countenance sends by me
to say may it please your highness to give him leave that with your
permission approbation and consent he may come and carry out his
wishes which are as he says and i believe to serve your exalted
loftiness and beauty and if you give it your ladyship will do a thing
which will redound to your honour and he will receive a most
you have indeed squire said the lady delivered your message with
all the formalities such messages require rise up for it is not right
that the squire of a knight so great as he of the rueful countenance of
whom we have heard a great deal here should remain on his knees rise
my friend and bid your master welcome to the services of myself and the
duke my husband in a country house we have here
sancho got up charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her
high bred air and her courtesy but above all by what she had said
about having heard of his master the knight of the rueful countenance
for if she did not call him knight of the lions it was no doubt because
he had so lately taken the name tell me brother squire asked the
duchess whose title however is not known this master of yours is
he not one of whom there is a history extant in print called the
ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha who has for the lady of
he is the same senora replied sancho and that squire of his who
figures or ought to figure in the said history under the name of sancho
panza is myself unless they have changed me in the cradle i mean in
i am rejoiced at all this said the duchess go brother panza and
tell your master that he is welcome to my estate and that nothing could
happen me that could give me greater pleasure
sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying
answer and told him all the great lady had said to him lauding to the
skies in his rustic phrase her rare beauty her graceful gaiety and
her courtesy don quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle fixed
himself in his stirrups settled his visor gave rocinante the spur and
with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess who
having sent to summon the duke her husband told him while don quixote
was approaching all about the message and as both of them had read the
first part of this history and from it were aware of don quixotes crazy
turn they awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his
acquaintance meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with
everything he said and so long as he stayed with them to treat him as
a knight errant with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry
they had read for they themselves were very fond of them
don quixote now came up with his visor raised and as he seemed about to
dismount sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him but in
getting down off dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of
the ropes of the pack saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it
and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground don
quixote who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held
fancying that sancho had by this time come to hold it for him threw
himself off with a lurch and brought rocinantes saddle after him which
was no doubt badly girthed and saddle and he both came to the ground
not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered between his
teeth against the unlucky sancho who had his foot still in the shackles
the duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knight and squire and
they raised don quixote sorely shaken by his fall and he limping
advanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair this however
the duke would by no means permit on the contrary dismounting from his
horse he went and embraced don quixote saying i am grieved sir
knight of the rueful countenance that your first experience on my ground
should have been such an unfortunate one as we have seen but the
carelessness of squires is often the cause of worse accidents
that which has happened me in meeting you mighty prince replied don
quixote cannot be unfortunate even if my fall had not stopped short of
the depths of the bottomless pit for the glory of having seen you would
have lifted me up and delivered me from it my squire gods curse upon
him is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence than in
tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady but however i may
be allen or raised up on foot or on horseback i shall always be at
your service and that of my lady the duchess your worthy consort worthy
queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy
gently senor don quixote of la mancha said the duke where my lady
dona dulcinea del toboso is it is not right that other beauties should
sancho by this time released from his entanglement was standing by and
before his master could answer he said there is no denying and it must
be maintained that my lady dulcinea del toboso is very beautiful but
the hare jumps up where one least expects it and i have heard say that
what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay and he
who makes one fair vessel can as well make two or three or a hundred i
say so because by my faith my lady the duchess is in no way behind my
don quixote turned to the duchess and said your highness may conceive
that never had knight errant in this world a more talkative or a droller
squire than i have and he will prove the truth of what i say if your
highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days
to which the duchess made answer that worthy sancho is droll i consider
a very good thing because it is a sign that he is shrewd for drollery
and sprightliness senor don quixote as you very well know do not take
up their abode with dull wits and as good sancho is droll and sprightly
so much the better said the duke for many droll things cannot be
said in few words but not to lose time in talking come great knight of
of the lions your highness must say said sancho for there is no
he of the lions be it continued the duke i say let sir knight of
the lions come to a castle of mine close by where he shall be given that
reception which is due to so exalted a personage and which the duchess
and i are wont to give to all knights errant who come there
by this time sancho had fixed and girthed rocinantes saddle and don
quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse they
placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle the duchess
desired sancho to come to her side for she found infinite enjoyment in
listening to his shrewd remarks sancho required no pressing but pushed
himself in between them and the duke who thought it rare good fortune to
receive such a knight errant and such a homely squire in their castle
supreme was the satisfaction that sancho felt at seeing himself as it
seemed an established favourite with the duchess for he looked forward
to finding in her castle what he had found in don diegos house and in
basilios he was always fond of good living and always seized by the
forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented
itself the history informs us then that before they reached the
country house or castle the duke went on in advance and instructed all
his servants how they were to treat don quixote and so the instant he
came up to the castle gates with the duchess two lackeys or equerries
clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to
their feet hastened out and catching don quixote in their arms before
he saw or heard them said to him your highness should go and take my
don quixote obeyed and great bandying of compliments followed between
the two over the matter but in the end the duchesss determination
carried the day and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey
except in the arms of the duke saying she did not consider herself
worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight at length
the duke came out to take her down and as they entered a spacious court
two fair damsels came forward and threw over don quixotes shoulders a
large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth and at the same instant all the
galleries of the court were lined with the men servants and
women servants of the household crying welcome flower and cream of
knight errantry while all or most of them flung pellets filled with
scented water over don quixote and the duke and duchess at all which don
quixote was greatly astonished and this was the first time that he
thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight errant in reality and
not merely in fancy now that he saw himself treated in the same way as
he had read of such knights being treated in days of yore
sancho deserting dapple hung on to the duchess and entered the castle
but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone he
approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receive
the duchess and in a low voice he said to her senora gonzalez or
i am called dona rodriguez de grijalba replied the duenna what is
your will brother to which sancho made answer i should be glad if
your worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate where
you will find a grey ass of mine make them if you please put him in
the stable or put him there yourself for the poor little beast is
rather easily frightened and cannot bear being alone at all
if the master is as wise as the man said the duenna we have got a
fine bargain be off with you brother and bad luck to you and him who
brought you here go look after your ass for we the duennas of this
house are not used to work of that sort
well then in troth returned sancho i have heard my master who is
the very treasure finder of stories telling the story of lancelot when
he came from britain say that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon
his hack and if it comes to my ass i wouldnt change him for senor
if you are a jester brother said the duenna keep your drolleries
for some place where theyll pass muster and be paid for for youll get
at any rate it will be a very ripe one said sancho for you wont
lose the trick in years by a point too little
son of a bitch said the duenna all aglow with anger whether im old
or not its with god i have to reckon not with you you garlic stuffed
scoundrel and she said it so loud that the duchess heard it and
turning round and seeing the duenna in such a state of excitement and
her eyes flaming so asked whom she was wrangling with
with this good fellow here said the duenna who has particularly
requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gate into
the stable holding it up to me as an example that they did the same i
dont know where that some ladies waited on one lancelot and duennas on
his hack and what is more to wind up with he called me old
that said the duchess i should have considered the greatest affront
that could be offered me and addressing sancho she said to him you
must know friend sancho that dona rodriguez is very youthful and that
she wears that hood more for authority and custom sake than because of
may all the rest of mine be unlucky said sancho if i meant it that
way i only spoke because the affection i have for my ass is so great
and i thought i could not commend him to a more kind hearted person than
don quixote who was listening said to him is this proper conversation
senor replied sancho every one must mention what he wants wherever
he may be i thought of dapple here and i spoke of him here if i had
thought of him in the stable i would have spoken there
on which the duke observed sancho is quite right and there is no
reason at all to find fault with him dapple shall be fed to his hearts
content and sancho may rest easy for he shall be treated like himself
while this conversation amusing to all except don quixote was
proceeding they ascended the staircase and ushered don quixote into a
chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade six damsels relieved
him of his armour and waited on him like pages all of them prepared and
instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do and how
they were to treat don quixote so that he might see and believe they
were treating him like a knight errant when his armour was removed
there stood don quixote in his tight fitting breeches and chamois
doublet lean lanky and long with cheeks that seemed to be kissing
each other inside such a figure that if the damsels waiting on him had
not taken care to check their merriment which was one of the particular
directions their master and mistress had given them they would have
burst with laughter they asked him to let himself be stripped that they
might put a shirt on him but he would not on any account saying that
modesty became knights errant just as much as valour however he said
they might give the shirt to sancho and shutting himself in with him in
a room where there was a sumptuous bed he undressed and put on the
shirt and then finding himself alone with sancho he said to him tell
me thou new fledged buffoon and old booby dost thou think it right to
offend and insult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that
one just now was that a time to bethink thee of thy dapple or are these
noble personages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat
their owners in such elegant style for gods sake sancho restrain
thyself and dont show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse
boorish texture thou art of remember sinner that thou art the master
is the more esteemed the more respectable and well bred his servants are
and that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men
is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them dost
thou not see shortsighted being that thou art and unlucky mortal that i
am that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull blockhead
they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler nay nay sancho
friend keep clear oh keep clear of these stumbling blocks for he who
falls into the way of being a chatterbox and droll drops into a wretched
buffoon the first time he trips bridle thy tongue consider and weigh
thy words before they escape thy mouth and bear in mind we are now in
quarters whence by gods help and the strength of my arm we shall come
sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut and to
bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to
the purpose and well considered and told him he might make his mind easy
on that point for it should never be discovered through him what they
don quixote dressed himself put on his baldric with his sword threw the
scarlet mantle over his shoulders placed on his head a montera of green
satin that the damsels had given him and thus arrayed passed out into
the large room where he found the damsels drawn up in double file the
same number on each side all with the appliances for washing the hands
which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies then
came twelve pages together with the seneschal to lead him to dinner as
his hosts were already waiting for him they placed him in the midst of
them and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another
room where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers the
duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him and
with them a grave ecclesiastic one of those who rule noblemens houses
one of those who not being born magnates themselves never know how to
teach those who are how to behave as such one of those who would have
the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind one
of those who when they try to introduce economy into the household they
rule lead it into meanness one of this sort i say must have been the
grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive don
a vast number of polite speeches were exchanged and at length taking
don quixote between them they proceeded to sit down to table the duke
pressed don quixote to take the head of the table and though he
refused the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept
the ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him and the duke and duchess
those at the sides all this time sancho stood by gaping with amazement
at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons
and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the
duke and don quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the
table he said if your worship will give me leave i will tell you a
story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats
the moment sancho said this don quixote trembled making sure that he was
about to say something foolish sancho glanced at him and guessing his
thoughts said dont be afraid of my going astray senor or saying
anything that wont be pat to the purpose i havent forgotten the advice
your worship gave me just now about talking much or little well or ill
i have no recollection of anything sancho said don quixote say what
well then said sancho what i am going to say is so true that my
master don quixote who is here present will keep me from lying
lie as much as thou wilt for all i care sancho said don quixote for
i am not going to stop thee but consider what thou art going to say
i have so considered and reconsidered said sancho that the
bell ringers in a safe berth as will be seen by what follows
it would be well said don quixote if your highnesses would order
them to turn out this idiot for he will talk a heap of nonsense
by the life of the duke sancho shall not be taken away from me for a
moment said the duchess i am very fond of him for i know he is very
discreet be the days of your holiness said sancho for the good
opinion you have of my wit though theres none in me but the story i
want to tell is this there was an invitation given by a gentleman of my
town a very rich one and one of quality for he was one of the alamos
of medina del campo and married to dona mencia de quinones the daughter
of don alonso de maranon knight of the order of santiago that was
drowned at the herradura him there was that quarrel about years ago in
our village that my master don quixote was mixed up in to the best of
my belief that tomasillo the scapegrace the son of balbastro the smith
was wounded in isnt all this true master mine as you live say so
that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer
so far said the ecclesiastic i take you to be more a chatterer than
a liar but i dont know what i shall take you for by and by
thou citest so many witnesses and proofs sancho said don quixote
that i have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth go on
and cut the story short for thou art taking the way not to make an end
he is not to cut it short said the duchess on the contrary for my
gratification he is to tell it as he knows it though he should not
finish it these six days and if he took so many they would be to me the
well then sirs i say continued sancho that this same gentleman
whom i know as well as i do my own hands for its not a bowshot from my
house to his invited a poor but respectable labourer 
get on brother said the churchman at the rate you are going you
will not stop with your story short of the next world
ill stop less than half way please god said sancho and so i say
this labourer coming to the house of the gentleman i spoke of that
invited him rest his soul he is now dead and more by token he died the
death of an angel so they say for i was not there for just at that
time i had gone to reap at tembleque 
as you live my son said the churchman make haste back from
tembleque and finish your story without burying the gentleman unless
well then it so happened said sancho that as the pair of them were
going to sit down to table and i think i can see them now plainer than
great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation
the worthy churchman showed at the long winded halting way sancho had of
telling his story while don quixote was chafing with rage and vexation
so as i was saying continued sancho as the pair of them were going
to sit down to table as i said the labourer insisted upon the
gentlemans taking the head of the table and the gentleman insisted upon
the labourers taking it as his orders should be obeyed in his house
but the labourer who plumed himself on his politeness and good breeding
would not on any account until the gentleman out of patience putting
his hands on his shoulders compelled him by force to sit down saying
sit down you stupid lout for wherever i sit will be the head to you
and thats the story and troth i think it hasnt been brought in amiss
don quixote turned all colours which on his sunburnt face mottled it
till it looked like jasper the duke and duchess suppressed their
laughter so as not altogether to mortify don quixote for they saw
through sanchos impertinence and to change the conversation and keep
sancho from uttering more absurdities the duchess asked don quixote what
news he had of the lady dulcinea and if he had sent her any presents of
giants or miscreants lately for he could not but have vanquished a good
to which don quixote replied senora my misfortunes though they had a
beginning will never have an end i have vanquished giants and i have
sent her caitiffs and miscreants but where are they to find her if she
is enchanted and turned into the most ill favoured peasant wench that can
i dont know said sancho panza to me she seems the fairest creature
in the world at any rate in nimbleness and jumping she wont give in to
a tumbler by my faith senora duchess she leaps from the ground on to
the back of an ass like a cat
have you seen her enchanted sancho asked the duke
what seen her said sancho why who the devil was it but myself that
first thought of the enchantment business she is as much enchanted as my
the ecclesiastic when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and
enchantments began to suspect that this must be don quixote of la
mancha whose story the duke was always reading and he had himself often
reproved him for it telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries
and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct addressing the
duke he said very angrily to him senor your excellence will have to
give account to god for what this good man does this don quixote or don
simpleton or whatever his name is cannot i imagine be such a
blockhead as your excellence would have him holding out encouragement to
him to go on with his vagaries and follies then turning to address don
quixote he said and you num skull who put it into your head that you
are a knight errant and vanquish giants and capture miscreants go your
ways in a good hour and in a good hour be it said to you go home and
bring up your children if you have any and attend to your business and
give over going wandering about the world gaping and making a
laughing stock of yourself to all who know you and all who dont where
in heavens name have you discovered that there are or ever were
knights errant where are there giants in spain or miscreants in la
mancha or enchanted dulcineas or all the rest of the silly things they
don quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentlemans words and
as soon as he perceived he had done speaking regardless of the presence
of the duke and duchess he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an
agitated countenance and said but the reply deserves a chapter to
of the reply don quixote gave his censurer with other incidents grave
don quixote then having risen to his feet trembling from head to foot
like a man dosed with mercury said in a hurried agitated voice the
place i am in the presence in which i stand and the respect i have and
always have had for the profession to which your worship belongs hold
and bind the hands of my just indignation and as well for these reasons
as because i know as everyone knows that a gownsmans weapon is the
same as a womans the tongue i will with mine engage in equal combat
with your worship from whom one might have expected good advice instead
of foul abuse pious well meant reproof requires a different demeanour
and arguments of another sort at any rate to have reproved me in
public and so roughly exceeds the bounds of proper reproof for that
comes better with gentleness than with rudeness and it is not seemly to
call the sinner roundly blockhead and booby without knowing anything of
the sin that is reproved come tell me for which of the stupidities you
have observed in me do you condemn and abuse me and bid me go home and
look after my house and wife and children without knowing whether i have
any is nothing more needed than to get a footing by hook or by crook
in other peoples houses to rule over the masters and that perhaps
after having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary and
without having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty or
thirty leagues round to fit one to lay down the law rashly for
chivalry and pass judgment on knights errant is it haply an idle
occupation or is the time ill spent that is spent in roaming the world
in quest not of its enjoyments but of those arduous toils whereby the
good mount upwards to the abodes of everlasting life if gentlemen great
lords nobles men of high birth were to rate me as a fool i should take
it as an irreparable insult but i care not a farthing if clerks who have
never entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish
knight i am and knight i will die if such be the pleasure of the most
high some take the broad road of overweening ambition others that of
mean and servile flattery others that of deceitful hypocrisy and some
that of true religion but i led by my star follow the narrow path of
knight errantry and in pursuit of that calling i despise wealth but not
honour i have redressed injuries righted wrongs punished insolences
vanquished giants and crushed monsters i am in love for no other
reason than that it is incumbent on knights errant to be so but though i
am i am no carnal minded lover but one of the chaste platonic sort my
intentions are always directed to worthy ends to do good to all and evil
to none and if he who means this does this and makes this his practice
deserves to be called a fool it is for your highnesses to say o most
good by god cried sancho say no more in your own defence master
mine for theres nothing more in the world to be said thought or
insisted on and besides when this gentleman denies as he has that
there are or ever have been any knights errant in the world is it any
wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about
perhaps brother said the ecclesiastic you are that sancho panza
that is mentioned to whom your master has promised an island
yes i am said sancho and whats more i am one who deserves it as
much as anyone i am one of the sort attach thyself to the good and
thou wilt be one of them and of those not with whom thou art bred
but with whom thou art fed and of those who leans against a good
tree a good shade covers him i have leant upon a good master and i
have been for months going about with him and please god i shall be just
such another long life to him and long life to me for neither will he
be in any want of empires to rule or i of islands to govern
no sancho my friend certainly not said the duke for in the name of
senor don quixote i confer upon you the government of one of no small
go down on thy knees sancho said don quixote and kiss the feet of
his excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee
sancho obeyed and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table
completely out of temper exclaiming by the gown i wear i am almost
inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners
no wonder they are mad when people who are in their senses sanction
their madness i leave your excellence with them for so long as they are
in the house i will remain in my own and spare myself the trouble of
reproving what i cannot remedy and without uttering another word or
eating another morsel he went off the entreaties of the duke and
duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him not that the duke said
much to him for he could not because of the laughter his uncalled for
when he had done laughing he said to don quixote you have replied on
your own behalf so stoutly sir knight of the lions that there is no
occasion to seek further satisfaction for this which though it may look
like an offence is not so at all for as women can give no offence no
more can ecclesiastics as you very well know
that is true said don quixote and the reason is that he who is not
liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone women children and
ecclesiastics as they cannot defend themselves though they may receive
offence cannot be insulted because between the offence and the insult
there is as your excellence very well knows this difference the insult
comes from one who is capable of offering it and does so and maintains
it the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult to
take an example a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten
others come up armed and beat him he draws his sword and quits himself
like a man but the number of his antagonists makes it impossible for him
to effect his purpose and avenge himself this man suffers an offence but
not an insult another example will make the same thing plain a man is
standing with his back turned another comes up and strikes him and
after striking him takes to flight without waiting an instant and the
other pursues him but does not overtake him he who received the blow
received an offence but not an insult because an insult must be
maintained if he who struck him though he did so sneakingly and
treacherously had drawn his sword and stood and faced him then he who
had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time
offence because he was struck treacherously insult because he who struck
him maintained what he had done standing his ground without taking to
flight and so according to the laws of the accursed duel i may have
received offence but not insult for neither women nor children can
maintain it nor can they wound nor have they any way of standing their
ground and it is just the same with those connected with religion for
these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive and
so though naturally they are bound to defend themselves they have no
right to offend anybody and though i said just now i might have received
offence i say now certainly not for he who cannot receive an insult can
still less give one for which reasons i ought not to feel nor do i
feel aggrieved at what that good man said to me i only wish he had
stayed a little longer that i might have shown him the mistake he makes
in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any
knights errant in the world had amadis or any of his countless
descendants heard him say as much i am sure it would not have gone well
i will take my oath of that said sancho they would have given him a
slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a pomegranate or
a ripe melon they were likely fellows to put up with jokes of that sort
by my faith im certain if reinaldos of montalvan had heard the little
mans words he would have given him such a spank on the mouth that he
wouldnt have spoken for the next three years ay let him tackle them
and hell see how hell get out of their hands
the duchess as she listened to sancho was ready to die with laughter
and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his
master and there were a good many just then who were of the same
don quixote finally grew calm and dinner came to an end and as the
cloth was removed four damsels came in one of them with a silver basin
another with a jug also of silver a third with two fine white towels on
her shoulder and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows and in
her white hands for white they certainly were a round ball of naples
soap the one with the basin approached and with arch composure and
impudence thrust it under don quixotes chin who wondering at such a
ceremony said never a word supposing it to be the custom of that
country to wash beards instead of hands he therefore stretched his out
as far as he could and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the
damsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly raising snow flakes for
the soap lather was no less white not only over the beard but all over
the face and over the eyes of the submissive knight so that they were
perforce obliged to keep shut the duke and duchess who had not known
anything about this waited to see what came of this strange washing the
barber damsel when she had him a hands breadth deep in lather
pretended that there was no more water and bade the one with the jug go
and fetch some while senor don quixote waited she did so and don
quixote was left the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be
imagined all those present and there were a good many were watching
him and as they saw him there with half a yard of neck and that
uncommonly brown his eyes shut and his beard full of soap it was a
great wonder and only by great discretion that they were able to
restrain their laughter the damsels the concocters of the joke kept
their eyes down not daring to look at their master and mistress and as
for them laughter and anger struggled within them and they knew not
what to do whether to punish the audacity of the girls or to reward
them for the amusement they had received from seeing don quixote in such
at length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of
washing don quixote and the one who carried the towels very deliberately
wiped him and dried him and all four together making him a profound
obeisance and curtsey they were about to go when the duke lest don
quixote should see through the joke called out to the one with the basin
saying come and wash me and take care that there is water enough the
girl sharp witted and prompt came and placed the basin for the duke as
she had done for don quixote and they soon had him well soaped and
washed and having wiped him dry they made their obeisance and retired
it appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not
washed him as they had don quixote he would have punished them for their
impudence which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well
sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively and said to
himself god bless me if it were only the custom in this country to
wash squires beards too as well as knights for by god and upon my soul
i want it badly and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides id
what are you saying to yourself sancho asked the duchess
i was saying senora he replied that in the courts of other princes
when the cloth is taken away i have always heard say they give water for
the hands but not lye for the beard and that shows it is good to live
long that you may see much to be sure they say too that he who lives a
long life must undergo much evil though to undergo a washing of that
dont be uneasy friend sancho said the duchess i will take care
that my damsels wash you and even put you in the tub if necessary
ill be content with the beard said sancho at any rate for the
present and as for the future god has decreed what is to be
attend to worthy sanchos request seneschal said the duchess and do
the seneschal replied that senor sancho should be obeyed in everything
and with that he went away to dinner and took sancho along with him
while the duke and duchess and don quixote remained at table discussing a
great variety of things but all bearing on the calling of arms and
the duchess begged don quixote as he seemed to have a retentive memory
to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady
dulcinea del toboso for judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her
beauty she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world nay
don quixote sighed on hearing the duchesss request and said if i
could pluck out my heart and lay it on a plate on this table here before
your highnesss eyes it would spare my tongue the pain of telling what
can hardly be thought of for in it your excellence would see her
portrayed in full but why should i attempt to depict and describe in
detail and feature by feature the beauty of the peerless dulcinea the
burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine an enterprise
wherein the pencils of parrhasius timantes and apelles and the graver
of lysippus ought to be employed to paint it in pictures and carve it in
marble and bronze and ciceronian and demosthenian eloquence to sound its
what does demosthenian mean senor don quixote said the duchess it
is a word i never heard in all my life
demosthenian eloquence said don quixote means the eloquence of
demosthenes as ciceronian means that of cicero who were the two most
true said the duke you must have lost your wits to ask such a
question nevertheless senor don quixote would greatly gratify us if he
would depict her to us for never fear even in an outline or sketch she
will be something to make the fairest envious
i would do so certainly said don quixote had she not been blurred to
my minds eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time since
one of such a nature that i am more ready to weep over it than to
describe it for your highnesses must know that going a few days back to
kiss her hands and receive her benediction approbation and permission
for this third sally i found her altogether a different being from the
one i sought i found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a
peasant from fair to foul from an angel into a devil from fragrant to
pestiferous from refined to clownish from a dignified lady into a
jumping tomboy and in a word from dulcinea del toboso into a coarse
god bless me said the duke aloud at this who can have done the world
such an injury who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it
of the grace and gaiety that charmed it of the modesty that shed a
who replied don quixote who could it be but some malignant enchanter
of the many that persecute me out of envy that accursed race born into
the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good
and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked enchanters have persecuted
me enchanters persecute me still and enchanters will continue to
persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep
abyss of oblivion and they injure and wound me where they know i feel it
most for to deprive a knight errant of his lady is to deprive him of the
eyes he sees with of the sun that gives him light of the food whereby
he lives many a time before have i said it and i say it now once more
a knight errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves a building
without a foundation or a shadow without the body that causes it
there is no denying it said the duchess but still if we are to
believe the history of don quixote that has come out here lately with
general applause it is to be inferred from it if i mistake not that
you never saw the lady dulcinea and that the said lady is nothing in the
world but an imaginary lady one that you yourself begot and gave birth
to in your brain and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you
there is a good deal to be said on that point said don quixote god
knows whether there be any dulcinea or not in the world or whether she
is imaginary or not imaginary these are things the proof of which must
not be pushed to extreme lengths i have not begotten nor given birth to
my lady though i behold her as she needs must be a lady who contains in
herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the world
beautiful without blemish dignified without haughtiness tender and yet
modest gracious from courtesy and courteous from good breeding and
lastly of exalted lineage because beauty shines forth and excels with a
higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in the fair of lowly
that is true said the duke but senor don quixote will give me leave
to say what i am constrained to say by the story of his exploits that i
have read from which it is to be inferred that granting there is a
dulcinea in el toboso or out of it and that she is in the highest
degree beautiful as you have described her to us as regards the
loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the orianas
alastrajareas madasimas or others of that sort with whom as you well
to that i may reply said don quixote that dulcinea is the daughter
of her own works and that virtues rectify blood and that lowly virtue
is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice dulcinea besides
has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and sceptred
queen for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of
performing greater miracles and virtually though not formally she has
i protest senor don quixote said the duchess that in all you say
you go most cautiously and lead in hand as the saying is henceforth i
will believe myself and i will take care that everyone in my house
believes even my lord the duke if needs be that there is a dulcinea in
el toboso and that she is living to day and that she is beautiful and
nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as senor don quixote in her
service and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give
her or that i can think of but i cannot help entertaining a doubt and
having a certain grudge against sancho panza the doubt is this that the
aforesaid history declares that the said sancho panza when he carried a
letter on your worships behalf to the said lady dulcinea found her
sifting a sack of wheat and more by token it says it was red wheat a
thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage
to this don quixote made answer senora your highness must know that
everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary
limits of what happens to other knights errant whether it be that it is
directed by the inscrutable will of destiny or by the malice of some
jealous enchanter now it is an established fact that all or most famous
knights errant have some special gift one that of being proof against
enchantment another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that
he cannot be wounded as was the famous roland one of the twelve peers
of france of whom it is related that he could not be wounded except in
the sole of his left foot and that it must be with the point of a stout
pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever and so when bernardo
del carpio slew him at roncesvalles finding that he could not wound him
with steel he lifted him up from the ground in his arms and strangled
him calling to mind seasonably the death which hercules inflicted on
antaeus the fierce giant that they say was the son of terra i would
infer from what i have mentioned that perhaps i may have some gift of
this kind not that of being invulnerable because experience has many
times proved to me that i am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable
nor that of being proof against enchantment for i have already seen
myself thrust into a cage in which all the world would not have been
able to confine me except by force of enchantments but as i delivered
myself from that one i am inclined to believe that there is no other
that can hurt me and so these enchanters seeing that they cannot exert
their vile craft against my person revenge themselves on what i love
most and seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of dulcinea in whom
i live and therefore i am convinced that when my squire carried my
message to her they changed her into a common peasant girl engaged in
such a mean occupation as sifting wheat i have already said however
that that wheat was not red wheat nor wheat at all but grains of orient
pearl and as a proof of all this i must tell your highnesses that
coming to el toboso a short time back i was altogether unable to
discover the palace of dulcinea and that the next day though sancho my
squire saw her in her own proper shape which is the fairest in the
world to me she appeared to be a coarse ill favoured farm wench and by
no means a well spoken one she who is propriety itself and so as i am
not and so far as one can judge cannot be enchanted she it is that is
enchanted that is smitten that is altered changed and transformed in
her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me and for her shall i live
in ceaseless tears until i see her in her pristine state i have
