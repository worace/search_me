her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it
was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr
and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at
longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two
younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way teaching them playing with them and loving them
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the
next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection
and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are
sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners
former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton
elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not
in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in
talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his
willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there you
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at
pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so
many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but
the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the
possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly
occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its
proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for
the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her
alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the
next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and
with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned
in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they
entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for
half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which
the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone
building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and
while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the
hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to
the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less
fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they
followed her into the dining parlour it was a large well proportioned
room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went
to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood which
they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance
was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and
she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it
with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions but from every window there were beauties to be
seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of
his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of
splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of
viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting
herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me i should not have been allowed to invite them
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very like
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent but had not the courage for it at length however the question
was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs
reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with
a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day
her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the
likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures
over the mantelpiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought
up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added
but i am afraid he has turned out very wild
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures
is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner
looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell
mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late
masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then he was very fond of them
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mrs gardiner
oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so
accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she
mr gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either
by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his
time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate
if your master would marry you might see more of him
yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is
mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him
replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have
never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her
ideas that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was
there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in
yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could
not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are
good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and
he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the
elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner
yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs
reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects
of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the
furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever
lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but
themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw
anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
that is not very likely our authority was too good
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter
the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there
is nothing he would not do for her
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were
all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already
visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested
her and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest
contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds
was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow how much of
good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his
eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen
they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were
consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door
as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his
appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes
instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party
and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on
beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent
had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed in
derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few
moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took
the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but
elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings
followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her
coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the
world how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he
thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes
sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly
altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was
amazing but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what
a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put
his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she
distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then
was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in
what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything
she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was
not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while
ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the
valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading
many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which
brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods
to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed
it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the
valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the
bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner
who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was
therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their
progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the
taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the
man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this
slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy
approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before
they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared
for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the
turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his
politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place
but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when
some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought
she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the
connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and
so far from going away turned back with them and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased
could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every
expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy
invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment
must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and
continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can
it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his
manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a
change as this it is impossible that he should still love me
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two
gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water plant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated
in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found
elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred
her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on
together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been
very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we
left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they
will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been the last
mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion his
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a
pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow
me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was
satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and
pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had
reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not
tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might
have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollected
that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale
with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete a tete was
over on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her
aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now
say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more
than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such
attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham
or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features
are perfectly good but how came you to tell me that he was so
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked
him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied
her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him
at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off
elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal
master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in
as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from
his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different
construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor
wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in
confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming
her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing
but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above
all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their
arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on
the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these
newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of
elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing she was quite
amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked
up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction
took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her
being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though
little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance
womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there
was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much
they had not long been together before mr darcy told her that bingley
was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick
step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all
elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still
felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he
inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked
and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before
them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little
in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and
to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she
feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley
was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but
though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point
she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a
recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed
to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone
which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply
he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of
november when we were all dancing together at netherfield
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether
all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question
nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself
but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was
so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations
at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from
self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
their visitors stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose
to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner
at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations
readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing
how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its
acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of
society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for
her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on
this account as well as some others found herself when their
visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was
not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of
it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far
as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest
however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be
hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he
was a liberal man and did much good among the poor
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known
fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she
certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him
that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in
his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light
which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked
it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid
her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most
eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display
of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only
were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent
on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent
love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be
exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him
she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her
fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that
such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled
by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when
she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had
originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how
much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows
opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there
with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in
london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with
all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and
on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be
succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a
genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from
elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley
and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without
calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether
she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss
bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal
indifference and brevity and the other said no more
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole
party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other
gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more
necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions
to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers
entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded
as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss
bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the
pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton
they must be a great loss to your family
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone while
she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened
complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with
confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys
meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy
was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very
wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming
hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and
as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to
wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able
to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss
bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person
behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothers
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not
err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when
darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister
how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she
cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing
that we should not have known her again
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could
see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no
brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose
wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are
tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes
which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything
extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do
not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not
the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always
wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the
success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect
your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she
a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that
was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them
both the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked
of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but
himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of
him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but
on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and
her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by
themselves the one missent must first be attended to it had been
written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded
but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident
agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect
