to luscinda i told her all that had occurred as i did also to her
father entreating him to allow some delay and to defer the disposal of
her hand until i should see what the duke ricardo sought of me he gave
me the promise and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered
finally i presented myself to the duke and was received and treated by
him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work the old servants
growing envious of me and regarding the dukes inclination to show me
favour as an injury to themselves but the one to whom my arrival gave
the greatest pleasure was the dukes second son fernando by name a
gallant youth of noble generous and amorous disposition who very soon
made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody for
though the elder was attached to me and showed me kindness he did not
carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as don fernando it
so happened then that as between friends no secret remains unshared
and as the favour i enjoyed with don fernando had grown into friendship
he made all his thoughts known to me and in particular a love affair
which troubled his mind a little he was deeply in love with a peasant
girl a vassal of his fathers the daughter of wealthy parents and
herself so beautiful modest discreet and virtuous that no one who
knew her was able to decide in which of these respects she was most
highly gifted or most excelled the attractions of the fair peasant
raised the passion of don fernando to such a point that in order to gain
his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions he determined to pledge
his word to her to become her husband for to attempt it in any other way
was to attempt an impossibility bound to him as i was by friendship i
strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples i could think
of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course but perceiving i
produced no effect i resolved to make the duke ricardo his father
acquainted with the matter but don fernando being sharp witted and
shrewd foresaw and apprehended this perceiving that by my duty as a
good servant i was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to
the honour of my lord the duke and so to mislead and deceive me he
told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty
that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months and that
he wished the absence to be effected by our going both of us to my
fathers house under the pretence which he would make to the duke of
going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city which
produces the best in the world when i heard him say so even if his
resolution had not been so good a one i should have hailed it as one of
the happiest that could be imagined prompted by my affection seeing
what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to
see my luscinda with this thought and wish i commended his idea and
encouraged his design advising him to put it into execution as quickly
as possible as in truth absence produced its effect in spite of the
most deeply rooted feelings but as afterwards appeared when he said
this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of
husband and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with
safety to himself being in dread of what his father the duke would do
when he came to know of his folly it happened then that as with young
men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite which as its
final object is enjoyment comes to an end on obtaining it and that
which seemed to be love takes to flight as it cannot pass the limit
fixed by nature which fixes no limit to true love what i mean is that
after don fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and
his eagerness cooled and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself
in order to cure his love he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid
the duke gave him permission and ordered me to accompany him we
arrived at my city and my father gave him the reception due to his rank
i saw luscinda without delay and though it had not been dead or
deadened my love gathered fresh life to my sorrow i told the story of
it to don fernando for i thought that in virtue of the great friendship
he bore me i was bound to conceal nothing from him i extolled her
beauty her gaiety her wit so warmly that my praises excited in him a
desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions to my misfortune i
yielded to it showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a
window where we used to talk to one another as she appeared to him in
her dressing gown she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out
of his recollection speech failed him his head turned he was
spell bound and in the end love smitten as you will see in the course
of the story of my misfortune and to inflame still further his passion
which he hid from me and revealed to heaven alone it so happened that
one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father
in marriage so delicate so modest and so tender that on reading it he
told me that in luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and
understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the
world it is true and i own it now that though i knew what good cause
don fernando had to praise luscinda it gave me uneasiness to hear these
praises from his mouth and i began to fear and with reason to feel
distrust of him for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of
luscinda and he would start the subject himself even though he dragged
it in unseasonably a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of
jealousy not that i feared any change in the constancy or faith of
luscinda but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me
against don fernando contrived always to read the letters i sent to
luscinda and her answers to me under the pretence that he enjoyed the
wit and sense of both it so happened then that luscinda having begged
of me a book of chivalry to read one that she was very fond of amadis
don quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned than he said
had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the lady
luscinda was fond of books of chivalry no other laudation would have
been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding
for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for
such delightful reading been wanting so as far as i am concerned you
need waste no more words in describing her beauty worth and
intelligence for on merely hearing what her taste was i declare her to
be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world and i
wish your worship had along with amadis of gaul sent her the worthy don
rugel of greece for i know the lady luscinda would greatly relish
daraida and garaya and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd darinel and
the admirable verses of his bucolics sung and delivered by him with such
sprightliness wit and ease but a time may come when this omission can
be remedied and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your
worship to be so good as to come with me to my village for there i can
give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul
and the entertainment of my life though it occurs to me that i have not
got one of them now thanks to the spite of wicked and envious
enchanters but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to
interrupt your discourse for when i hear chivalry or knights errant
mentioned i can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun
can help giving heat or those of the moon moisture pardon me
therefore and proceed for that is more to the purpose now
while don quixote was saying this cardenio allowed his head to fall upon
his breast and seemed plunged in deep thought and though twice don
quixote bade him go on with his story he neither looked up nor uttered a
word in reply but after some time he raised his head and said i cannot
get rid of the idea nor will anyone in the world remove it or make me
think otherwise and he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe
anything else than that that arrant knave master elisabad made free with
that is not true by all thats good said don quixote in high wrath
turning upon him angrily as his way was and it is a very great
slander or rather villainy queen madasima was a very illustrious lady
and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made
free with a quack and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great
scoundrel and i will give him to know it on foot or on horseback armed
or unarmed by night or by day or as he likes best
cardenio was looking at him steadily and his mad fit having now come
upon him he had no disposition to go on with his story nor would don
quixote have listened to it so much had what he had heard about madasima
disgusted him strange to say he stood up for her as if she were in
earnest his veritable born lady to such a pass had his unholy books
brought him cardenio then being as i said now mad when he heard
himself given the lie and called a scoundrel and other insulting names
not relishing the jest snatched up a stone that he found near him and
with it delivered such a blow on don quixotes breast that he laid him on
his back sancho panza seeing his master treated in this fashion
attacked the madman with his closed fist but the ragged one received him
in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet
and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction the
goatherd who came to the rescue shared the same fate and having beaten
and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding place on the mountain sancho rose and with the rage he felt at
finding himself so belaboured without deserving it ran to take vengeance
on the goatherd accusing him of not giving them warning that this man
was at times taken with a mad fit for if they had known it they would
have been on their guard to protect themselves the goatherd replied that
he had said so and that if he had not heard him that was no fault of
his sancho retorted and the goatherd rejoined and the altercation
ended in their seizing each other by the beard and exchanging such
fisticuffs that if don quixote had not made peace between them they
leave me alone sir knight of the rueful countenance said sancho
grappling with the goatherd for of this fellow who is a clown like
myself and no dubbed knight i can safely take satisfaction for the
affront he has offered me fighting with him hand to hand like an honest
that is true said don quixote but i know that he is not to blame for
with this he pacified them and again asked the goatherd if it would be
possible to find cardenio as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the
end of his story the goatherd told him as he had told him before that
there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was but that if he
wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in
with him either in or out of his senses
which treats of the strange things that happened to the stout knight of
la mancha in the sierra morena and of his imitation of the penance of
don quixote took leave of the goatherd and once more mounting rocinante
bade sancho follow him which he having no ass did very discontentedly
they proceeded slowly making their way into the most rugged part of the
mountain sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master and
longing for him to begin so that there should be no breach of the
injunction laid upon him but unable to keep silence so long he said to
senor don quixote give me your worships blessing and dismissal for
id like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom i can at
any rate talk and converse as much as i like for to want me to go
through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when i have a
mind is burying me alive if luck would have it that animals spoke as
they did in the days of guisopete it would not be so bad because i
could talk to rocinante about whatever came into my head and so put up
with my ill fortune but it is a hard case and not to be borne with
patience to go seeking adventures all ones life and get nothing but
kicks and blanketings brickbats and punches and with all this to have
to sew up ones mouth without daring to say what is in ones heart just
i understand thee sancho replied don quixote thou art dying to have
the interdict i placed upon thy tongue removed consider it removed and
say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains
so be it said sancho let me speak now for god knows what will
happen by and by and to take advantage of the permit at once i ask
what made your worship stand up so for that queen majimasa or whatever
her name is or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of
hers or not for if your worship had let that pass and you were not a
judge in the matter it is my belief the madman would have gone on with
his story and the blow of the stone and the kicks and more than half a
in faith sancho answered don quixote if thou knewest as i do what
an honourable and illustrious lady queen madasima was i know thou
wouldst say i had great patience that i did not break in pieces the mouth
that uttered such blasphemies for a very great blasphemy it is to say or
imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon the truth of the story
is that that master elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great
prudence and sound judgment and served as governor and physician to the
queen but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving
very severe punishment and as a proof that cardenio did not know what he
was saying remember when he said it he was out of his wits
that is what i say said sancho there was no occasion for minding the
words of a madman for if good luck had not helped your worship and he
had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast a fine way we
should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder god confound her
and then would not cardenio have gone free as a madman
against men in their senses or against madmen said don quixote every
knight errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women whoever they
may be much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as queen
madasima for whom i have a particular regard on account of her amiable
qualities for besides being extremely beautiful she was very wise and
very patient under her misfortunes of which she had many and the
counsel and society of the master elisabad were a great help and support
to her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation hence the
ignorant and ill disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she
was his mistress and they lie i say it once more and will lie two
hundred times more all who think and say so
i neither say nor think so said sancho let them look to it with
their bread let them eat it they have rendered account to god whether
they misbehaved or not i come from my vineyard i know nothing i am not
fond of prying into other mens lives he who buys and lies feels it in
his purse moreover naked was i born naked i find myself i neither
lose nor gain but if they did what is that to me many think there are
flitches where there are no hooks but who can put gates to the open
god bless me said don quixote what a set of absurdities thou art
stringing together what has what we are talking about got to do with the
proverbs thou art threading one after the other for gods sake hold thy
tongue sancho and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and dont
meddle in what does not concern thee and understand with all thy five
senses that everything i have done am doing or shall do is well
founded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry for i
understand them better than all the world that profess them
senor replied sancho is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go
astray through these mountains without path or road looking for a madman
who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began
not his story but your worships head and my ribs and end by breaking
peace i say again sancho said don quixote for let me tell thee it
is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these
regions as that which i have of performing among them an achievement
wherewith i shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world
and it shall be such that i shall thereby set the seal on all that can
no replied he of the rueful countenance though it may be in the dice
that we may throw deuce ace instead of sixes but all will depend on thy
yes said don quixote for if thou dost return soon from the place
where i mean to send thee my penance will be soon over and my glory
will soon begin but as it is not right to keep thee any longer in
suspense waiting to see what comes of my words i would have thee know
sancho that the famous amadis of gaul was one of the most perfect
knights errant i am wrong to say he was one he stood alone the first
the only one the lord of all that were in the world in his time a fig
for don belianis and for all who say he equalled him in any respect
for my oath upon it they are deceiving themselves i say too that
when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy
the originals of the rarest painters that he knows and the same rule
holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to
adorn a state thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient
imitate ulysses in whose person and labours homer presents to us a
lively picture of prudence and patience as virgil too shows us in the
person of aeneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave
and skilful captain not representing or describing them as they were
but as they ought to be so as to leave the example of their virtues to
posterity in the same way amadis was the polestar day star sun of
valiant and devoted knights whom all we who fight under the banner of
love and chivalry are bound to imitate this then being so i consider
friend sancho that the knight errant who shall imitate him most closely
will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry now one of the
instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence
worth valour endurance fortitude and love was when he withdrew
rejected by the lady oriana to do penance upon the pena pobre changing
his name into that of beltenebros a name assuredly significant and
appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted so as it is
easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder
cutting off serpents heads slaying dragons routing armies destroying
fleets and breaking enchantments and as this place is so well suited
for a similar purpose i must not allow the opportunity to escape which
what is it in reality said sancho that your worship means to do in
such an out of the way place as this
have i not told thee answered don quixote that i mean to imitate
amadis here playing the victim of despair the madman the maniac so as
at the same time to imitate the valiant don roland when at the fountain
he had evidence of the fair angelica having disgraced herself with medoro
and through grief thereat went mad and plucked up trees troubled the
waters of the clear springs slew destroyed flocks burned down huts
levelled houses dragged mares after him and perpetrated a hundred
thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record and
though i have no intention of imitating roland or orlando or rotolando
for he went by all these names step by step in all the mad things he
did said and thought i will make a rough copy to the best of my power
of all that seems to me most essential but perhaps i shall content
myself with the simple imitation of amadis who without giving way to any
mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow gained as much fame
it seems to me said sancho that the knights who behaved in this way
had provocation and cause for those follies and penances but what cause
has your worship for going mad what lady has rejected you or what
evidence have you found to prove that the lady dulcinea del toboso has
there is the point replied don quixote and that is the beauty of
this business of mine no thanks to a knight errant for going mad when he
has cause the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation and let my
lady know if i do this in the dry what i would do in the moist
moreover i have abundant cause in the long separation i have endured from
my lady till death dulcinea del toboso for as thou didst hear that
shepherd ambrosio say the other day in absence all ills are felt and
feared and so friend sancho waste no time in advising me against so
rare so happy and so unheard of an imitation mad i am and mad i must
be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that i mean to send
by thee to my lady dulcinea and if it be such as my constancy deserves
my insanity and penance will come to an end and if it be to the opposite
effect i shall become mad in earnest and being so i shall suffer no
more thus in whatever way she may answer i shall escape from the
struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me enjoying in my
senses the boon thou bearest me or as a madman not feeling the evil thou
bringest me but tell me sancho hast thou got mambrinos helmet safe
for i saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch
tried to break it in pieces but could not by which the fineness of its
to which sancho made answer by the living god sir knight of the rueful
countenance i cannot endure or bear with patience some of the things
that your worship says and from them i begin to suspect that all you
tell me about chivalry and winning kingdoms and empires and giving
islands and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of
knights errant must be all made up of wind and lies and all pigments or
figments or whatever we may call them for what would anyone think that
heard your worship calling a barbers basin mambrinos helmet without
ever seeing the mistake all this time but that one who says and
maintains such things must have his brains addled i have the basin in my
sack all dinted and i am taking it home to have it mended to trim my
beard in it if by gods grace i am allowed to see my wife and children
look here sancho said don quixote by him thou didst swear by just
now i swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in
the world has or ever had is it possible that all this time thou hast
been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things
belonging to knights errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and
ravings and to go always by contraries and not because it really is so
but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us
that change and alter everything with us and turn things as they please
and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us thus what seems
to thee a barbers basin seems to me mambrinos helmet and to another it
will seem something else and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on
my side to make what is really and truly mambrines helmet seem a basin
to everybody for being held in such estimation as it is all the world
would pursue me to rob me of it but when they see it is only a barbers
basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it as was plainly shown by
him who tried to break it and left it on the ground without taking it
for by my faith had he known it he would never have left it behind
keep it safe my friend for just now i have no need of it indeed i
shall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as i was born
if i have a mind to follow roland rather than amadis in my penance
thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an
isolated peak among the others that surrounded it past its base there
flowed a gentle brook all around it spread a meadow so green and
luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it and forest
trees in abundance and shrubs and flowers added to the charms of the
spot upon this place the knight of the rueful countenance fixed his
choice for the performance of his penance and as he beheld it exclaimed
in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses
this is the place oh ye heavens that i select and choose for
bewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me this is
the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of
yon little brook and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly
the leaves of these mountain trees in testimony and token of the pain my
persecuted heart is suffering oh ye rural deities whoever ye be that
haunt this lone spot give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom
long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among
these wilds and complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful
one the end and limit of all human beauty oh ye wood nymphs and
dryads that dwell in the thickets of the forest so may the nimble
wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never disturb your sweet
repose help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at listening
to it oh dulcinea del toboso day of my night glory of my pain guide
of my path star of my fortune so may heaven grant thee in full all thou
seekest of it bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence
from thee has brought me and make that return in kindness that is due to
my fidelity oh lonely trees that from this day forward shall bear me
company in my solitude give me some sign by the gentle movement of your
boughs that my presence is not distasteful to you oh thou my squire
pleasant companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes fix well in thy
memory what thou shalt see me do here so that thou mayest relate and
report it to the sole cause of all and so saying he dismounted from
rocinante and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle and
giving him a slap on the croup said he gives thee freedom who is
bereft of it himself oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art
unfortunate in thy lot begone where thou wilt for thou bearest written
on thy forehead that neither astolfos hippogriff nor the famed frontino
that cost bradamante so dear could equal thee in speed
seeing this sancho said good luck to him who has saved us the trouble
of stripping the pack saddle off dapple by my faith he would not have
gone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise though
if he were here i would not let anyone strip him for there would be no
occasion as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him
inasmuch as his master which i was while it was gods pleasure was
nothing of the sort and indeed sir knight of the rueful countenance if
my departure and your worships madness are to come off in earnest it
will be as well to saddle rocinante again in order that he may supply the
want of dapple because it will save me time in going and returning for
if i go on foot i dont know when i shall get there or when i shall get
back as i am in truth a bad walker
i declare sancho returned don quixote it shall be as thou wilt for
thy plan does not seem to me a bad one and three days hence thou wilt
depart for i wish thee to observe in the meantime what i do and say for
her sake that thou mayest be able to tell it
but what more have i to see besides what i have seen said sancho
much thou knowest about it said don quixote i have now got to tear
up my garments to scatter about my armour knock my head against these
rocks and more of the same sort of thing which thou must witness
for the love of god said sancho be careful your worship how you
give yourself those knocks on the head for you may come across such a
rock and in such a way that the very first may put an end to the whole
contrivance of this penance and i should think if indeed knocks on the
head seem necessary to you and this business cannot be done without
them you might be content as the whole thing is feigned and
counterfeit and in joke you might be content i say with giving them
to yourself in the water or against something soft like cotton and
leave it all to me for ill tell my lady that your worship knocked your
head against a point of rock harder than a diamond
i thank thee for thy good intentions friend sancho answered don
quixote but i would have thee know that all these things i am doing are
not in joke but very much in earnest for anything else would be a
transgression of the ordinances of chivalry which forbid us to tell any
lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy and to do one thing
instead of another is just the same as lying so my knocks on the head
must be real solid and valid without anything sophisticated or
fanciful about them and it will be needful to leave me some lint to
dress my wounds since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam
it was worse losing the ass replied sancho for with him lint and all
were lost but i beg of your worship not to remind me again of that
accursed liquor for my soul not to say my stomach turns at hearing the
very name of it and i beg of you too to reckon as past the three days
you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do for i take them as seen
already and pronounced upon and i will tell wonderful stories to my
lady so write the letter and send me off at once for i long to return
and take your worship out of this purgatory where i am leaving you
purgatory dost thou call it sancho said don quixote rather call it
hell or even worse if there be anything worse
for one who is in hell said sancho nulla est retentio as i have
i do not understand what retentio means said don quixote
retentio answered sancho means that whoever is in hell never comes
nor can come out of it which will be the opposite case with your worship
or my legs will be idle that is if i have spurs to enliven rocinante
let me once get to el toboso and into the presence of my lady dulcinea
and i will tell her such things of the follies and madnesses for it is
all one that your worship has done and is still doing that i will
manage to make her softer than a glove though i find her harder than a
cork tree and with her sweet and honeyed answer i will come back through
the air like a witch and take your worship out of this purgatory that
seems to be hell but is not as there is hope of getting out of it
which as i have said those in hell have not and i believe your worship
that is true said he of the rueful countenance but how shall we
and the ass colt order too added sancho
all shall be included said don quixote and as there is no paper it
would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees as the ancients
did or on tablets of wax though that would be as hard to find just now
as paper but it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and
even more than conveniently written and that is in the note book that
belonged to cardenio and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper
in a good hand at the first village thou comest to where there is a
schoolmaster or if not any sacristan will copy it but see thou give it
not to any notary to copy for they write a law hand that satan could not
but what is to be done about the signature said sancho
the letters of amadis were never signed said don quixote
that is all very well said sancho but the order must needs be
signed and if it is copied they will say the signature is false and i
the order shall go signed in the same book said don quixote and on
seeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it as to the
loveletter thou canst put by way of signature yours till death the
knight of the rueful countenance and it will be no great matter if it
is in some other persons hand for as well as i recollect dulcinea can
neither read nor write nor in the whole course of her life has she seen
handwriting or letter of mine for my love and hers have been always
platonic not going beyond a modest look and even that so seldom that i
can safely swear i have not seen her four times in all these twelve years
i have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth
will one day devour and perhaps even of those four times she has not
once perceived that i was looking at her such is the retirement and
seclusion in which her father lorenzo corchuelo and her mother aldonza
so so said sancho lorenzo corchuelos daughter is the lady dulcinea
she it is said don quixote and she it is that is worthy to be lady
i know her well said sancho and let me tell you she can fling a
crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town giver of all good
but she is a brave lass and a right and stout one and fit to be
helpmate to any knight errant that is or is to be who may make her his
lady the whoreson wench what sting she has and what a voice i can tell
you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to
call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her
fathers and though they were better than half a league off they heard
her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower and the best of her
is that she is not a bit prudish for she has plenty of affability and
jokes with everybody and has a grin and a jest for everything so sir
knight of the rueful countenance i say you not only may and ought to do
mad freaks for her sake but you have a good right to give way to despair
and hang yourself and no one who knows of it but will say you did well
though the devil should take you and i wish i were on my road already
simply to see her for it is many a day since i saw her and she must be
altered by this time for going about the fields always and the sun and
the air spoil womens looks greatly but i must own the truth to your
worship senor don quixote until now i have been under a great mistake
for i believed truly and honestly that the lady dulcinea must be some
princess your worship was in love with or some person great enough to
deserve the rich presents you have sent her such as the biscayan and the
galley slaves and many more no doubt for your worship must have won
many victories in the time when i was not yet your squire but all things
considered what good can it do the lady aldonza lorenzo i mean the lady
dulcinea del toboso to have the vanquished your worship sends or will
send coming to her and going down on their knees before her because may
be when they came shed be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing
floor and theyd be ashamed to see her and shed laugh or resent the
i have before now told thee many times sancho said don quixote that
thou art a mighty great chatterer and that with a blunt wit thou art
always striving at sharpness but to show thee what a fool thou art and
how rational i am i would have thee listen to a short story thou must
know that a certain widow fair young independent and rich and above
all free and easy fell in love with a sturdy strapping young
lay brother his superior came to know of it and one day said to the
worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance i am surprised senora
and not without good reason that a woman of such high standing so fair
and so rich as you are should have fallen in love with such a mean low
stupid fellow as so and so when in this house there are so many masters
graduates and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if
they were a lot of pears saying this one ill take that i wont take
but she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour my dear
sir you are very much mistaken and your ideas are very old fashioned
if you think that i have made a bad choice in so and so fool as he
seems because for all i want with him he knows as much and more
philosophy than aristotle in the same way sancho for all i want with
dulcinea del toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on
earth it is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises
of ladies under the fancy names they give them had any such mistresses
thinkest thou that the amarillises the phillises the sylvias the
dianas the galateas the filidas and all the rest of them that the
books the ballads the barbers shops the theatres are full of were
really and truly ladies of flesh and blood and mistresses of those that
glorify and have glorified them nothing of the kind they only invent
them for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses and that
they may pass for lovers or for men valiant enough to be so and so it
suffices me to think and believe that the good aldonza lorenzo is fair
and virtuous and as to her pedigree it is very little matter for no one
will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her
and i for my part reckon her the most exalted princess in the world
for thou shouldst know sancho if thou dost not know that two things
alone beyond all others are incentives to love and these are great
beauty and a good name and these two things are to be found in dulcinea
in the highest degree for in beauty no one equals her and in good name
few approach her and to put the whole thing in a nutshell i persuade
myself that all i say is as i say neither more nor less and i picture
her in my imagination as i would have her to be as well in beauty as in
condition helen approaches her not nor does lucretia come up to her nor
any other of the famous women of times past greek barbarian or latin
and let each say what he will for if in this i am taken to task by the
ignorant i shall not be censured by the critical
i say that your worship is entirely right said sancho and that i am
an ass but i know not how the name of ass came into my mouth for a rope
is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged but now
for the letter and then god be with you i am off
don quixote took out the note book and retiring to one side very
deliberately began to write the letter and when he had finished it he
called to sancho saying he wished to read it to him so that he might
commit it to memory in case of losing it on the road for with evil
fortune like his anything might be apprehended to which sancho replied
write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me and i
will carry it very carefully because to expect me to keep it in my
memory is all nonsense for i have such a bad one that i often forget my
own name but for all that repeat it to me as i shall like to hear it
for surely it will run as if it was in print
listen said don quixote this is what it says
sovereign and exalted lady the pierced by the point of absence the
wounded to the hearts core sends thee sweetest dulcinea del toboso
the health that he himself enjoys not if thy beauty despises me if thy
worth is not for me if thy scorn is my affliction though i be
sufficiently long suffering hardly shall i endure this anxiety which
besides being oppressive is protracted my good squire sancho will
relate to thee in full fair ingrate dear enemy the condition to which
i am reduced on thy account if it be thy pleasure to give me relief i
am thine if not do as may be pleasing to thee for by ending my life i
by the life of my father said sancho when he heard the letter it is
the loftiest thing i ever heard body of me how your worship says
everything as you like in it and how well you fit in the knight of the
rueful countenance into the signature i declare your worship is indeed
the very devil and there is nothing you dont know
everything is needed for the calling i follow said don quixote
now then said sancho let your worship put the order for the three
ass colts on the other side and sign it very plainly that they may
with all my heart said don quixote and as he had written it he read
mistress niece by this first of ass colts please pay to sancho panza
my squire three of the five i left at home in your charge said three
ass colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here in
hand which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid done in
the heart of the sierra morena the twenty seventh of august of this
that will do said sancho now let your worship sign it
there is no need to sign it said don quixote but merely to put my
flourish which is the same as a signature and enough for three asses
i can trust your worship returned sancho let me go and saddle
rocinante and be ready to give me your blessing for i mean to go at
once without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do ill say i
saw you do so many that she will not want any more
at any rate sancho said don quixote i should like and there is
reason for it i should like thee i say to see me stripped to the skin
and performing a dozen or two of insanities which i can get done in less
than half an hour for having seen them with thine own eyes thou canst
then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add and i promise thee
thou wilt not tell of as many as i mean to perform
for the love of god master mine said sancho let me not see your
worship stripped for it will sorely grieve me and i shall not be able
to keep from tears and my head aches so with all i shed last night for
dapple that i am not fit to begin any fresh weeping but if it is your
worships pleasure that i should see some insanities do them in your
clothes short ones and such as come readiest to hand for i myself want
nothing of the sort and as i have said it will be a saving of time for
my return which will be with the news your worship desires and deserves
if not let the lady dulcinea look to it if she does not answer
reasonably i swear as solemnly as i can that i will fetch a fair answer
out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs for why should it be borne that
a knight errant as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme or
reason for a  her ladyship had best not drive me to say it for by god
i will speak out and let off everything cheap even if it doesnt sell i
am pretty good at that she little knows me faith if she knew me shed
in faith sancho said don quixote to all appearance thou art no
i am not so mad answered sancho but i am more peppery but apart
from all this what has your worship to eat until i come back will you
sally out on the road like cardenio to force it from the shepherds
let not that anxiety trouble thee replied don quixote for even if i
had it i should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which this
meadow and these trees may yield me the beauty of this business of mine
lies in not eating and in performing other mortifications
do you know what i am afraid of said sancho upon this that i shall
not be able to find my way back to this spot where i am leaving you it
is such an out of the way place
observe the landmarks well said don quixote for i will try not to go
far from this neighbourhood and i will even take care to mount the
highest of these rocks to see if i can discover thee returning however
not to miss me and lose thyself the best plan will be to cut some
branches of the broom that is so abundant about here and as thou goest
to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain these
will serve thee after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of
theseus as marks and signs for finding me on thy return
so i will said sancho panza and having cut some he asked his
masters blessing and not without many tears on both sides took his
leave of him and mounting rocinante of whom don quixote charged him
earnestly to have as much care as of his own person he set out for the
plain strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had
recommended him and so he went his way though don quixote still
entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts he had not
gone a hundred paces however when he returned and said
i must say senor your worship said quite right that in order to be
able to swear without a weight on my conscience that i had seen you do
mad things it would be well for me to see if it were only one though in
your worships remaining here i have seen a very great one
did i not tell thee so said don quixote wait sancho and i will do
them in the saying of a credo and pulling off his breeches in all haste
he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt and then without more
ado he cut a couple of gambados in the air and a couple of somersaults
heels over head making such a display that not to see it a second time
sancho wheeled rocinante round and felt easy and satisfied in his mind
that he could swear he had left his master mad and so we will leave him
to follow his road until his return which was a quick one
in which are continued the refinements wherewith don quixote played the
part of a lover in the sierra morena
returning to the proceedings of him of the rueful countenance when he
found himself alone the history says that when don quixote had completed
the performance of the somersaults or capers naked from the waist down
and clothed from the waist up and saw that sancho had gone off without
waiting to see any more crazy feats he climbed up to the top of a high
rock and there set himself to consider what he had several times before
considered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point namely
whether it would be better and more to his purpose to imitate the
outrageous madness of roland or the melancholy madness of amadis and
what wonder is it if roland was so good a knight and so valiant as
everyone says he was when after all he was enchanted and nobody could
kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot and
he always wore shoes with seven iron soles though cunning devices did
not avail him against bernardo del carpio who knew all about them and
strangled him in his arms at roncesvalles but putting the question of
his valour aside let us come to his losing his wits for certain it is
that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at the
fountain and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of angelica having
slept more than two siestas with medoro a little curly headed moor and
page to agramante if he was persuaded that this was true and that his
lady had wronged him it is no wonder that he should have gone mad but
i how am i to imitate him in his madness unless i can imitate him in
the cause of it for my dulcinea i will venture to swear never saw a
moor in her life as he is in his proper costume and she is this day as
the mother that bore her and i should plainly be doing her a wrong if
fancying anything else i were to go mad with the same kind of madness as
roland the furious on the other hand i see that amadis of gaul without
losing his senses and without doing anything mad acquired as a lover as
much fame as the most famous for according to his history on finding
himself rejected by his lady oriana who had ordered him not to appear in
her presence until it should be her pleasure all he did was to retire to
the pena pobre in company with a hermit and there he took his fill of
weeping until heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and
need and if this be true as it is why should i now take the trouble to
strip stark naked or do mischief to these trees which have done me no
harm or why am i to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will
give me to drink whenever i have a mind long live the memory of amadis
and let him be imitated so far as is possible by don quixote of la
mancha of whom it will be said as was said of the other that if he did
not achieve great things he died in attempting them and if i am not
repulsed or rejected by my dulcinea it is enough for me as i have said
to be absent from her and so now to business come to my memory ye
deeds of amadis and show me how i am to begin to imitate you i know
already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to god
but what am i to do for a rosary for i have not got one
and then it occurred to him how he might make one and that was by
tearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down and
making eleven knots on it one bigger than the rest and this served him
for a rosary all the time he was there during which he repeated
countless ave marias but what distressed him greatly was not having
another hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from and so
he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow and writing
and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of
verses all in harmony with his sadness and some in praise of dulcinea
but when he was found there afterwards the only ones completely legible
that could be discovered were those that follow here
ye green things all trees shrubs and bushes
but hill or dale or high or low
and plies his cruel scourge ah me a
the addition of del toboso to dulcineas name gave rise to no little
laughter among those who found the above lines for they suspected don
quixote must have fancied that unless he added del toboso when he
introduced the name of dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible which
was indeed the fact as he himself afterwards admitted he wrote many
more but as has been said these three verses were all that could be
plainly and perfectly deciphered in this way and in sighing and calling
on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams and
echo moist and mournful to answer console and hear him as well as in
looking for herbs to sustain him he passed his time until sanchos
return and had that been delayed three weeks as it was three days the
knight of the rueful countenance would have worn such an altered
countenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him and
here it will be well to leave him wrapped up in sighs and verses to
relate how sancho panza fared on his mission
as for him coming out upon the high road he made for el toboso and the
next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen
him as soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living
through the air and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was
an hour when he might well have done so for it was dinner time and he
longed to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for
many days past this craving drove him to draw near to the inn still
undecided whether to go in or not and as he was hesitating there came
out two persons who at once recognised him and said one to the other
senor licentiate is not he on the horse there sancho panza who our
adventurers housekeeper told us went off with her master as esquire
so it is said the licentiate and that is our friend don quixotes
horse and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate
and the barber of his own village the same who had carried out the
scrutiny and sentence upon the books and as soon as they recognised
sancho panza and rocinante being anxious to hear of don quixote they
approached and calling him by his name the curate said friend sancho
sancho recognised them at once and determined to keep secret the place
and circumstances where and under which he had left his master so he
replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain
matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the
nay nay said the barber if you dont tell us where he is sancho
panza we will suspect as we suspect already that you have murdered and
robbed him for here you are mounted on his horse in fact you must
produce the master of the hack or else take the consequences
there is no need of threats with me said sancho for i am not a man
to rob or murder anybody let his own fate or god who made him kill
each one my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in
the midst of these mountains and then offhand and without stopping he
told them how he had left him what adventures had befallen him and how
he was carrying a letter to the lady dulcinea del toboso the daughter of
lorenzo corchuelo with whom he was over head and ears in love they were
both amazed at what sancho panza told them for though they were aware of
don quixotes madness and the nature of it each time they heard of it
they were filled with fresh wonder they then asked sancho panza to show
them the letter he was carrying to the lady dulcinea del toboso he said
it was written in a note book and that his masters directions were that
he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to on
this the curate said if he showed it to him he himself would make a fair
copy of it sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the note book
but could not find it nor if he had been searching until now could he
have found it for don quixote had kept it and had never given it to
him nor had he himself thought of asking for it when sancho discovered
he could not find the book his face grew deadly pale and in great haste
he again felt his body all over and seeing plainly it was not to be
found without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked
away half of it and then as quick as he could and without stopping
gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were
seeing this the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him
what should happen me replied sancho but to have lost from one hand
to the other in a moment three ass colts each of them like a castle
i have lost the note book said sancho that contained the letter to
dulcinea and an order signed by my master in which he directed his niece
to give me three ass colts out of four or five he had at home and he
then told them about the loss of dapple
the curate consoled him telling him that when his master was found he
would get him to renew the order and make a fresh draft on paper as was
usual and customary for those made in notebooks were never accepted or
sancho comforted himself with this and said if that were so the loss of
dulcineas letter did not trouble him much for he had it almost by
heart and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they
repeat it then sancho said the barber and we will write it down
sancho panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his
memory and balanced himself now on one foot now the other one moment
staring at the ground the next at the sky and after having half gnawed
off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to
begin he said after a long pause by god senor licentiate devil a
thing can i recollect of the letter but it said at the beginning
it cannot have said scrubbing said the barber but superhuman or
that is it said sancho then as well as i remember it went on the
wounded and wanting of sleep and the pierced kisses your worships
hands ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one and it said something
or other about health and sickness that he was sending her and from that
it went tailing off until it ended with yours till death the knight of
it gave them no little amusement both of them to see what a good memory
