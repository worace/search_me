something but i dont know what to send unless it be some very curious
clyster pipes to work with bladders that they make in this island but
if the office remains with me ill find out something to send one way or
another if my wife teresa panza writes to me pay the postage and send
me the letter for i have a very great desire to hear how my house and
wife and children are going on and so may god deliver your worship from
evil minded enchanters and bring me well and peacefully out of this
government which i doubt for i expect to take leave of it and my life
together from the way doctor pedro recio treats me
the secretary sealed the letter and immediately dismissed the courier
and those who were carrying on the joke against sancho putting their
heads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government
sancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to
the good government of what he fancied the island and he ordained that
there were to be no provision hucksters in the state and that men might
import wine into it from any place they pleased provided they declared
the quarter it came from so that a price might be put upon it according
to its quality reputation and the estimation it was held in and he
that watered his wine or changed the name was to forfeit his life for
it he reduced the prices of all manner of shoes boots and stockings
but of shoes in particular as they seemed to him to run extravagantly
high he established a fixed rate for servants wages which were
becoming recklessly exorbitant he laid extremely heavy penalties upon
those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day or night he decreed
that no blind man should sing of any miracle in verse unless he could
produce authentic evidence that it was true for it was his opinion that
most of those the blind men sing are trumped up to the detriment of the
true ones he established and created an alguacil of the poor not to
harass them but to examine them and see whether they really were so for
many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make believe
crippled limb or a sham sore in a word he made so many good rules that
to this day they are preserved there and are called the constitutions of
wherein is related the adventure of the second distressed or afflicted
cide hamete relates that don quixote being now cured of his scratches
felt that the life he was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent
with the order of chivalry he professed so he determined to ask the duke
and duchess to permit him to take his departure for saragossa as the
time of the festival was now drawing near and he hoped to win there the
suit of armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort but one day
at table with the duke and duchess just as he was about to carry his
resolution into effect and ask for their permission lo and behold
suddenly there came in through the door of the great hall two women as
they afterwards proved to be draped in mourning from head to foot one
of whom approaching don quixote flung herself at full length at his feet
pressing her lips to them and uttering moans so sad so deep and so
doleful that she put all who heard and saw her into a state of
perplexity and though the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke
their servants were playing off upon don quixote still the earnest way
the woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel
uncertain until don quixote touched with compassion raised her up and
made her unveil herself and remove the mantle from her tearful face she
complied and disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated for she
disclosed the countenance of dona rodriguez the duenna of the house the
other female in mourning being her daughter who had been made a fool of
by the rich farmers son all who knew her were filled with astonishment
and the duke and duchess more than any for though they thought her a
simpleton and a weak creature they did not think her capable of crazy
pranks dona rodriguez at length turning to her master and mistress
said to them will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to
this gentleman for a moment for it is requisite i should do so in order
to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an
the duke said that for his part he gave her leave and that she might
speak with senor don quixote as much as she liked
she then turning to don quixote and addressing herself to him said
some days since valiant knight i gave you an account of the injustice
and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter the
unhappy damsel here before you and you promised me to take her part and
right the wrong that has been done her but now it has come to my hearing
that you are about to depart from this castle in quest of such fair
adventures as god may vouchsafe to you therefore before you take the
road i would that you challenge this froward rustic and compel him to
marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to become her
husband before he seduced her for to expect that my lord the duke will
do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree for the reason i stated
privately to your worship and so may our lord grant you good health and
to these words don quixote replied very gravely and solemnly worthy
duenna check your tears or rather dry them and spare your sighs for i
take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter for whom it
would have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers
promises which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly
performed and so with my lord the dukes leave i will at once go in
quest of this inhuman youth and will find him out and challenge him and
slay him if so be he refuses to keep his promised word for the chief
object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud i
mean to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors
there is no necessity said the duke for your worship to take the
trouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains
nor is there any necessity either for asking my leave to challenge him
for i admit him duly challenged and will take care that he is informed
of the challenge and accepts it and comes to answer it in person to
this castle of mine where i shall afford to both a fair field observing
all the conditions which are usually and properly observed in such
trials and observing too justice to both sides as all princes who offer
a free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships are bound
then with that assurance and your highnesss good leave said don
quixote i hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood and
come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of the
wrong doer making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter into
combat with me and so i challenge and defy him though absent on the
plea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel who was
a maiden and now by his misdeed is none and say that he shall fulfill
the promise he gave her to become her lawful husband or else stake his
and then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall
and the duke picked it up saying as he had said before that he
accepted the challenge in the name of his vassal and fixed six days
thence as the time the courtyard of the castle as the place and for
arms the customary ones of knights lance and shield and full armour
with all the other accessories without trickery guile or charms of any
sort and examined and passed by the judges of the field but first of
all he said it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy
damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of don quixote
for otherwise nothing can be done nor can the said challenge be brought
i do so place it replied the duenna
and i too added her daughter all in tears and covered with shame and
this declaration having been made and the duke having settled in his own
mind what he would do in the matter the ladies in black withdrew and
the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated
as servants of hers but as lady adventurers who came to her house to
demand justice so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them
as they would on strangers to the consternation of the other
women servants who did not know where the folly and imprudence of dona
and now to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a
satisfactory end lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and
presents to teresa panza the wife of the governor sancho entered the
hall and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him being
anxious to know the result of his journey but when they asked him the
page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in
a few words and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait
for a private opportunity and in the meantime amuse themselves with
these letters and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchesss
hand one bore by way of address letter for my lady the duchess
so and so of i dont know where and the other to my husband sancho
panza governor of the island of barataria whom god prosper longer than
me the duchesss bread would not bake as the saying is until she had
read her letter and having looked over it herself and seen that it might
be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear she read out as
the letter your highness wrote me my lady gave me great pleasure for
indeed i found it very welcome the string of coral beads is very fine
and my husbands hunting suit does not fall short of it all this village
is very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good
man sancho though nobody will believe it particularly the curate and
master nicholas the barber and the bachelor samson carrasco but i dont
care for that for so long as it is true as it is they may all say what
they like though to tell the truth if the coral beads and the suit had
not come i would not have believed it either for in this village
everybody thinks my husband a numskull and except for governing a flock
of goats they cannot fancy what sort of government he can be fit for
god grant it and direct him according as he sees his children stand in
need of it i am resolved with your worships leave lady of my soul to
make the most of this fair day and go to court to stretch myself at ease
in a coach and make all those i have envying me already burst their eyes
out so i beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a small
trifle of money and to let it be something to speak of because ones
expenses are heavy at the court for a loaf costs a real and meat thirty
maravedis a pound which is beyond everything and if he does not want me
to go let him tell me in time for my feet are on the fidgets to be off
and my friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and i make a
figure and a brave show at court my husband will come to be known far
more by me than i by him for of course plenty of people will ask who
are those ladies in that coach and some servant of mine will answer
the wife and daughter of sancho panza governor of the island of
barataria and in this way sancho will become known and ill be thought
well of and to rome for everything i am as vexed as vexed can be that
they have gathered no acorns this year in our village for all that i
send your highness about half a peck that i went to the wood to gather
and pick out one by one myself and i could find no bigger ones i wish
let not your high mightiness forget to write to me and i will take care
to answer and let you know how i am and whatever news there may be in
this place where i remain praying our lord to have your highness in his
sancha my daughter and my son kiss your worships hands
she who would rather see your ladyship than write to you
all were greatly amused by teresa panzas letter but particularly the
duke and duchess and the duchess asked don quixotes opinion whether
they might open the letter that had come for the governor which she
suspected must be very good don quixote said that to gratify them he
would open it and did so and found that it ran as follows
teresa panzas letter to her husband sancho panza
i got thy letter sancho of my soul and i promise thee and swear as a
catholic christian that i was within two fingers breadth of going mad i
was so happy i can tell thee brother when i came to hear that thou
wert a governor i thought i should have dropped dead with pure joy and
thou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow and as
for sanchica thy daughter she leaked from sheer happiness i had before
me the suit thou didst send me and the coral beads my lady the duchess
sent me round my neck and the letters in my hands and there was the
bearer of them standing by and in spite of all this i verily believed
and thought that what i saw and handled was all a dream for who could
have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of islands thou
knowest my friend what my mother used to say that one must live long
to see much i say it because i expect to see more if i live longer for
i dont expect to stop until i see thee a farmer of taxes or a collector
of revenue which are offices where though the devil carries off those
who make a bad use of them still they make and handle money my lady the
duchess will tell thee the desire i have to go to the court consider the
matter and let me know thy pleasure i will try to do honour to thee by
neither the curate nor the barber nor the bachelor nor even the
sacristan can believe that thou art a governor and they say the whole
thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair like everything belonging
to thy master don quixote and samson says he must go in search of thee
and drive the government out of thy head and the madness out of don
quixotes skull i only laugh and look at my string of beads and plan
out the dress i am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit i sent
some acorns to my lady the duchess i wish they had been gold send me
some strings of pearls if they are in fashion in that island here is the
news of the village la berrueca has married her daughter to a
good for nothing painter who came here to paint anything that might turn
up the council gave him an order to paint his majestys arms over the
door of the town hall he asked two ducats which they paid him in
advance he worked for eight days and at the end of them had nothing
painted and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things
he returned the money and for all that has married on the pretence of
being a good workman to be sure he has now laid aside his paint brush
and taken a spade in hand and goes to the field like a gentleman pedro
lobos son has received the first orders and tonsure with the intention
of becoming a priest minguilla mingo silvatos granddaughter found it
out and has gone to law with him on the score of having given her
promise of marriage evil tongues say she is with child by him but he
denies it stoutly there are no olives this year and there is not a drop
of vinegar to be had in the whole village a company of soldiers passed
through here when they left they took away with them three of the girls
of the village i will not tell thee who they are perhaps they will come
back and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wives
with all their blemishes good or bad sanchica is making bonelace she
earns eight maravedis a day clear which she puts into a moneybox as a
help towards house furnishing but now that she is a governors daughter
thou wilt give her a portion without her working for it the fountain in
the plaza has run dry a flash of lightning struck the gibbet and i wish
they all lit there i look for an answer to this and to know thy mind
about my going to the court and so god keep thee longer than me or as
long for i would not leave thee in this world without me
the letters were applauded laughed over relished and admired and
then as if to put the seal to the business the courier arrived
bringing the one sancho sent to don quixote and this too was read out
and it raised some doubts as to the governors simplicity the duchess
withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in sanchos village
which he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance
unmentioned he gave her the acorns and also a cheese which teresa had
given him as being particularly good and superior to those of tronchon
the duchess received it with greatest delight in which we will leave
her to describe the end of the government of the great sancho panza
flower and mirror of all governors of islands
of the troublous end and termination sancho panzas government came to
to fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for ever
in the same state is an idle fancy on the contrary in it everything
seems to go in a circle i mean round and round the spring succeeds the
summer the summer the fall the fall the autumn the autumn the winter
and the winter the spring and so time rolls with never ceasing wheel
mans life alone swifter than time speeds onward to its end without any
hope of renewal save it be in that other life which is endless and
boundless thus saith cide hamete the mahometan philosopher for there
are many that by the light of nature alone without the light of faith
have a comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this
present life and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for
but our author is here speaking of the rapidity with which sanchos
government came to an end melted away disappeared vanished as it were
in smoke and shadow for as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day
of his government sated not with bread and wine but with delivering
judgments and giving opinions and making laws and proclamations just as
sleep in spite of hunger was beginning to close his eyelids he heard
such a noise of bell ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the
whole island was going to the bottom he sat up in bed and remained
listening intently to try if he could make out what could be the cause of
so great an uproar not only however was he unable to discover what it
was but as countless drums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of
the bells and shouts he was more puzzled than ever and filled with fear
and terror and getting up he put on a pair of slippers because of the
dampness of the floor and without throwing a dressing gown or anything
of the kind over him he rushed out of the door of his room just in time
to see approaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons
with lighted torches and naked swords in their hands all shouting out
to arms to arms senor governor to arms the enemy is in the island in
countless numbers and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to
keeping up this noise tumult and uproar they came to where sancho
stood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard and as they
approached one of them called out to him arm at once your lordship if
you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost
what have i to do with arming said sancho what do i know about arms
or supports better leave all that to my master don quixote who will
settle it and make all safe in a trice for i sinner that i am god help
ah senor governor said another what slackness of mettle this is
arm yourself here are arms for you offensive and defensive come out to
the plaza and be our leader and captain it falls upon you by right for
arm me then in gods name said sancho and they at once produced two
large shields they had come provided with and placed them upon him over
his shirt without letting him put on anything else one shield in front
and the other behind and passing his arms through openings they had
made they bound him tight with ropes so that there he was walled and
boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his knees or stir
a single step in his hand they placed a lance on which he leant to keep
himself from falling and as soon as they had him thus fixed they bade
him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage for with
him for their guide and lamp and morning star they were sure to bring
how am i to march unlucky being that i am said sancho when i cant
stir my knee caps for these boards i have bound so tight to my body
wont let me what you must do is carry me in your arms and lay me
across or set me upright in some postern and ill hold it either with
on senor governor cried another it is fear more than the boards
that keeps you from moving make haste stir yourself for there is no
time to lose the enemy is increasing in numbers the shouts grow louder
urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an
attempt to advance but fell to the ground with such a crash that he
fancied he had broken himself all to pieces there he lay like a tortoise
enclosed in its shell or a side of bacon between two kneading troughs
or a boat bottom up on the beach nor did the gang of jokers feel any
compassion for him when they saw him down so far from that
extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the
calls to arms with such energy trampling on poor sancho and slashing at
him over the shield with their swords in such a way that if he had not
gathered himself together and made himself small and drawn in his head
between the shields it would have fared badly with the poor governor
as squeezed into that narrow compass he lay sweating and sweating
again and commending himself with all his heart to god to deliver him
from his present peril some stumbled over him others fell upon him and
one there was who took up a position on top of him for some time and
from thence as if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops shouting
out here our side here the enemy is thickest hold the breach there
shut that gate barricade those ladders here with your stink pots of
pitch and resin and kettles of boiling oil block the streets with
feather beds in short in his ardour he mentioned every little thing
and every implement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a
city is warded off while the bruised and battered sancho who heard and
suffered all was saying to himself o if it would only please the lord
to let the island be lost at once and i could see myself either dead or
out of this torture heaven heard his prayer and when he least expected
it he heard voices exclaiming victory victory the enemy retreats
beaten come senor governor get up and come and enjoy the victory and
divide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of that
lift me up said the wretched sancho in a woebegone voice they helped
him to rise and as soon as he was on his feet said the enemy i have
beaten you may nail to my forehead i dont want to divide the spoils of
the foe i only beg and entreat some friend if i have one to give me a
sup of wine for im parched with thirst and wipe me dry for im
they rubbed him down fetched him wine and unbound the shields and he
seated himself upon his bed and with fear agitation and fatigue he
fainted away those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry
they had pushed it so far however the anxiety his fainting away had
caused them was relieved by his returning to himself he asked what
oclock it was they told him it was just daybreak he said no more and
in silence began to dress himself while all watched him waiting to see
what the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant
he got himself dressed at last and then slowly for he was sorely
bruised and could not go fast he proceeded to the stable followed by
all who were present and going up to dapple embraced him and gave him a
loving kiss on the forehead and said to him not without tears in his
eyes come along comrade and friend and partner of my toils and
sorrows when i was with you and had no cares to trouble me except
mending your harness and feeding your little carcass happy were my
hours my days and my years but since i left you and mounted the
towers of ambition and pride a thousand miseries a thousand troubles
and four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul and all the while
he was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack saddle on the ass
without a word from anyone then having dapple saddled he with great
pain and difficulty got up on him and addressing himself to the
majordomo the secretary the head carver and pedro recio the doctor and
several others who stood by he said make way gentlemen and let me go
back to my old freedom let me go look for my past life and raise myself
up from this present death i was not born to be a governor or protect
islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them ploughing
and digging vinedressing and pruning are more in my way than defending
provinces or kingdoms saint peter is very well at rome i mean each of
us is best following the trade he was born to a reaping hook fits my
hand better than a governors sceptre id rather have my fill of
gazpacho than be subject to the misery of a meddling doctor who me with
hunger and id rather lie in summer under the shade of an oak and in
winter wrap myself in a double sheepskin jacket in freedom than go to
bed between holland sheets and dress in sables under the restraint of a
government god be with your worships and tell my lord the duke that
naked i was born naked i find myself i neither lose nor gain i mean
that without a farthing i came into this government and without a
farthing i go out of it very different from the way governors commonly
leave other islands stand aside and let me go i have to plaster myself
for i believe every one of my ribs is crushed thanks to the enemies that
that is unnecessary senor governor said doctor recio for i will
give your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon make
you as sound and strong as ever and as for your diet i promise your
worship to behave better and let you eat plentifully of whatever you
you spoke late said sancho id as soon turn turk as stay any longer
those jokes wont pass a second time by god id as soon remain in this
government or take another even if it was offered me between two
plates as fly to heaven without wings i am of the breed of the panzas
and they are every one of them obstinate and if they once say odds
odds it must be no matter if it is evens in spite of all the world
here in this stable i leave the ants wings that lifted me up into the
air for the swifts and other birds to eat me and lets take to level
ground and our feet once more and if theyre not shod in pinked shoes of
cordovan they wont want for rough sandals of hemp every ewe to her
like and let no one stretch his leg beyond the length of the sheet
and now let me pass for its growing late with me
to this the majordomo said senor governor we would let your worship go
with all our hearts though it sorely grieves us to lose you for your
wit and christian conduct naturally make us regret you but it is well
known that every governor before he leaves the place where he has been
governing is bound first of all to render an account let your worship
do so for the ten days you have held the government and then you may go
and the peace of god go with you
no one can demand it of me said sancho but he whom my lord the duke
shall appoint i am going to meet him and to him i will render an exact
one besides when i go forth naked as i do there is no other proof
needed to show that i have governed like an angel
by god the great sancho is right said doctor recio and we should let
him go for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him
they all agreed to this and allowed him to go first offering to bear
him company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or for
the journey sancho said he did not want anything more than a little
barley for dapple and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself for the
distance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkier
provant they all embraced him and he with tears embraced all of them
and left them filled with admiration not only at his remarks but at his
which deals with matters relating to this history and no other
the duke and duchess resolved that the challenge don quixote had for the
reason already mentioned given their vassal should be proceeded with
and as the young man was in flanders whither he had fled to escape
having dona rodriguez for a mother in law they arranged to substitute
for him a gascon lacquey named tosilos first of all carefully
instructing him in all he had to do two days later the duke told don
quixote that in four days from that time his opponent would present
himself on the field of battle armed as a knight and would maintain that
the damsel lied by half a beard nay a whole beard if she affirmed that
he had given her a promise of marriage don quixote was greatly pleased
at the news and promised himself to do wonders in the lists and
reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should have offered for
letting his noble hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable
of and so in high spirits and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of
the four days which measured by his impatience seemed spinning
themselves out into four hundred ages let us leave them to pass as we do
other things and go and bear sancho company as mounted on dapple half
glad half sad he paced along on his road to join his master in whose
society he was happier than in being governor of all the islands in the
world well then it so happened that before he had gone a great way from
the island of his government and whether it was island city town or
village that he governed he never troubled himself to inquire he saw
coming along the road he was travelling six pilgrims with staves
foreigners of that sort that beg for alms singing who as they drew near
arranged themselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together
began to sing in their own language something that sancho could not with
the exception of one word which sounded plainly alms from which he
gathered that it was alms they asked for in their song and being as
cide hamete says remarkably charitable he took out of his alforias the
half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with and gave them to
them explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to give them
they received them very gladly but exclaimed geld geld
i dont understand what you want of me good people said sancho
on this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to
sancho by which he comprehended they were asking for money and putting
his thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to
understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him and urging
dapple forward he broke through them but as he was passing one of them
who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him and flinging
his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good spanish god bless
me whats this i see is it possible that i hold in my arms my dear
friend my good neighbour sancho panza but theres no doubt about it
for im not asleep nor am i drunk just now
sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself
embraced by a foreign pilgrim and after regarding him steadily without
speaking he was still unable to recognise him but the pilgrim perceiving
his perplexity cried what and is it possible sancho panza that thou
dost not know thy neighbour ricote the morisco shopkeeper of thy
sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his
features and at last recognised him perfectly and without getting off
the ass threw his arms round his neck saying who the devil could have
known thee ricote in this mummers dress thou art in tell me who bas
frenchified thee and how dost thou dare to return to spain where if
they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with thee
if thou dost not betray me sancho said the pilgrim i am safe for
in this dress no one will recognise me but let us turn aside out of the
road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and rest
and thou shalt eat with them there for they are very good fellows ill
have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened me since i left
our village in obedience to his majestys edict that threatened such
severities against the unfortunate people of my nation as thou hast
sancho complied and ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they
withdrew to the grove they saw turning a considerable distance out of
the road they threw down their staves took off their pilgrims cloaks
and remained in their under clothing they were all good looking young
fellows except ricote who was a man somewhat advanced in years they
carried alforjas all of them and all apparently well filled at least
with things provocative of thirst such as would summon it from two
leagues off they stretched themselves on the ground and making a
tablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread salt knives walnut
scraps of cheese and well picked ham bones which if they were past
gnawing were not past sucking they also put down a black dainty called
they say caviar and made of the eggs of fish a great thirst wakener
nor was there any lack of olives dry it is true and without any
seasoning but for all that toothsome and pleasant but what made the
best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine for
each of them produced his own from his alforjas even the good ricote
who from a morisco had transformed himself into a german or dutchman
took out his which in size might have vied with the five others they
then began to eat with very great relish and very leisurely making the
most of each morsel very small ones of everything they took up on the
point of the knife and then all at the same moment raised their arms and
botas aloft the mouths placed in their mouths and all eyes fixed on
heaven just as if they were taking aim at it and in this attitude they
remained ever so long wagging their heads from side to side as if in
acknowledgment of the pleasure they were enjoying while they decanted the
bowels of the bottles into their own stomachs
sancho beheld all and nothing gave him pain so far from that acting
on the proverb he knew so well when thou art at rome do as thou seest
he asked ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest of them and with
not less enjoyment four times did the botas bear being uplifted but the
fifth it was all in vain for they were drier and more sapless than a
rush by that time which made the jollity that had been kept up so far
every now and then some one of them would grasp sanchos right hand in
his own saying espanoli y tudesqui tuto uno bon compano and sancho
would answer bon compano jur a di and then go off into a fit of
laughter that lasted an hour without a thought for the moment of
anything that had befallen him in his government for cares have very
little sway over us while we are eating and drinking at length the wine
having come to an end with them drowsiness began to come over them and
they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth ricote and sancho
alone remained awake for they had eaten more and drunk less and ricote
drawing sancho aside they seated themselves at the foot of a beech
leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep and without once falling into
his own morisco tongue ricote spoke as follows in pure castilian
thou knowest well neighbour and friend sancho panza how the
proclamation or edict his majesty commanded to be issued against those of
my nation filled us all with terror and dismay me at least it did
insomuch that i think before the time granted us for quitting spain was
out the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon my
children i decided then and i think wisely just like one who knows
that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from him and
looks out beforehand for another to change into i decided i say to
leave the town myself alone and without my family and go to seek out
some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way in
which the others took their departure for i saw very plainly and so did
all the older men among us that the proclamations were not mere threats
as some said but positive enactments which would be enforced at the
appointed time and what made me believe this was what i knew of the base
and extravagant designs which our people harboured designs of such a
nature that i think it was a divine inspiration that moved his majesty to
carry out a resolution so spirited not that we were all guilty for some
there were true and steadfast christians but they were so few that they
could make no head against those who were not and it was not prudent to
cherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house in short it
was with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment
a mild and lenient one in the eyes of some but to us the most terrible
that could be inflicted upon us wherever we are we weep for spain for
after all we were born there and it is our natural fatherland nowhere do
we find the reception our unhappy condition needs and in barbary and all
the parts of africa where we counted upon being received succoured and
welcomed it is there they insult and ill treat us most we knew not our
good fortune until we lost it and such is the longing we almost all of
us have to return to spain that most of those who like myself know the
language and there are many who do come back to it and leave their
wives and children forsaken yonder so great is their love for it and
now i know by experience the meaning of the saying sweet is the love of
i left our village as i said and went to france but though they gave
us a kind reception there i was anxious to see all i could i crossed
into italy and reached germany and there it seemed to me we might live
with more freedom as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to
trifling points everyone lives as he likes for in most parts they enjoy
liberty of conscience i took a house in a town near augsburg and then
joined these pilgrims who are in the habit of coming to spain in great
numbers every year to visit the shrines there which they look upon as
their indies and a sure and certain source of gain they travel nearly
all over it and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of
meat and drink as the saying is and with a real at least in money
and they come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred
crowns saved which changed into gold they smuggle out of the kingdom
either in the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrims
cloaks or by some device of their own and carry to their own country in
spite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched now
my purpose is sancho to carry away the treasure that i left buried
which as it is outside the town i shall be able to do without risk and
to write or cross over from valencia to my daughter and wife who i
know are at algiers and find some means of bringing them to some french
port and thence to germany there to await what it may be gods will to
do with us for after all sancho i know well that ricota my daughter
and francisca ricota my wife are catholic christians and though i am not
so much so still i am more of a christian than a moor and it is always
my prayer to god that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show
me how i am to serve him but what amazes me and i cannot understand is
why my wife and daughter should have gone to barbary rather than to
to this sancho replied remember ricote that may not have been open to
them for juan tiopieyo thy wifes brother took them and being a true
moor he went where he could go most easily and another thing i can tell
thee it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what thou hast
left buried for we heard they took from thy brother in law and thy wife
a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they brought to be
that may be said ricote but i know they did not touch my hoard for
i did not tell them where it was for fear of accidents and so if thou
wilt come with me sancho and help me to take it away and conceal it i
will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve thy
necessities and as thou knowest i know they are many
i would do it said sancho but i am not at all covetous for i gave
up an office this morning in which if i was i might have made the walls
of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months were
over and so for this reason and because i feel i would be guilty of
treason to my king if i helped his enemies i would not go with thee if
instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me four
and what office is this thou hast given up sancho asked ricote
i have given up being governor of an island said sancho and such a
one faith as you wont find the like of easily
where said sancho two leagues from here and it is called the island
nonsense sancho said ricote islands are away out in the sea there
what no islands said sancho i tell thee friend ricote i left it
this morning and yesterday i was governing there as i pleased like a
sagittarius but for all that i gave it up for it seemed to me a
and what hast thou gained by the government asked ricote
i have gained said sancho the knowledge that i am no good for
governing unless it is a drove of cattle and that the riches that are
to be got by these governments are got at the cost of ones rest and
sleep ay and even ones food for in islands the governors must eat
little especially if they have doctors to look after their health
i dont understand thee sancho said ricote but it seems to me all
nonsense thou art talking who would give thee islands to govern is
there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for
governors hold thy peace sancho and come back to thy senses and
consider whether thou wilt come with me as i said to help me to take away
treasure i left buried for indeed it may be called a treasure it is so
large and i will give thee wherewithal to keep thee as i told thee
and i have told thee already ricote that i will not said sancho
let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed and go thy
way in gods name and let me go mine for i know that well gotten gain
may be lost but ill gotten gain is lost itself and its owner likewise
i will not press thee sancho said ricote but tell me wert thou in
our village when my wife and daughter and brother in law left it
i was so said sancho and i can tell thee thy daughter left it
looking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her and
everybody said she was the fairest creature in the world she wept as she
went and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who came
out to see her and she begged them all to commend her to god and our
lady his mother and this in such a touching way that it made me weep
myself though im not much given to tears commonly and faith many a
one would have liked to hide her or go out and carry her off on the
road but the fear of going against the kings command kept them back
the one who showed himself most moved was don pedro gregorio the rich
young heir thou knowest of and they say he was deep in love with her
and since she left he has not been seen in our village again and we all
suspect he has gone after her to steal her away but so far nothing has
i always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my daughter
said ricote but as i felt sure of my ricotas virtue it gave me no
uneasiness to know that he loved her for thou must have heard it said
sancho that the morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the
old christians and my daughter who i fancy thought more of being a
christian than of lovemaking would not trouble herself about the
god grant it said sancho for it would be a bad business for both of
them but now let me be off friend ricote for i want to reach where my
god be with thee brother sancho said ricote my comrades are
beginning to stir and it is time too for us to continue our journey
and then they both embraced and sancho mounted dapple and ricote leant
of what befell sancho on the road and other things that cannot be
the length of time he delayed with ricote prevented sancho from reaching
the dukes castle that day though he was within half a league of it when
night somewhat dark and cloudy overtook him this however as it was
summer time did not give him much uneasiness and he turned aside out of
the road intending to wait for morning but his ill luck and hard fate so
willed it that as he was searching about for a place to make himself as
comfortable as possible he and dapple fell into a deep dark hole that
lay among some very old buildings as he fell he commended himself with
all his heart to god fancying he was not going to stop until he reached
the depths of the bottomless pit but it did not turn out so for at
little more than thrice a mans height dapple touched bottom and he
found himself sitting on him without having received any hurt or damage
whatever he felt himself all over and held his breath to try whether he
was quite sound or had a hole made in him anywhere and finding himself
all right and whole and in perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to
god our lord for the mercy that had been shown him for he made sure he
had been broken into a thousand pieces he also felt along the sides of
the pit with his hands to see if it were possible to get out of it
without help but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold
anywhere at which he was greatly distressed especially when he heard
how pathetically and dolefully dapple was bemoaning himself and no
wonder he complained nor was it from ill temper for in truth he was not
in a very good case alas said sancho what unexpected accidents
happen at every step to those who live in this miserable world who would
have said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne
governor of an island giving orders to his servants and his vassals
would see himself to day buried in a pit without a soul to help him or
servant or vassal to come to his relief here must we perish with hunger
my ass and myself if indeed we dont die first he of his bruises and
injuries and i of grief and sorrow at any rate ill not be as lucky as
my master don quixote of la mancha when he went down into the cave of
that enchanted montesinos where he found people to make more of him than
if he had been in his own house for it seems he came in for a table laid
out and a bed ready made there he saw fair and pleasant visions but
here ill see i imagine toads and adders unlucky wretch that i am
what an end my follies and fancies have come to theyll take up my bones
out of this when it is heavens will that im found picked clean white
and polished and my good dapples with them and by that perhaps it
will be found out who we are at least by such as have heard that sancho
panza never separated from his ass nor his ass from sancho panza
unlucky wretches i say again that our hard fate should not let us die
in our own country and among our own people where if there was no help
for our misfortune at any rate there would be some one to grieve for it
and to close our eyes as we passed away o comrade and friend how ill
have i repaid thy faithful services forgive me and entreat fortune as
well as thou canst to deliver us out of this miserable strait we are
both in and i promise to put a crown of laurel on thy head and make
thee look like a poet laureate and give thee double feeds
in this strain did sancho bewail himself and his ass listened to him
but answered him never a word such was the distress and anguish the poor
beast found himself in at length after a night spent in bitter moanings
and lamentations day came and by its light sancho perceived that it was
wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help and he fell to
bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there was
anyone within hearing but all his shouting was only crying in the
wilderness for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to
hear him and then at last he gave himself up for dead dapple was lying
on his back and sancho helped him to his feet which he was scarcely
able to keep and then taking a piece of bread out of his alforjas which
had shared their fortunes in the fall he gave it to the ass to whom it
was not unwelcome saying to him as if he understood him with bread all
and now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit
a person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass sancho
made for it and entered it by creeping and found it wide and spacious
on the inside which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight that
penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly he
observed too that it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity
seeing which he made his way back to where the ass was and with a stone
began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short time he had
made room for the beast to pass easily and this accomplished taking him
by the halter he proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was
any outlet at the other end he advanced sometimes in the dark
sometimes without light but never without fear god almighty help me
said he to himself this that is a misadventure to me would make a good
adventure for my master don quixote he would have been sure to take
these depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of galiana
and would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment
into some blooming meadow but i unlucky that i am hopeless and
spiritless expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to
open under my feet and swallow me up for good welcome evil if thou
in this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have
travelled rather more than half a league when at last he perceived a dim
light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side showing
that this road which appeared to him the road to the other world led to
here cide hamete leaves him and returns to don quixote who in high
spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the
battle he was to fight with him who had robbed dona rodriguezs daughter
of her honour for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and
injury shamefully done to her it came to pass then that having sallied
forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he would have
to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged in the next
day as he was putting rocinante through his paces or pressing him to the
charge he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for reining him in
tightly it would have been impossible for him to avoid falling into it
he pulled him up however without a fall and coming a little closer
examined the hole without dismounting but as he was looking at it he
heard loud cries proceeding from it and by listening attentively was
able to make out that he who uttered them was saying ho above there
is there any christian that hears me or any charitable gentleman that
will take pity on a sinner buried alive on an unfortunate disgoverned
it struck don quixote that it was the voice of sancho panza he heard
whereat he was taken aback and amazed and raising his own voice as much
as he could he cried out who is below there who is that complaining
who should be here or who should complain was the answer but the
forlorn sancho panza for his sins and for his ill luck governor of the
island of barataria squire that was to the famous knight don quixote of
when don quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his
perturbation grew greater than ever for it suggested itself to his mind
that sancho must be dead and that his soul was in torment down there
and carried away by this idea he exclaimed i conjure thee by everything
that as a catholic christian i can conjure thee by tell me who thou art
and if thou art a soul in torment tell me what thou wouldst have me do
for thee for as my profession is to give aid and succour to those that
need it in this world it will also extend to aiding and succouring the
distressed of the other who cannot help themselves
in that case answered the voice your worship who speaks to me must
be my master don quixote of la mancha nay from the tone of the voice it
don quixote i am replied don quixote he whose profession it is to
aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities wherefore
tell me who thou art for thou art keeping me in suspense because if
thou art my squire sancho panza and art dead since the devils have not
carried thee off and thou art by gods mercy in purgatory our holy
mother the roman catholic church has intercessory means sufficient to
release thee from the pains thou art in and i for my part will plead
with her to that end so far as my substance will go without further
delay therefore declare thyself and tell me who thou art
by all thats good was the answer and by the birth of whomsoever
your worship chooses i swear senor don quixote of la mancha that i am
your squire sancho panza and that i have never died all my life but
that having given up my government for reasons that would require more
time to explain i fell last night into this pit where i am now and
dapple is witness and wont let me lie for more by token he is here with
nor was this all one would have fancied the ass understood what sancho
said because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole cave
famous testimony exclaimed don quixote i know that bray as well as
if i was its mother and thy voice too my sancho wait while i go to the
dukes castle which is close by and i will bring some one to take thee
out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee
go your worship said sancho and come back quick for gods sake for
i cannot bear being buried alive any longer and im dying of fear
don quixote left him and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and
duchess what had happened sancho and they were not a little astonished
at it they could easily understand his having fallen from the
confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there
from time immemorial but they could not imagine how he had quitted the
government without their receiving any intimation of his coming to be
brief they fetched ropes and tackle as the saying is and by dint of
many hands and much labour they drew up dapple and sancho panza out of
the darkness into the light of day a student who saw him remarked
thats the way all bad governors should come out of their governments
as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit dead with hunger
sancho overheard him and said it is eight or ten days brother growler
since i entered upon the government of the island they gave me and all
that time i never had a bellyful of victuals no not for an hour doctors
persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones nor had i any opportunity of
taking bribes or levying taxes and if that be the case as it is i
dont deserve i think to come out in this fashion but man proposes
and god disposes and god knows what is best and what suits each one
best and as the occasion so the behaviour and let nobody say i
wont drink of this water and where one thinks there are flitches
there are no pegs god knows my meaning and thats enough i say no
be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest sancho said don quixote
or there will never be an end of it keep a safe conscience and let them
say what they like for trying to stop slanderers tongues is like trying
to put gates to the open plain if a governor comes out of his government
rich they say he has been a thief and if he comes out poor that he has
theyll be pretty sure this time said sancho to set me down for a
thus talking and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people they reached
the castle where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stood
waiting for them but sancho would not go up to see the duke until he had
first put up dapple in the stable for he said he had passed a very bad
night in his last quarters then he went upstairs to see his lord and
lady and kneeling before them he said because it was your highnesses
