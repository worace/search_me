i have related the substance of several conversations i had with my
master during the greatest part of the time i had the honour to be in his
service but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much more than is
when i had answered all his questions and his curiosity seemed to be
fully satisfied he sent for me one morning early and commanded me to
sit down at some distance an honour which he had never before conferred
upon me he said he had been very seriously considering my whole
story as far as it related both to myself and my country that he looked
upon us as a sort of animals to whose share by what accident he could
not conjecture some small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we made
no other use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural
corruptions and to acquire new ones which nature had not given us that
we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had been
very successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to spend
our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions
that as to myself it was manifest i had neither the strength nor
agility of a common yahoo that i walked infirmly on my hinder feet
had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence and to
remove the hair from my chin which was intended as a shelter from the
sun and the weather lastly that i could neither run with speed nor
climb trees like my brethren as he called them the yahoos in his
that our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our
gross defects in reason and by consequence in virtue because reason
alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature which was therefore
a character we had no pretence to challenge even from the account i had
given of my own people although he manifestly perceived that in order
to favour them i had concealed many particulars and often said the
he was the more confirmed in this opinion because he observed that as
i agreed in every feature of my body with other yahoos except where it
was to my real disadvantage in point of strength speed and activity
the shortness of my claws and some other particulars where nature had no
part so from the representation i had given him of our lives our
manners and our actions he found as near a resemblance in the
disposition of our minds he said the yahoos were known to hate one
another more than they did any different species of animals and the
reason usually assigned was the odiousness of their own shapes which
all could see in the rest but not in themselves he had therefore begun
to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies and by that invention
conceal many of our deformities from each other which would else be
hardly supportable but he now found he had been mistaken and that the
dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause
with ours as i had described them for if said he you throw among
five yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty they will
instead of eating peaceably fall together by the ears each single one
impatient to have all to itself and therefore a servant was usually
employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad and those kept at
home were tied at a distance from each other that if a cow died of age
or accident before a houyhnhnm could secure it for his own yahoos
those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it and then
would ensue such a battle as i had described with terrible wounds made
by their claws on both sides although they seldom were able to kill one
another for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had
invented at other times the like battles have been fought between the
yahoos of several neighbourhoods without any visible cause those of
one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before they
are prepared but if they find their project has miscarried they return
home and for want of enemies engage in what i call a civil war among
that in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of
several colours whereof the yahoos are violently fond and when part
of these stones is fixed in the earth as it sometimes happens they will
dig with their claws for whole days to get them out then carry them
away and hide them by heaps in their kennels but still looking round
with great caution for fear their comrades should find out their
treasure my master said he could never discover the reason of this
unnatural appetite or how these stones could be of any use to a yahoo
but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice
which i had ascribed to mankind that he had once by way of experiment
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his
yahoos had buried it whereupon the sordid animal missing his
treasure by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place
there miserably howled then fell to biting and tearing the rest began
to pine away would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he ordered a
servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole and hide them
as before which when his yahoo had found he presently recovered his
spirits and good humour but took good care to remove them to a better
hiding place and has ever since been a very serviceable brute
my master further assured me which i also observed myself that in the
fields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequent
battles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring
he said it was common when two yahoos discovered such a stone in a
field and were contending which of them should be the proprietor a
third would take the advantage and carry it away from them both which
my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our
suits at law wherein i thought it for our credit not to undeceive him
since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees
among us because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside
the stone they contended for whereas our courts of equity would never
have dismissed the cause while either of them had any thing left
my master continuing his discourse said there was nothing that
rendered the yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetite
to devour every thing that came in their way whether herbs roots
berries the corrupted flesh of animals or all mingled together and it
was peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they could
get by rapine or stealth at a greater distance than much better food
provided for them at home if their prey held out they would eat till
they were ready to burst after which nature had pointed out to them a
certain root that gave them a general evacuation
there was also another kind of root very juicy but somewhat rare and
difficult to be found which the yahoos sought for with much eagerness
and would suck it with great delight it produced in them the same
effects that wine has upon us it would make them sometimes hug and
sometimes tear one another they would howl and grin and chatter and
reel and tumble and then fall asleep in the mud
i did indeed observe that the yahoos were the only animals in this
country subject to any diseases which however were much fewer than
horses have among us and contracted not by any ill treatment they meet
with but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute neither
has their language any more than a general appellation for those
maladies which is borrowed from the name of the beast and called
hnea yahoo or yahoos evil and the cure prescribed is a mixture of
their own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoos throat this i
have since often known to have been taken with success and do here
freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admirable
as to learning government arts manufactures and the like my master
confessed he could find little or no resemblance between the yahoos
of that country and those in ours for he only meant to observe what
parity there was in our natures he had heard indeed some curious
houyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was a sort of ruling
yahoo as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in
a park who was always more deformed in body and mischievous in
disposition than any of the rest that this leader had usually a
favourite as like himself as he could get whose employment was to lick
his masters feet and posteriors and drive the female yahoos to his
kennel for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of asss
flesh this favourite is hated by the whole herd and therefore to
protect himself keeps always near the person of his leader he usually
continues in office till a worse can be found but the very moment he is
discarded his successor at the head of all the yahoos in that
district young and old male and female come in a body and discharge
their excrements upon him from head to foot but how far this might be
applicable to our courts and favourites and ministers of state my
i durst make no return to this malicious insinuation which debased human
understanding below the sagacity of a common hound who has judgment
enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack
my master told me there were some qualities remarkable in the yahoos
which he had not observed me to mention or at least very slightly in
the accounts i had given of humankind he said those animals like
other brutes had their females in common but in this they differed
that the she yahoo would admit the males while she was pregnant and
that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as fiercely as
with each other both which practices were such degrees of infamous
brutality as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at
another thing he wondered at in the yahoos was their strange
disposition to nastiness and dirt whereas there appears to be a natural
love of cleanliness in all other animals as to the two former
accusations i was glad to let them pass without any reply because i had
not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species which otherwise i
certainly had done from my own inclinations but i could have easily
vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last
article if there had been any swine in that country as unluckily for me
there were not which although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a
yahoo cannot i humbly conceive in justice pretend to more
cleanliness and so his honour himself must have owned if he had seen
their filthy way of feeding and their custom of wallowing and sleeping
my master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had
discovered in several yahoos and to him was wholly unaccountable he
said a fancy would sometimes take a yahoo to retire into a corner to
lie down and howl and groan and spurn away all that came near him
although he were young and fat wanted neither food nor water nor did
the servant imagine what could possibly ail him and the only remedy
they found was to set him to hard work after which he would infallibly
come to himself to this i was silent out of partiality to my own kind
yet here i could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen which only
seizes on the lazy the luxurious and the rich who if they were forced
to undergo the same regimen i would undertake for the cure
his honour had further observed that a female yahoo would often stand
behind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young males passing by and then
appear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which time
it was observed that she had a most offensive smell and when any of the
males advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with a
counterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where she
at other times if a female stranger came among them three or four of
her own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin and
smell her all over and then turn off with gestures that seemed to
perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations which he
had drawn from what he observed himself or had been told him by others
however i could not reflect without some amazement and much sorrow
that the rudiments of lewdness coquetry censure and scandal should
i expected every moment that my master would accuse the yahoos of those
unnatural appetites in both sexes so common among us but nature it
seems has not been so expert a school mistress and these politer
pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of
the author relates several particulars of the yahoos the great
virtues of the houyhnhnms the education and exercise of their youth
as i ought to have understood human nature much better than i supposed it
possible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character he
gave of the yahoos to myself and my countrymen and i believed i could
yet make further discoveries from my own observation i therefore often
begged his honour to let me go among the herds of yahoos in the
neighbourhood to which he always very graciously consented being
perfectly convinced that the hatred i bore these brutes would never
suffer me to be corrupted by them and his honour ordered one of his
servants a strong sorrel nag very honest and good natured to be my
guard without whose protection i durst not undertake such adventures
for i have already told the reader how much i was pestered by these
odious animals upon my first arrival and i afterwards failed very
narrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches when i
happened to stray at any distance without my hanger and i have reason
to believe they had some imagination that i was of their own species
which i often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves and showing my
naked arms and breasts in their sight when my protector was with me at
which times they would approach as near as they durst and imitate my
actions after the manner of monkeys but ever with great signs of hatred
as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild
ones when he happens to be got among them
they are prodigiously nimble from their infancy however i once caught
a young male of three years old and endeavoured by all marks of
tenderness to make it quiet but the little imp fell a squalling and
scratching and biting with such violence that i was forced to let it
go and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones came about us at
the noise but finding the cub was safe for away it ran and my sorrel
nag being by they durst not venture near us i observed the young
animals flesh to smell very rank and the stink was somewhat between a
weasel and a fox but much more disagreeable i forgot another
circumstance and perhaps i might have the readers pardon if it were
wholly omitted that while i held the odious vermin in my hands it
voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my
clothes but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by where i
washed myself as clean as i could although i durst not come into my
by what i could discover the yahoos appear to be the most unteachable
of all animals their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or
carry burdens yet i am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from a
perverse restive disposition for they are cunning malicious
treacherous and revengeful they are strong and hardy but of a
cowardly spirit and by consequence insolent abject and cruel it is
observed that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and
mischievous than the rest whom yet they much exceed in strength and
the houyhnhnms keep the yahoos for present use in huts not far from
the house but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields where they dig
up roots eat several kinds of herbs and search about for carrion or
sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs a sort of wild rat which they
greedily devour nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their
nails on the side of a rising ground wherein they lie by themselves
only the kennels of the females are larger sufficient to hold two or
they swim from their infancy like frogs and are able to continue long
under water where they often take fish which the females carry home to
their young and upon this occasion i hope the reader will pardon my
being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weather
exceeding hot i entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near
he consented and i immediately stripped myself stark naked and went
down softly into the stream it happened that a young female yahoo
standing behind a bank saw the whole proceeding and inflamed by desire
as the nag and i conjectured came running with all speed and leaped
into the water within five yards of the place where i bathed i was
never in my life so terribly frightened the nag was grazing at some
distance not suspecting any harm she embraced me after a most fulsome
manner i roared as loud as i could and the nag came galloping towards
me whereupon she quitted her grasp with the utmost reluctancy and
leaped upon the opposite bank where she stood gazing and howling all the
this was a matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as of
mortification to myself for now i could no longer deny that i was a
real yahoo in every limb and feature since the females had a natural
propensity to me as one of their own species neither was the hair of
this brute of a red colour which might have been some excuse for an
appetite a little irregular but black as a sloe and her countenance
did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind
for i think she could not be above eleven years old
having lived three years in this country the reader i suppose will
expect that i should like other travellers give him some account of the
manners and customs of its inhabitants which it was indeed my principal
as these noble houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a general
disposition to all virtues and have no conceptions or ideas of what is
evil in a rational creature so their grand maxim is to cultivate
reason and to be wholly governed by it neither is reason among them a
point problematical as with us where men can argue with plausibility on
both sides of the question but strikes you with immediate conviction as
it must needs do where it is not mingled obscured or discoloured by
passion and interest i remember it was with extreme difficulty that i
could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion or
how a point could be disputable because reason taught us to affirm or
deny only where we are certain and beyond our knowledge we cannot do
either so that controversies wranglings disputes and positiveness
in false or dubious propositions are evils unknown among the
houyhnhnms in the like manner when i used to explain to him our
several systems of natural philosophy he would laugh that a creature
pretending to reason should value itself upon the knowledge of other
peoples conjectures and in things where that knowledge if it were
certain could be of no use wherein he agreed entirely with the
sentiments of socrates as plato delivers them which i mention as the
highest honour i can do that prince of philosophers i have often since
reflected what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of
europe and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned
friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the
houyhnhnms and these not confined to particular objects but universal
to the whole race for a stranger from the remotest part is equally
treated with the nearest neighbour and wherever he goes looks upon
himself as at home they preserve decency and civility in the highest
degrees but are altogether ignorant of ceremony they have no fondness
for their colts or foals but the care they take in educating them
proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason and i observed my master
to show the same affection to his neighbours issue that he had for his
own they will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole
species and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons where
when the matron houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex they no
longer accompany with their consorts except they lose one of their issue
by some casualty which very seldom happens but in such a case they meet
again or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past
bearing some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts and then
go together again until the mother is pregnant this caution is
necessary to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers
but the race of inferior houyhnhnms bred up to be servants is not so
strictly limited upon this article these are allowed to produce three of
each sex to be domestics in the noble families
in their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colours as
will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed strength is chiefly
valued in the male and comeliness in the female not upon the account of
love but to preserve the race from degenerating for where a female
happens to excel in strength a consort is chosen with regard to
courtship love presents jointures settlements have no place in their
thoughts or terms whereby to express them in their language the young
couple meet and are joined merely because it is the determination of
their parents and friends it is what they see done every day and they
look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being but
the violation of marriage or any other unchastity was never heard of
and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual
benevolence that they bear to all others of the same species who come in
their way without jealousy fondness quarrelling or discontent
in educating the youth of both sexes their method is admirable and
highly deserves our imitation these are not suffered to taste a grain
of oats except upon certain days till eighteen years old nor milk but
very rarely and in summer they graze two hours in the morning and as
many in the evening which their parents likewise observe but the
servants are not allowed above half that time and a great part of their
grass is brought home which they eat at the most convenient hours when
temperance industry exercise and cleanliness are the lessons equally
enjoined to the young ones of both sexes and my master thought it
monstrous in us to give the females a different kind of education from
the males except in some articles of domestic management whereby as he
truly observed one half of our natives were good for nothing but
bringing children into the world and to trust the care of our children
to such useless animals he said was yet a greater instance of
but the houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength speed and
hardiness by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills
and over hard stony grounds and when they are all in a sweat they are
ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river four times a
year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in
running and leaping and other feats of strength and agility where the
victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise on this festival
the servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay and
oats and milk for a repast to the houyhnhnms after which these
brutes are immediately driven back again for fear of being noisome to
every fourth year at the vernal equinox there is a representative
council of the whole nation which meets in a plain about twenty miles
from our house and continues about five or six days here they inquire
into the state and condition of the several districts whether they
abound or be deficient in hay or oats or cows or yahoos and wherever
there is any want which is but seldom it is immediately supplied by
unanimous consent and contribution here likewise the regulation of
children is settled as for instance if a houyhnhnm has two males he
changes one of them with another that has two females and when a child
has been lost by any casualty where the mother is past breeding it is
determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the
a grand debate at the general assembly of the houyhnhnms and how it
was determined the learning of the houyhnhnms their buildings
their manner of burials the defectiveness of their language
one of these grand assemblies was held in my time about three months
before my departure whither my master went as the representative of our
district in this council was resumed their old debate and indeed the
only debate that ever happened in their country whereof my master after
his return give me a very particular account
the question to be debated was whether the yahoos should be
exterminated from the face of the earth one of the members for the
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight
alleging that as the yahoos were the most filthy noisome and
deformed animals which nature ever produced so they were the most
restive and indocible mischievous and malicious they would privately
suck the teats of the houyhnhnms cows kill and devour their cats
trample down their oats and grass if they were not continually watched
and commit a thousand other extravagancies he took notice of a general
tradition that yahoos had not been always in their country but that
many ages ago two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain
whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime or
from the ooze and froth of the sea was never known that these yahoos
engendered and their brood in a short time grew so numerous as to
overrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnms to get rid of
this evil made a general hunting and at last enclosed the whole herd
and destroying the elder every houyhnhnm kept two young ones in a
kennel and brought them to such a degree of tameness as an animal so
savage by nature can be capable of acquiring using them for draught and
carriage that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition and that
those creatures could not be yinhniamshy or aborigines of the land
because of the violent hatred the houyhnhnms as well as all other
animals bore them which although their evil disposition sufficiently
deserved could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been
aborigines or else they would have long since been rooted out that
the inhabitants taking a fancy to use the service of the yahoos had
very imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of asses which are a
comely animal easily kept more tame and orderly without any offensive
smell strong enough for labour although they yield to the other in
agility of body and if their braying be no agreeable sound it is far
preferable to the horrible howlings of the yahoos
several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose when my
master proposed an expedient to the assembly whereof he had indeed
borrowed the hint from me he approved of the tradition mentioned by
the honourable member who spoke before and affirmed that the two
yahoos said to be seen first among them had been driven thither over
the sea that coming to land and being forsaken by their companions
they retired to the mountains and degenerating by degrees became in
process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the
country whence these two originals came the reason of this assertion
was that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful yahoo
meaning myself which most of them had heard of and many of them had
seen he then related to them how he first found me that my body was
all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other
animals that i spoke in a language of my own and had thoroughly learned
theirs that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thither
that when he saw me without my covering i was an exact yahoo in every
part only of a whiter colour less hairy and with shorter claws he
added how i had endeavoured to persuade him that in my own and other
countries the yahoos acted as the governing rational animal and held
the houyhnhnms in servitude that he observed in me all the qualities
of a yahoo only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason
which however was in a degree as far inferior to the houyhnhnm race
as the yahoos of their country were to me that among other things i
mentioned a custom we had of castrating houyhnhnms when they were
young in order to render them tame that the operation was easy and
safe that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes as industry is
taught by the ant and building by the swallow for so i translate the
word lyhannh although it be a much larger fowl that this invention
might be practised upon the younger yahoos here which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use would in an age put an end
to the whole species without destroying life that in the mean time the
houyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses which
as they are in all respects more valuable brutes so they have this
advantage to be fit for service at five years old which the others are
this was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what
passed in the grand council but he was pleased to conceal one
particular which related personally to myself whereof i soon felt the
unhappy effect as the reader will know in its proper place and whence i
date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life
the houyhnhnms have no letters and consequently their knowledge is all
traditional but there happening few events of any moment among a people
so well united naturally disposed to every virtue wholly governed by
reason and cut off from all commerce with other nations the historical
part is easily preserved without burdening their memories i have
already observed that they are subject to no diseases and therefore can
have no need of physicians however they have excellent medicines
composed of herbs to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or
frog of the foot by sharp stones as well as other maims and hurts in
they calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon but use no
subdivisions into weeks they are well enough acquainted with the
motions of those two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipses
and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy
in poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals wherein the
justness of their similes and the minuteness as well as exactness of
their descriptions are indeed inimitable their verses abound very much
in both of these and usually contain either some exalted notions of
friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in
races and other bodily exercises their buildings although very rude
and simple are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them from
all injuries of cold and heat they have a kind of tree which at forty
years old loosens in the root and falls with the first storm it grows
very straight and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone for the
houyhnhnms know not the use of iron they stick them erect in the
ground about ten inches asunder and then weave in oat straw or
sometimes wattles between them the roof is made after the same manner
the houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof of
their fore foot as we do our hands and this with greater dexterity than
i could at first imagine i have seen a white mare of our family thread
a needle which i lent her on purpose with that joint they milk their
cows reap their oats and do all the work which requires hands in the
same manner they have a kind of hard flints which by grinding against
other stones they form into instruments that serve instead of wedges
axes and hammers with tools made of these flints they likewise cut
their hay and reap their oats which there grow naturally in several
fields the yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages and the servants
tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain which is kept in
stores they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels and bake
if they can avoid casualties they die only of old age and are buried in
the obscurest places that can be found their friends and relations
expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure nor does the dying
person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world any more
than if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his
neighbours i remember my master having once made an appointment with a
friend and his family to come to his house upon some affair of
importance on the day fixed the mistress and her two children came very
late she made two excuses first for her husband who as she said
happened that very morning to shnuwnh the word is strongly expressive
in their language but not easily rendered into english it signifies
to retire to his first mother her excuse for not coming sooner was
that her husband dying late in the morning she was a good while
consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be
laid and i observed she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as
the rest she died about three months after
they live generally to seventy or seventy five years very seldom to
fourscore some weeks before their death they feel a gradual decay but
without pain during this time they are much visited by their friends
because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction
however about ten days before their death which they seldom fail in
computing they return the visits that have been made them by those who
are nearest in the neighbourhood being carried in a convenient sledge
drawn by yahoos which vehicle they use not only upon this occasion
but when they grow old upon long journeys or when they are lamed by any
accident and therefore when the dying houyhnhnms return those visits
they take a solemn leave of their friends as if they were going to some
remote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of their
i know not whether it may be worth observing that the houyhnhnms have
no word in their language to express any thing that is evil except what
they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the yahoos thus
they denote the folly of a servant an omission of a child a stone that
cuts their feet a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather and the
like by adding to each the epithet of yahoo for instance hhnm
yahoo whnaholm yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and an ill contrived
i could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and
virtues of this excellent people but intending in a short time to
publish a volume by itself expressly upon that subject i refer the
reader thither and in the mean time proceed to relate my own sad
the authors economy and happy life among the houyhnhnms his great
improvement in virtue by conversing with them their conversations the
author has notice given him by his master that he must depart from the
country he falls into a swoon for grief but submits he contrives and
finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow servant and puts to sea at a
i had settled my little economy to my own hearts content my master had
ordered a room to be made for me after their manner about six yards
from the house the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay and
covered with rush mats of my own contriving i had beaten hemp which
there grows wild and made of it a sort of ticking this i filled with
the feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of yahoos
hairs and were excellent food i had worked two chairs with my knife
the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part when
my clothes were worn to rags i made myself others with the skins of
rabbits and of a certain beautiful animal about the same size called
nnuhnoh the skin of which is covered with a fine down of these i
also made very tolerable stockings i soled my shoes with wood which i
cut from a tree and fitted to the upper leather and when this was worn
out i supplied it with the skins of yahoos dried in the sun i often
got honey out of hollow trees which i mingled with water or ate with my
bread no man could more verify the truth of these two maxims that
nature is very easily satisfied and that necessity is the mother of
invention i enjoyed perfect health of body and tranquillity of mind
i did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend nor the injuries
of a secret or open enemy i had no occasion of bribing flattering or
pimping to procure the favour of any great man or of his minion i
wanted no fence against fraud or oppression here was neither physician
to destroy my body nor lawyer to ruin my fortune no informer to watch
my words and actions or forge accusations against me for hire here were
virtuosos no leaders or followers of party and faction no encouragers
to vice by seducement or examples no dungeon axes gibbets

i had the favour of being admitted to several houyhnhnms who came to
visit or dine with my master where his honour graciously suffered me to
wait in the room and listen to their discourse both he and his company
would often descend to ask me questions and receive my answers i had
also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others
i never presumed to speak except in answer to a question and then i did
it with inward regret because it was a loss of so much time for
improving myself but i was infinitely delighted with the station of an
humble auditor in such conversations where nothing passed but what was
useful expressed in the fewest and most significant words where as i
have already said the greatest decency was observed without the least
degree of ceremony where no person spoke without being pleased himself
and pleasing his companions where there was no interruption
tediousness heat or difference of sentiments they have a notion that
when people are met together a short silence does much improve
conversation this i found to be true for during those little
intermissions of talk new ideas would arise in their minds which very
much enlivened the discourse their subjects are generally on
friendship and benevolence on order and economy sometimes upon the
visible operations of nature or ancient traditions upon the bounds and
limits of virtue upon the unerring rules of reason or upon some
determinations to be taken at the next great assembly and often upon the
various excellences of poetry i may add without vanity that my
presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse because it
afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of
me and my country upon which they were all pleased to descant in a
manner not very advantageous to humankind and for that reason i shall
not repeat what they said only i may be allowed to observe that his
honour to my great admiration appeared to understand the nature of
yahoos much better than myself he went through all our vices and
follies and discovered many which i had never mentioned to him by only
supposing what qualities a yahoo of their country with a small
proportion of reason might be capable of exerting and concluded with
too much probability how vile as well as miserable such a creature
i freely confess that all the little knowledge i have of any value was
acquired by the lectures i received from my master and from hearing the
discourses of him and his friends to which i should be prouder to
listen than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe i
admired the strength comeliness and speed of the inhabitants and such
a constellation of virtues in such amiable persons produced in me the
highest veneration at first indeed i did not feel that natural awe
which the yahoos and all other animals bear toward them but it grew
upon me by decrees much sooner than i imagined and was mingled with a
respectful love and gratitude that they would condescend to distinguish
when i thought of my family my friends my countrymen or the human race
in general i considered them as they really were yahoos in shape and
disposition perhaps a little more civilized and qualified with the gift
of speech but making no other use of reason than to improve and
multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the
share that nature allotted them when i happened to behold the
reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain i turned away my face in
horror and detestation of myself and could better endure the sight of a
common yahoo than of my own person by conversing with the
houyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight i fell to imitate their
gait and gesture which is now grown into a habit and my friends often
tell me in a blunt way that i trot like a horse which however i
take for a great compliment neither shall i disown that in speaking i
am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the houyhnhnms and hear
myself ridiculed on that account without the least mortification
in the midst of all this happiness and when i looked upon myself to be
fully settled for life my master sent for me one morning a little
earlier than his usual hour i observed by his countenance that he was
in some perplexity and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak
after a short silence he told me he did not know how i would take what
he was going to say that in the last general assembly when the affair
of the yahoos was entered upon the representatives had taken offence
at his keeping a yahoo meaning myself in his family more like a
houyhnhnm than a brute animal that he was known frequently to converse
with me as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company
that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature or a thing
ever heard of before among them the assembly did therefore exhort him
either to employ me like the rest of my species or command me to swim
back to the place whence i came that the first of these expedients was
utterly rejected by all the houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his
house or their own for they alleged that because i had some rudiments
of reason added to the natural pravity of those animals it was to be
feared i might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous
parts of the country and bring them in troops by night to destroy the
houyhnhnms cattle as being naturally of the ravenous kind and averse
my master added that he was daily pressed by the houyhnhnms of the
neighbourhood to have the assemblys exhortation executed which he could
not put off much longer he doubted it would be impossible for me to
swim to another country and therefore wished i would contrive some sort
of vehicle resembling those i had described to him that might carry me
on the sea in which work i should have the assistance of his own
servants as well as those of his neighbours he concluded that for
his own part he could have been content to keep me in his service as
long as i lived because he found i had cured myself of some bad habits
and dispositions by endeavouring as far as my inferior nature was
i should here observe to the reader that a decree of the general
assembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn which
signifies an exhortation as near as i can render it for they have no
conception how a rational creature can be compelled but only advised or
exhorted because no person can disobey reason without giving up his
i was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my masters discourse
and being unable to support the agonies i was under i fell into a swoon
at his feet when i came to myself he told me that he concluded i had
been dead for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of
nature i answered in a faint voice that death would have been too
great a happiness that although i could not blame the assemblys
exhortation or the urgency of his friends yet in my weak and corrupt
judgment i thought it might consist with reason to have been less
rigorous that i could not swim a league and probably the nearest land
to theirs might be distant above a hundred that many materials
necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off were wholly wanting
in this country which however i would attempt in obedience and
gratitude to his honour although i concluded the thing to be impossible
and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils
for supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure how
could i think with temper of passing my days among yahoos and
relapsing into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise houyhnhnms were founded not
to be shaken by arguments of mine a miserable yahoo and therefore
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants
assistance in making a vessel and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched
being and if ever i returned to england was not without hopes of being
useful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the renowned
houyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind
my master in a few words made me a very gracious reply allowed me the
space of two months to finish my boat and ordered the sorrel nag my
fellow servant for so at this distance i may presume to call him to
follow my instruction because i told my master that his help would be
sufficient and i knew he had a tenderness for me
in his company my first business was to go to that part of the coast
where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore i got upon a
height and looking on every side into the sea fancied i saw a small
island toward the north east i took out my pocket glass and could then
clearly distinguish it above five leagues off as i computed but it
appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud for as he had no
conception of any country beside his own so he could not be as expert in
distinguishing remote objects at sea as we who so much converse in that
after i had discovered this island i considered no further but resolved
it should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving the
i returned home and consulting with the sorrel nag we went into a copse
at some distance where i with my knife and he with a sharp flint
fastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden handle cut
down several oak wattles about the thickness of a walking staff and
some larger pieces but i shall not trouble the reader with a particular
description of my own mechanics let it suffice to say that in six weeks
time with the help of the sorrel nag who performed the parts that
required most labour i finished a sort of indian canoe but much larger
covering it with the skins of yahoos well stitched together with
hempen threads of my own making my sail was likewise composed of the
skins of the same animal but i made use of the youngest i could get the
older being too tough and thick and i likewise provided myself with four
paddles i laid in a stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls and
took with me two vessels one filled with milk and the other with water
i tried my canoe in a large pond near my masters house and then
corrected in it what was amiss stopping all the chinks with yahoos
tallow till i found it staunch and able to bear me and my freight and
when it was as complete as i could possibly make it i had it drawn on a
carriage very gently by yahoos to the sea side under the conduct of
when all was ready and the day came for my departure i took leave of my
master and lady and the whole family my eyes flowing with tears and my
heart quite sunk with grief but his honour out of curiosity and
perhaps if i may speak without vanity partly out of kindness was
determined to see me in my canoe and got several of his neighbouring
friends to accompany him i was forced to wait above an hour for the
tide and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the
island to which i intended to steer my course i took a second leave of
my master but as i was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof he
did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth i am not ignorant how
much i have been censured for mentioning this last particular
detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious a
person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a
creature so inferior as i neither have i forgotten how apt some
travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received
but if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and
courteous disposition of the houyhnhnms they would soon change their
i paid my respects to the rest of the houyhnhnms in his honours
company then getting into my canoe i pushed off from shore
the authors dangerous voyage he arrives at new holland hoping to
settle there is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives is seized
and carried by force into a portuguese ship the great civilities of the
i began this desperate voyage on february 15 1714 15 at nine oclock in
the morning the wind was very favourable however i made use at first
only of my paddles but considering i should soon be weary and that the
wind might chop about i ventured to set up my little sail and thus
with the help of the tide i went at the rate of a league and a half an
hour as near as i could guess my master and his friends continued on
the shore till i was almost out of sight and i often heard the sorrel
nag who always loved me crying out hnuy illa nyha majah yahoo
my design was if possible to discover some small island uninhabited
yet sufficient by my labour to furnish me with the necessaries of life
which i would have thought a greater happiness than to be first minister
in the politest court of europe so horrible was the idea i conceived of
returning to live in the society and under the government of yahoos
for in such a solitude as i desired i could at least enjoy my own
thoughts and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable
houyhnhnms without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and
the reader may remember what i related when my crew conspired against
me and confined me to my cabin how i continued there several weeks
without knowing what course we took and when i was put ashore in the
long boat how the sailors told me with oaths whether true or false
that they knew not in what part of the world we were however i did
then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the cape of good
hope or about 45 degrees southern latitude as i gathered from some
general words i overheard among them being i supposed to the south east
in their intended voyage to madagascar and although this were little
better than conjecture yet i resolved to steer my course eastward
hoping to reach the south west coast of new holland and perhaps some
such island as i desired lying westward of it the wind was full west
and by six in the evening i computed i had gone eastward at least
eighteen leagues when i spied a very small island about half a league
off which i soon reached it was nothing but a rock with one creek
naturally arched by the force of tempests here i put in my canoe and
climbing a part of the rock i could plainly discover land to the east
extending from south to north i lay all night in my canoe and
repeating my voyage early in the morning i arrived in seven hours to the
south east point of new holland this confirmed me in the opinion i have
long entertained that the maps and charts place this country at least
three degrees more to the east than it really is which thought i
communicated many years ago to my worthy friend mr herman moll and
gave him my reasons for it although he has rather chosen to follow other
i saw no inhabitants in the place where i landed and being unarmed i
was afraid of venturing far into the country i found some shellfish on
the shore and ate them raw not daring to kindle a fire for fear of
being discovered by the natives i continued three days feeding on
oysters and limpets to save my own provisions and i fortunately found a
brook of excellent water which gave me great relief
on the fourth day venturing out early a little too far i saw twenty or
thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me they
were stark naked men women and children round a fire as i could
discover by the smoke one of them spied me and gave notice to the
rest five of them advanced toward me leaving the women and children at
the fire i made what haste i could to the shore and getting into my
canoe shoved off the savages observing me retreat ran after me and
before i could get far enough into the sea discharged an arrow which
wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee i shall carry the mark
to my grave i apprehended the arrow might be poisoned and paddling out
of the reach of their darts being a calm day i made a shift to suck
the wound and dress it as well as i could
i was at a loss what to do for i durst not return to the same
landing place but stood to the north and was forced to paddle for the
wind though very gentle was against me blowing north west as i was
looking about for a secure landing place i saw a sail to the
north north east which appearing every minute more visible i was in
some doubt whether i should wait for them or not but at last my
detestation of the yahoo race prevailed and turning my canoe i sailed
and paddled together to the south and got into the same creek whence i
set out in the morning choosing rather to trust myself among these
barbarians than live with european yahoos i drew up my canoe as
close as i could to the shore and hid myself behind a stone by the
little brook which as i have already said was excellent water
the ship came within half a league of this creek and sent her long boat
with vessels to take in fresh water for the place it seems was very
well known but i did not observe it till the boat was almost on shore
and it was too late to seek another hiding place the seamen at their
landing observed my canoe and rummaging it all over easily conjectured
that the owner could not be far off four of them well armed searched
every cranny and lurking hole till at last they found me flat on my face
behind the stone they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth
dress my coat made of skins my wooden soled shoes and my furred
stockings whence however they concluded i was not a native of the
place who all go naked one of the seamen in portuguese bid me rise
and asked who i was i understood that language very well and getting
upon my feet said i was a poor yahoo banished from the houyhnhnms
and desired they would please to let me depart they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue and saw by my complexion i must be a
european but were at a loss to know what i meant by yahoos and
houyhnhnms and at the same time fell a laughing at my strange tone in
speaking which resembled the neighing of a horse i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred i again desired leave to depart and was
gently moving to my canoe but they laid hold of me desiring to know
what country i was of whence i came with many other questions i
told them i was born in england whence i came about five years ago and
then their country and ours were at peace i therefore hoped they would
not treat me as an enemy since i meant them no harm but was a poor
yahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his
when they began to talk i thought i never heard or saw any thing more
unnatural for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should
speak in england or a yahoo in houyhnhnmland the honest portuguese
were equally amazed at my strange dress and the odd manner of delivering
my words which however they understood very well they spoke to me
with great humanity and said they were sure the captain would carry me
gratis to lisbon whence i might return to my own country that two of
the seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what they had
seen and receive his orders in the mean time unless i would give my
solemn oath not to fly they would secure me by force i thought it best
to comply with their proposal they were very curious to know my story
but i gave them very little satisfaction and they all conjectured that
my misfortunes had impaired my reason in two hours the boat which went
laden with vessels of water returned with the captains command to
fetch me on board i fell on my knees to preserve my liberty but all
was in vain and the men having tied me with cords heaved me into the
boat whence i was taken into the ship and thence into the captains
his name was pedro de mendez he was a very courteous and generous
person he entreated me to give some account of myself and desired to
know what i would eat or drink said i should be used as well as
himself and spoke so many obliging things that i wondered to find such
civilities from a yahoo however i remained silent and sullen i was
ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men at last i desired
something to eat out of my own canoe but he ordered me a chicken and
some excellent wine and then directed that i should be put to bed in a
very clean cabin i would not undress myself but lay on the
bed clothes and in half an hour stole out when i thought the crew was
at dinner and getting to the side of the ship was going to leap into
the sea and swim for my life rather than continue among yahoos but
one of the seamen prevented me and having informed the captain i was
after dinner don pedro came to me and desired to know my reason for so
desperate an attempt assured me he only meant to do me all the service
he was able and spoke so very movingly that at last i descended to
