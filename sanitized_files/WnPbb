starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the
look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long
fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped
the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope
farther to the left to the very place where they were standing the
angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly
like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from
side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a cry
like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang
helter skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel
bushes parted behind the hounds and daniels chestnut horse appeared
dark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward capless
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face
ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the count
blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count
youve let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to say
more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving
flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had
aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished
schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win simons sympathy for
his plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by the
bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head
the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so
nicholas rostov meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf by
the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whose
notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmen
approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the
copse he knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had
separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and
that something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come his way any
moment he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from
what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it hope
alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god that
the wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate and
shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
arising from trivial causes what would it be to thee to do this for
me he said to god i know thou art great and that it is a sin to ask
this of thee but for gods sake do let the old wolf come my way and let
karay spring at it in sight of uncle who is watching from over there
and seize it by the throat in a death grip a thousand times during
that half hour rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of
the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth
and the gully with its water worn side and uncles cap just visible
no i shant have such luck thought rostov yet what wouldnt it be
worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am always
unlucky memories of austerlitz and of dolokhov flashed rapidly and
clearly through his mind only once in my life to get an old wolf i
want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the
left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of
again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
the deserted field no it cant be thought rostov taking a deep
breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for the
height of happiness was reached and so simply without warning or
noise or display that rostov could not believe his eyes and remained
in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
a gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back and
big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no
one saw her rostov holding his breath looked round at the borzois
they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation
old karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs
ulyulyulyu whispered rostov pouting his lips the borzois jumped up
jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears karay finished
scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quivering
tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down
shall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf
approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolfs whole
physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never
seen before human eyes fixed upon her and turning her head a little
back or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to
herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
ulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accord
his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head
off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholas
did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see the
borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who
increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow
the first to come into view was milka with her black markings and
powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now she
was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and instead
of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tail
the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang impetuously
at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped
aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again rose
and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all
the borzois who did not get any closer to her
shell get away no its impossible thought nicholas still shouting
karay ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who
was now his only hope karay with all the strength age had left him
stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily
aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolfs lope and the
borzois slower pace made it plain that karay had miscalculated
nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the
wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him
he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf
there was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did
not know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in
front and almost knocked her over but the wolf jumped up more quickly
than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at the
yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the
ground bleeding from a gash in its side
thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfs path the old
dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of
it as if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on karay tucked
her tail yet further between her legs and increased her speed but here
nicholas only saw that something happened to karay the borzoi was
suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just in
that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with
the dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her ears
laid back karay was pinning her by the throat was the happiest moment
of his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to dismount
and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that
mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully she
clicked her teeth karay no longer had her by the throat leaped with a
movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengaged
herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward karay
his hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded climbed with
oh my god why nicholas cried in despair
uncles huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolfs
path and his borzois once more stopped the animals advance she was
nicholas and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were all
riding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to
dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward
again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
already at the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuing
had rushed out from the wood he saw karay seize the wolf and checked
his horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that the
horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
safety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight
toward the wood just as karay had run to cut the animal off as a
result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut breathing
heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniel
lying on the wolfs back among the dogs trying to seize her by the
ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself
that all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
tried to rise but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little took
a step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on the
wolf seizing her by the ears nicholas was about to stab her but
daniel whispered dont well gag her and changing his position
set his foot on the wolfs neck a stick was thrust between her jaws and
she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were bound
together and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side
with happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying
and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her
to the place where they were all to meet the hounds had killed two of
the cubs and the borzois three the huntsmen assembled with their booty
and their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with her
broad browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws
gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
her when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
yet simply at everybody old count rostov also rode up and touched the
oh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he asked
yes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing his cap
the count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count
for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable
the old count went home and natasha and petya promised to return very
soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they
put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees
nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips
facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosed
before nicholas heard one he knew voltorn giving tongue at intervals
other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue a
moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine
he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself
the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and
nicholas saw a queer short legged red fox with a fine brush going hard
across the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close to
the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois
formed a star shaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with
tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up
to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat
whats this thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he is not
the huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping
it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood
near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved their
arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of
a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight
thats ilagins huntsman having a row with our ivan said nicholas
nicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to him and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together
several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on
nicholas dismounted and with natasha and petya who had ridden up
stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of
the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his
young master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at a
distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was
pale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was black
but he probably was not even aware of it
a likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my gray
bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox i
gave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a taste
of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably
nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and petya to
wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys ilagins hunting
the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there
the facts were that ilagin with whom the rostovs had a quarrel and were
at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostovs and
had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the rostovs
were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased
nicholas though he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence of
moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his
arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe he
rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a
beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven black horse
instead of an enemy nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courteous
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young counts
acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised his beaver cap
and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man
punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone elses
borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited
natasha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had
followed him in some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
greetings she rode up to them ilagin lifted his beaver cap still
higher to natasha and said with a pleasant smile that the young
countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
to expiate his huntsmans offense ilagin pressed the rostovs to come to
an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and
which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the hunt now
the way to iligins upland was across the fields the hunt servants fell
into line the masters rode together uncle rostov and ilagin kept
stealthily glancing at one anothers dogs trying not to be observed by
their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois
rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small pure bred red
spotted bitch on ilagins leash slender but with muscles like steel a
delicate muzzle and prominent black eyes he had heard of the swiftness
of ilagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own
in the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the years
harvest nicholas pointed to the red spotted bitch
a fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone is she swift
that one yes shes a good dog gets what shes after answered
ilagin indifferently of the red spotted bitch erza for which a year
before he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so in
your parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of count he went on
continuing the conversation they had begun and considering it polite to
return the young counts compliment ilagin looked at his borzois and
picked out milka who attracted his attention by her breadth that
black spotted one of yours is fine well shaped said he
yes shes fast enough replied nicholas and thought if only a
full grown hare would cross the field now id show you what sort of
borzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a ruble
i dont understand continued ilagin how some sportsmen can be so
jealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count i enjoy
riding in company such as this what could be better he again
raised his cap to natasha but as for counting skins and what one
or being upset because someone elses borzoi and not mine catches
something all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not so
a tu came the long drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers in who
had halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloft
and again repeated his long drawn cry a tu this call and the
uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare
ah he has found one i think said ilagin carelessly yes we must
ride up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing in erza
and uncles red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of
pitting against his own borzois and suppose they outdo my milka at
once he thought as he rode with uncle and ilagin toward the hare
a full grown one asked ilagin as he approached the whip who had
sighted the hare and not without agitation he looked round and whistled
and you michael nikanorovich he said addressing uncle
the latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face
how can i join in why youve given a village for each of your
borzois thats it come on yours are worth thousands try yours
against one another you two and ill look on
rugay hey hey he shouted rugayushka he added involuntarily by
this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this
red borzoi natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and
her brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by it
the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off on
the horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not the
gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately
how is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward the
but before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming
next morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rushed
downhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the hunt
who had been moving slowly shouted stop calling in the hounds
while the borzoi whips with a cry of a tu galloped across the field
setting the borzois on the hare the tranquil ilagin nicholas natasha
and uncle flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only the
borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant
of the chase the hare they had started was a strong and swift one when
he jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his ears listening to
the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once he
took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gain on him
and finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger laid
back his ears and rushed off headlong he had been lying in the stubble
but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the
two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the
nearest were the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone far
before ilagins red spotted erza passed them got within a length flew
at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut and thinking
she had seized him rolled over like a ball the hare arched his back
and bounded off yet more swiftly from behind erza rushed the broad
haunched black spotted milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare
milashka dear rose nicholas triumphant cry it looked as if milka
would immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and flew
past the hare had squatted again the beautiful erza reached him but
when close to the hares scut paused as if measuring the distance so as
not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg
erza darling ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own erza did not
hearken to his appeal at the very moment when she would have seized her
prey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye
and the stubble again erza and milka were abreast running like a pair
of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was easier
for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so
rugay rugayushka thats it come on came a third voice just then
and uncles red borzoi straining and curving its back caught up with
the two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless of the
terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off the balk
onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking to
his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddying
his back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois surrounded
him a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs only
the delighted uncle dismounted and cut off a pad shaking the hare
for the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round with restless
eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without himself knowing
whom to or what about thats it come on thats a dog there it
has beaten them all the thousand ruble as well as the one ruble
borzois thats it come on said he panting and looking wrathfully
around as if he were abusing someone as if they were all his enemies
and had insulted him and only now had he at last succeeded in
justifying himself there are your thousand ruble ones thats it
rugay heres a pad for you he said throwing down the hares muddy
pad youve deserved it thats it come on
shed tired herself out shed run it down three times by herself
said nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he
but what is there in running across it like that said ilagins groom
once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it
ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his
excitement at the same moment natasha without drawing breath screamed
joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set everyones ear
tingling by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all
talking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have been
ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it
at any other time uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly
and smartly across his horses back as if by that gesture he meant to
rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone
mounted his bay and rode off the others all followed dispirited and
shamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their former
affectation of indifference for a long time they continued to look at
red rugay who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring
of his leash walked along just behind uncles horse with the serene
well i am like any other dog as long as its not a question of
coursing but when it is then look out his appearance seemed to
when much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking to him
he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle deigned to
toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they were
so far from home that he accepted uncles offer that the hunting party
should spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna
and if you put up at my house that will be better still thats it
come on said uncle you see its damp weather and you could rest
and the little countess could be driven home in a trap
uncles offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a
trap while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to uncles house
some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front
porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as
well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
the hunters who were arriving the presence of natasha a woman a lady
and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree
that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed
by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy
on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said
arinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt
dangles see shes got a little hunting horn
how is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of all
uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood
in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his
retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natasha off her horse and taking
her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the house
with its bare unplastered log walls was not overclean it did not seem
that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but neither was it
noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples
uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a
folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvorov of
the hosts father and mother and of himself in military uniform the
study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors to
sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room
rugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the
sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study
was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen
from behind this came womens laughter and whispers natasha nicholas
and petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa petya leaning
on his elbow fell asleep at once natasha and nicholas were silent
their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at
one another now that the hunt was over and they were in the house
nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority
over his sister natasha gave him a wink and neither refrained long
from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a
after a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers and
small top boots and natasha felt that this costume the very one she
had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the right
thing and not at all worse than a swallow tail or frock coat uncle
too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brothers and
sisters laughter it could never enter his head that they might be
laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merriment
thats right young countess thats it come on i never saw anyone
like her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with
a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that had been
cut short shes ridden all day like a man and is as fresh as ever
soon after uncles reappearance the door was opened evidently from
the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy good looking woman of
about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a
large loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance
and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant
smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional stoutness which
caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head
this woman who was uncles housekeeper trod very lightly she went
to the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly
took from it the bottles and various hors doeuvres and dishes and
arranged them on the table when she had finished she stepped aside and
stopped at the door with a smile on her face here i am i am she now
do you understand uncle her expression said to rostov how could one
help understanding not only nicholas but even natasha understood the
meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that
slightly puckered his lips when anisya fedorovna entered on the tray
was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms
rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and
sparkling mead apples nuts raw and roasted and nut and honey
sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves
made with honey and preserves made with sugar
all this was the fruit of anisya fedorovnas housekeeping gathered and
prepared by her the smell and taste of it all had a smack of anisya
fedorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and
take this little lady countess she kept saying as she offered
natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honey and nut sweets or such
a chicken anywhere anisya fedorovna left the room
after supper over their cherry brandy rostov and uncle talked of
past and future hunts of rugay and ilagins dogs while natasha sat
upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried several
times to wake petya that he might eat something but he only muttered
incoherent words without waking up natasha felt so lighthearted and
happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would
come for her too soon after a casual pause such as often occurs when
receiving friends for the first time in ones own house uncle
answering a thought that was in his visitors minds said
this you see is how i am finishing my days death will come thats
it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone
uncles face was very significant and even handsome as he said this
involuntarily rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from
his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province uncle had
the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks
they called him in to decide family disputes chose him as executor
confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice and to other posts
but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the
autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in
winter and lying in his overgrown garden in summer
i did once but gave it up i am not fit for it thats it come on i
cant make head or tail of it thats for you i havent brains enough
now hunting is another matter thats it come on open the door
there he shouted why have you shut it
the door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmens room as they
there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the
door into the huntsmens room from which came the clear sounds of a
balalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was
playing natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and
now went out into the passage to hear better
thats mitka my coachman i have got him a good balalayka im fond
it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmens room
when uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of such music
how good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional
superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
very good said natasha reproachfully noticing her brothers tone
just as uncles pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemed
to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemed
more please more cried natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka
ceased mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalayka
to the air of my lady with trills and variations uncle sat
listening slightly smiling with his head on one side the air was
repeated a hundred times the balalayka was retuned several times and
the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow weary
of it and wished to hear it again and again anisya fedorovna came in
and leaned her portly person against the doorpost
you like listening she said to natasha with a smile extremely like
uncles thats a good player of ours she added
he doesnt play that part right said uncle suddenly with an
energetic gesture here he ought to burst out thats it come on
anisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i havent
touched it for a long time thats it come on ive given it up
anisya fedorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her
without looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping the
case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in his
armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his
left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at
anisya fedorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then
quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not
my lady but the well known song came a maiden down the street the
tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the
hearts of nicholas and natasha arousing in them the same kind of sober
mirth as radiated from anisya fedorovnas whole being anisya fedorovna
flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the
room uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energetic
firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot
where anisya fedorovna had just stood something seemed to be laughing a
little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially as
the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there as
he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap
lovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted natasha as soon as he had
finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas nicholas
she said turning to her brother as if asking him what is it moves me
nicholas too was greatly pleased by uncles playing and uncle
played the piece over again anisya fedorovnas smiling face reappeared
in the doorway and behind hers other faces
fetching water clear and sweet stop dear maiden i entreat
played uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the
strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders
go on uncle dear natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life
uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of them
smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a
naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance
now then niece he exclaimed waving to natasha the hand that had
natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face
uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
where how and when had this young countess educated by an emigree
french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit
and obtained that manner which the pas de chale  would one would have
supposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements were
those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had expected
of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantly
proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized
nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an
she did the right thing with such precision such complete precision
that anisya fedorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she
watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was in
anisya and in anisyas father and mother and aunt and in every russian
well little countess thats it come on cried uncle with a
joyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fine
young fellow must be found as husband for you thats it come on
oh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at natasha who
and such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new train
of thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile mean
when he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is as if he
thought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety but
he would understand it all where is he now she thought and her face
suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dont dare to
think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly
beside uncle begging him to play something more
uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he cleared
his throat and sang his favorite hunting song
as twas growing dark last night fell the snow so soft and light
uncle sang as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that the
whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of
itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists
only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered
tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natasha was in
ecstasies over uncles singing she resolved to give up learning the
harp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his guitar and
at once found the chords of the song
after nine oclock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to
look for them arrived to fetch natasha and petya the count and
countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of
petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
traps natasha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped natasha
up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness he
accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed
so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride
good bye dear niece his voice called out of the darkness not the
voice natasha had known previously but the one that had sung as twas
in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
what a darling uncle is said natasha when they had come out onto the
no im quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answered
natasha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long
while the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but
only heard them splashing through the unseen mud
what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all
find place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she
suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last night the tune
of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught
what were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natasha
they were fond of asking one another that question
i said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i thought
that rugay the red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man he
would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for his
manner what a good fellow uncle is dont you think so well and
i wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving along
and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we are
really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly find
that we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and then i thought no
i know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as natasha
no said natasha though she had in reality been thinking about prince
andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have liked
uncle and then i was saying to myself all the way how well anisya
carried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happy
ringing laughter and do you know she suddenly said i know that i
shall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am now
rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought how
charming this natasha of mine is i have no other friend like her and
never shall have why should she marry we might always drive about
what a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natasha
ah there are still lights in the drawing room she said pointing to
the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
count ilya rostov had resigned the position of marshal of the nobility
because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs did
not improve natasha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferring
together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the
fine ancestral rostov house and estate near moscow it was not necessary
to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal and life at
otradnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous house
and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to
table every day these were all their own people who had settled down in
the house almost as members of the family or persons who were it
seemed obliged to live in the counts house such were dimmler the
musician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his family belova
an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such as
petyas tutors the girls former governess and other people who simply
found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the counts house
than at home they had not as many visitors as before but the old
habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive
of existence remained unchanged there was still the hunting
establishment which nicholas had even enlarged the same fifty horses
and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents and
dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the
counts games of whist and boston at which spreading out his cards so
that everybody could see them he let himself be plundered of hundreds
of rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity to
play a rubber with count rostov as a most profitable source of income
the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe
that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and
feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
patiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt
that her children were being ruined that it was not the counts fault
for he could not help being what he was that though he tried to hide
it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his
childrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position
from her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namely
for nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to be their last
hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him she
would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right this match
was with julie karagina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents
a girl the rostovs had known from childhood and who had now become a
wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers
the countess had written direct to julies mother in moscow suggesting a
marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from
her karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and
everything depend on her daughters inclination she invited nicholas to
several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that
now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him
married she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
were accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
and tried to discover what he thought about marriage
at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow
during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his mothers
remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced
her to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of getting
their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karagina
but mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect
me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he
asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and only
no you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to
justify herself you have not understood me nikolenka it is your
happiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling an
untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry
mamma dont cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i will
give my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i would
but the countess did not want the question put like that she did not
want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice
no you have not understood me dont let us talk about it she
maybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i to
sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma could
speak so to me because sonya is poor i must not love her he thought
must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainly
be happier with her than with some doll like julie i can always
sacrifice my feelings for my familys welfare he said to himself but
i cant coerce my feelings if i love sonya that feeling is for me
nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the
conversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes
with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
the portionless sonya though she blamed herself for it she could not
refrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya often pulling her up
without reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using the
formal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her the
kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sonya because that poor
dark eyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful to
her benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly in
love with nicholas that there were no grounds for finding fault with
nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter had
come from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that he would have
been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till
the beginning of the new year natasha was still as much in love with
her betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as
ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at
the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
of depression which she could not master she felt sorry for herself
sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to anyone
while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved
things were not cheerful in the rostovs home
