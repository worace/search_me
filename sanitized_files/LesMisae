the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on
the table stop he resumed as though he had not quite understood
thats not it did you hear i am a galley slave a convict i come
from the galleys he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow
paper which he unfolded heres my passport yellow as you see this
serves to expel me from every place where i go will you read it i know
how to read i learned in the galleys there is a school there for those
who choose to learn hold this is what they put on this passport jean
valjean discharged convict native of that is nothing to you has
been nineteen years in the galleys five years for house breaking
and burglary fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four
occasions he is a very dangerous man there every one has cast me
out are you willing to receive me is this an inn will you give me
something to eat and a bed have you a stable
madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the
bed in the alcove we have already explained the character of the two
sit down sir and warm yourself we are going to sup in a few moments
and your bed will be prepared while you are supping
at this point the man suddenly comprehended the expression of his face
up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction
of doubt of joy and became extraordinary he began stammering like a
really what you will keep me you do not drive me forth a convict
you call me sir you do not address me as thou get out of here you
dog is what people always say to me i felt sure that you would expel
me so i told you at once who i am oh what a good woman that was who
directed me hither i am going to sup a bed with a mattress and sheets
like the rest of the world a bed it is nineteen years since i have
slept in a bed you actually do not want me to go you are good
people besides i have money i will pay well pardon me monsieur the
inn keeper but what is your name i will pay anything you ask you are
a fine man you are an inn keeper are you not
i am replied the bishop a priest who lives here
a priest said the man oh what a fine priest then you are not
going to demand any money of me you are the cure are you not the cure
of this big church well i am a fool truly i had not perceived your
as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner
replaced his passport in his pocket and seated himself mademoiselle
you are humane monsieur le cure you have not scorned me a good
priest is a very good thing then you do not require me to pay
no said the bishop keep your money how much have you did you not
one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous and how long did it take you
the man continued i have still the whole of my money in four days i
have spent only twenty five sous which i earned by helping unload some
wagons at grasse since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a
chaplain in the galleys and one day i saw a bishop there monseigneur
is what they call him he was the bishop of majore at marseilles he is
the cure who rules over the other cures you understand pardon me
i say that very badly but it is such a far off thing to me you
understand what we are he said mass in the middle of the galleys on an
altar he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head it glittered
in the bright light of midday we were all ranged in lines on the three
sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us we could not see
very well he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear that
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had
madame magloire returned she brought a silver fork and spoon which she
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire
as possible and turning to his guest the night wind is harsh on the
each time that he uttered the word sir in his voice which was so gently
grave and polished the mans face lighted up monsieur to a convict is
like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa ignominy
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver
candlesticks from the chimney piece in monseigneurs bed chamber and
monsieur le cure said the man you are good you do not despise me
you receive me into your house you light your candles for me yet i
have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate
the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand you
could not help telling me who you were this is not my house it is
the house of jesus christ this door does not demand of him who enters
whether he has a name but whether he has a grief you suffer you are
hungry and thirsty you are welcome and do not thank me do not say
that i receive you in my house no one is at home here except the man
who needs a refuge i say to you who are passing by that you are much
more at home here than i am myself everything here is yours what need
have i to know your name besides before you told me you had one which
yes replied the bishop you are called my brother
stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man i was very hungry when
i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has
oh the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat
cold toil the convicts the thrashings the double chain for nothing
the cell for one word even sick and in bed still the chain dogs dogs
are happier nineteen years i am forty six now there is the yellow
yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place
listen there will be more joy in heaven over the tear bathed face of a
repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men if you
emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against
mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of
good will and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with
water oil bread and salt a little bacon a bit of mutton figs a
fresh cheese and a large loaf of rye bread she had of her own accord
added to the bishops ordinary fare a bottle of his old mauves wine
the bishops face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is
peculiar to hospitable natures to table he cried vivaciously as was
his custom when a stranger supped with him he made the man sit on his
right mademoiselle baptistine perfectly peaceable and natural took
the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to
his custom the man began to eat with avidity
all at once the bishop said it strikes me there is something missing
madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forks and
spoons which were absolutely necessary now it was the usage of the
house when the bishop had any one to supper to lay out the whole
six sets of silver on the table cloth an innocent ostentation this
graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of childs play which was full
of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty into
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word
and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by
the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before
chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of pontarlier
now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we cannot
do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle
baptistines letters to madame boischevron wherein the conversation
between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious
   this man paid no attention to any one he ate with the voracity
of a starving man however after supper he said
monsieur le cure of the good god all this is far too good for me but
i must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep
between ourselves the remark rather shocked me my brother replied
no returned the man they have more money you are poor i see that
plainly you cannot be even a curate are you really a cure ah if the
good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure
the good god is more than just said my brother
monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarlier that you are going
i think that is what the man said then he went on
i must be on my way by daybreak to morrow travelling is hard if the
you are going to a good country said my brother during the
revolution my family was ruined i took refuge in franche comte at
first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands my will
was good i found plenty to occupy me one has only to choose there are
paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories
on a large scale steel mills copper works twenty iron foundries at
least four of which situated at lods at chatillon at audincourt and
i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my
brother mentioned then he interrupted himself and addressed me
have we not some relatives in those parts my dear sister
we did have some among others m de lucenet who was captain of the
yes resumed my brother but in 93 one had no longer any
relatives one had only ones arms i worked they have in the
country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean a
truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister it is their
then my brother while urging the man to eat explained to him with
great minuteness what these fruitieres of pontarlier were that they
were divided into two classes the big barns which belong to the rich
and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to
eight thousand cheeses each summer and the associated fruitieres which
belong to the poor these are the peasants of mid mountain who hold
their cows in common and share the proceeds they engage the services
of a cheese maker whom they call the grurin the grurin receives the
milk of the associates three times a day and marks the quantity on
a double tally it is towards the end of april that the work of the
cheese dairies begins it is towards the middle of june that the
cheese makers drive their cows to the mountains
the man recovered his animation as he ate my brother made him drink
that good mauves wine which he does not drink himself because he says
that wine is expensive my brother imparted all these details with that
easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his
words with graceful attentions to me he recurred frequently to that
comfortable trade of grurin as though he wished the man to understand
without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him
a refuge one thing struck me this man was what i have told you well
neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother
utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when
he entered which could remind the man of what he was nor of what my
brother was to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him
a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a
mark of the passage might remain behind this might have appeared to any
one else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance
to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him
some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little
commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the
future my brother did not even ask him from what country he came
nor what was his history for in his history there is a fault and my
brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it to such
a point did he carry it that at one time when my brother was speaking
of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise a gentle labor near
heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he
stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him
something which might wound the man by dint of reflection i think
i have comprehended what was passing in my brothers heart he was
thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his
misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best thing
was to divert him from it and to make him believe if only momentarily
that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his
ordinary way is not this indeed to understand charity well is there
not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which
abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions and is not the
truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all it has
seemed to me that this might have been my brothers private thought in
any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he
gave no sign of them from beginning to end even to me he was the same
as he is every evening and he supped with this jean valjean with the
same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m
gedeon le provost or with the curate of the parish
towards the end when he had reached the figs there came a knock at
the door it was mother gerbaud with her little one in her arms my
brother kissed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i
had about me to give to mother gerbaud the man was not paying much
heed to anything then he was no longer talking and he seemed very much
fatigued after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure my brother
said grace then he turned to the man and said to him you must be
in great need of your bed madame magloire cleared the table very
promptly i understood that we must retire in order to allow this
traveller to go to sleep and we both went up stairs nevertheless i
sent madame magloire down a moment later to carry to the mans bed a
goat skin from the black forest which was in my room the nights are
frigid and that keeps one warm it is a pity that this skin is old all
the hair is falling out my brother bought it while he was in germany
at tottlingen near the sources of the danube as well as the little
ivory handled knife which i use at table
madame magloire returned immediately we said our prayers in the
drawing room where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to
our own chambers without saying a word to each other
after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of
the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his
monsieur i will conduct you to your room
as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was
so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was
situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bishops
at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was
putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed
this was her last care every evening before she went to bed
the bishop installed his guest in the alcove a fresh white bed had been
prepared there the man set the candle down on a small table
well said the bishop may you pass a good night to morrow morning
before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows
hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a
sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would
have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it
even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at
that moment did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace
was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure
even to himself he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and
bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice
ah really you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this
he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something
have you really reflected well how do you know that i have not been an
that is the concern of the good god
then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking
to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his
benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head or
looking behind him he returned to his bedroom
when the alcove was in use a large serge curtain drawn from wall to
wall concealed the altar the bishop knelt before this curtain as he
passed and said a brief prayer a moment later he was in his garden
walking meditating contemplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed
in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the
as for the man he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit
by the nice white sheets snuffing out his candle with his nostrils
after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon
the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep
midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment
a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house
towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke
jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie he had not learned
to read in his childhood when he reached mans estate he became a
tree pruner at faverolles his mother was named jeanne mathieu his
father was called jean valjean or vlajean probably a sobriquet and a
jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which
constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures on the whole
however there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about
jean valjean in appearance at least he had lost his father and mother
at a very early age his mother had died of a milk fever which had not
been properly attended to his father a tree pruner like himself had
been killed by a fall from a tree all that remained to jean valjean
was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and
girls this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a
husband she lodged and fed her young brother
the husband died the eldest of the seven children was eight years old
jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year he took the
fathers place and in his turn supported the sister who had brought
him up this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly
on the part of jean valjean thus his youth had been spent in rude and
ill paid toil he had never known a kind woman friend in his native
parts he had not had the time to fall in love
he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word
his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from
his bowl while he was eating a bit of meat a slice of bacon the
heart of the cabbage to give to one of her children as he went on
eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup his
long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes he had the air
of perceiving nothing and allowing it there was at faverolles not
far from the valjean thatched cottage on the other side of the lane
a farmers wife named marie claude the valjean children habitually
famished sometimes went to borrow from marie claude a pint of milk in
their mothers name which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley
corner snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little
girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks if their mother
had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents
severely jean valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid marie claude for
the pint of milk behind their mothers back and the children were not
in pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day then he hired out as
a hay maker as laborer as neat herd on a farm as a drudge he did
whatever he could his sister worked also but what could she do with
seven little children it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was
being gradually annihilated a very hard winter came jean had no work
the family had no bread no bread literally seven children
one sunday evening maubert isabeau the baker on the church square at
faverolles was preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on
the grated front of his shop he arrived in time to see an arm passed
through a hole made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the
glass the arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off isabeau ran
out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs isabeau ran
after him and stopped him the thief had flung away the loaf but his
arm was still bleeding it was jean valjean
this took place in 1795 jean valjean was taken before the tribunals
of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at
night he had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world
he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case there exists a
legitimate prejudice against poachers the poacher like the smuggler
smacks too strongly of the brigand nevertheless we will remark
cursorily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the
hideous assassin of the towns the poacher lives in the forest the
smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea the cities make ferocious
men because they make corrupt men the mountain the sea the forest
make savage men they develop the fierce side but often without
jean valjean was pronounced guilty the terms of the code were explicit
there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when
the penal laws decree a shipwreck what an ominous minute is that in
which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment
of a sentient being jean valjean was condemned to five years in the
on the 22d of april 1796 the victory of montenotte won by the
general in chief of the army of italy whom the message of the directory
to the five hundred of the 2d of floreal year iv calls buona parte
was announced in paris on that same day a great gang of galley slaves
was put in chains at bicetre jean valjean formed a part of that gang
an old turnkey of the prison who is now nearly eighty years old still
recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of
the fourth line in the north angle of the courtyard he was seated on
the ground like the others he did not seem to comprehend his position
except that it was horrible it is probable that he also was
disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man ignorant of
everything something excessive while the bolt of his iron collar was
being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer he wept
his tears stifled him they impeded his speech he only managed to
say from time to time i was a tree pruner at faverolles then still
sobbing he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times
as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights
and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done
whatever it was he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing
he set out for toulon he arrived there after a journey of twenty seven
days on a cart with a chain on his neck at toulon he was clothed in
the red cassock all that had constituted his life even to his name
was effaced he was no longer even jean valjean he was number 24601
what became of his sister what became of the seven children who
troubled himself about that what becomes of the handful of leaves from
the young tree which is sawed off at the root
it is always the same story these poor living beings these creatures
of god henceforth without support without guide without refuge
wandered away at random who even knows each in his own direction
perhaps and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which
engulfs solitary destinies gloomy shades into which disappear in
succession so many unlucky heads in the sombre march of the human race
they quitted the country the clock tower of what had been their village
forgot them the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them
after a few years residence in the galleys jean valjean himself forgot
them in that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar
that is all only once during all the time which he spent at toulon
did he hear his sister mentioned this happened i think towards
the end of the fourth year of his captivity i know not through what
channels the news reached him some one who had known them in their
own country had seen his sister she was in paris she lived in a poor
street rear saint sulpice in the rue du gindre she had with her only
one child a little boy the youngest where were the other six perhaps
she did not know herself every morning she went to a printing office
no 3 rue du sabot where she was a folder and stitcher she was obliged
to be there at six oclock in the morning long before daylight in
winter in the same building with the printing office there was a
school and to this school she took her little boy who was seven years
old but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only
opened at seven the child had to wait in the courtyard for the school
to open for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air they
would not allow the child to come into the printing office because he
was in the way they said when the workmen passed in the morning they
beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement overcome with
drowsiness and often fast asleep in the shadow crouched down and
doubled up over his basket when it rained an old woman the portress
took pity on him she took him into her den where there was a pallet a
spinning wheel and two wooden chairs and the little one slumbered in a
corner pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from
cold at seven oclock the school opened and he entered that is what
they talked to him about it for one day it was a moment a flash
as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those
things whom he had loved then all closed again he heard nothing more
forever nothing from them ever reached him again he never beheld
them he never met them again and in the continuation of this mournful
history they will not be met with any more
towards the end of this fourth year jean valjeans turn to escape
arrived his comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place
he escaped he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty if being
at liberty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at
the slightest noise to be afraid of everything of a smoking roof
of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking
clock of the day because one can see of the night because one cannot
see of the highway of the path of a bush of sleep on the evening
of the second day he was captured he had neither eaten nor slept for
thirty six hours the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime
to a prolongation of his term for three years which made eight years
in the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again he availed himself
of it but could not accomplish his flight fully he was missing at
roll call the cannon were fired and at night the patrol found him
hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction he
resisted the galley guards who seized him escape and rebellion this
case provided for by a special code was punished by an addition of
five years two of them in the double chain thirteen years in the
tenth year his turn came round again he again profited by it he
succeeded no better three years for this fresh attempt sixteen years
finally i think it was during his thirteenth year he made a last
attempt and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four
hours of absence three years for those four hours nineteen years in
october 1815 he was released he had entered there in 1796 for having
broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread
room for a brief parenthesis this is the second time during his
studies on the penal question and damnation by law that the author of
this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of
departure for the disaster of a destiny claude gueux had stolen a loaf
jean valjean had stolen a loaf english statistics prove the fact that
four thefts out of five in london have hunger for their immediate cause
jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged
impassive he had entered in despair he emerged gloomy
it is necessary that society should look at these things because it is
he was as we have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool the
light of nature was ignited in him unhappiness which also possesses a
clearness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight
which existed in this mind beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in
the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun of the galleys upon the
plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own consciousness and
he recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly
punished he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy
act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to
him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to
wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that
it is not an unanswerable argument to say can one wait when one is
hungry that in the first place it is very rare for any one to die of
hunger literally and next that fortunately or unfortunately man
is so constituted that he can suffer long and much both morally and
physically without dying that it is therefore necessary to have
patience that that would even have been better for those poor little
children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable
unfortunate wretch to take society at large violently by the collar
and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft that that
is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through
which infamy enters in short that he was in the wrong
whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history whether
it was not a serious thing that he a laborer out of work that he an
industrious man should have lacked bread and whether the fault once
committed and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and
disproportioned whether there had not been more abuse on the part of
the law in respect to the penalty than there had been on the part
of the culprit in respect to his fault whether there had not been an
excess of weights in one balance of the scale in the one which contains
expiation whether the over weight of the penalty was not equivalent
to the annihilation of the crime and did not result in reversing the
situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the
repression of converting the guilty man into the victim and the debtor
into the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the
whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravations for
attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage
perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of society against
the individual a crime which was being committed afresh every day a
he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its
members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack
of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to
seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess a default of
whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those
of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods
made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration
these questions put and answered he judged society and condemned it
he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said
to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call
it to account he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium
between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done
to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was
not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous
anger may be both foolish and absurd one can be irritated wrongfully
one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on ones side
and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never
seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls justice and
which it shows to those whom it strikes men had only touched him to
bruise him every contact with them had been a blow never since
his infancy since the days of his mother of his sister had he ever
encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance from suffering to
suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a
war and that in this war he was the conquered he had no other weapon
than his hate he resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away
there was at toulon a school for the convicts kept by the ignorantin
friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the
unfortunate men who had a mind for them he was of the number who had
a mind he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read
to write to cipher he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to
fortify his hate in certain cases education and enlightenment can
this is a sad thing to say after having judged society which had
caused his unhappiness he judged providence which had made society
thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and
at the same time fell light entered it on one side and darkness on the
jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature he was still good
when he arrived at the galleys he there condemned society and felt
that he was becoming wicked he there condemned providence and was
it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point
does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom can the
man created good by god be rendered wicked by man can the soul be
completely made over by fate and become evil fate being evil can
the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and
infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness
as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault is there not in every
human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a
first spark a divine element incorruptible in this world immortal in
the other which good can develop fan ignite and make to glow with
splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish
grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist
would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had
he beheld at toulon during the hours of repose which were for jean
valjean hours of revery this gloomy galley slave seated with folded
arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into
his pocket to prevent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful
a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by
certainly and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact the
observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery he
would perchance have pitied this sick man of the laws making but
he would not have even essayed any treatment he would have turned aside
his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within
this soul and like dante at the portals of hell he would have effaced
from this existence the word which the finger of god has nevertheless
inscribed upon the brow of every man hope
was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as
perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for
those who read us did jean valjean distinctly perceive after their
formation and had he seen distinctly during the process of their
formation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed had
this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of
the succession of ideas through which he had by degrees mounted and
descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for so many years formed
the inner horizon of his spirit was he conscious of all that passed
within him and of all that was working there that is something
which we do not presume to state it is something which we do not even
believe there was too much ignorance in jean valjean even after his
misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there at
times he did not rightly know himself what he felt jean valjean was in
the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows one
might have said that he hated in advance of himself he dwelt habitually
in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer only at
intervals there suddenly came to him from without and from within an
access of wrath a surcharge of suffering a livid and rapid flash which
illuminated his whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around
him in front behind amid the gleams of a frightful light the hideous
precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny
the flash passed the night closed in again and where was he he no
longer knew the peculiarity of pains of this nature in which
that which is pitiless that is to say that which is
brutalizing predominates is to transform a man little by little by
a sort of stupid transfiguration into a wild beast sometimes into a
jean valjeans successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone
suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul
jean valjean would have renewed these attempts utterly useless and
foolish as they were as often as the opportunity had presented itself
without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experiences
which he had already gone through he escaped impetuously like the wolf
who finds his cage open instinct said to him flee reason would have
said remain but in the presence of so violent a temptation reason
vanished nothing remained but instinct the beast alone acted when
he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to
one detail which we must not omit is that he possessed a physical
strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the
galleys at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean
valjean was worth four men he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous
weights on his back and when the occasion demanded it he replaced that
implement which is called a jack screw and was formerly called orgueil
pride whence we may remark in passing is derived the name of the
rue montorgueil near the halles fishmarket in paris his comrades had
nicknamed him jean the jack screw once when they were repairing the
balcony of the town hall at toulon one of those admirable caryatids of
puget which support the balcony became loosened and was on the point
of falling jean valjean who was present supported the caryatid with
his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive
his suppleness even exceeded his strength certain convicts who were
forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force
and skill combined it is the science of muscles an entire system of
mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners men who are forever
envious of the flies and birds to climb a vertical surface and to find
points of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to
jean valjean an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his
back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness
of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story he
sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison
he spoke but little he laughed not at all an excessive emotion was
required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh
of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon to all
appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of
athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed
intelligence he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was
resting on him in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled
each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance
he perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful
accumulation of things collecting and mounting above him beyond the
range of his vision laws prejudices men and deeds whose outlines
escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than
that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization he distinguished
here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now
afar off and on inaccessible table lands some group some detail
vividly illuminated here the galley sergeant and his cudgel there the
gendarme and his sword yonder the mitred archbishop away at the top
like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling it seemed to him
that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered
it more funereal and more black all this laws prejudices deeds men
things went and came above him over his head in accordance with the
complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization
walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness
in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference souls which have
fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the
lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks the reproved of
the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for
him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon
in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature
if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts it would
doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought
all these things realities full of spectres phantasmagories full of
realities had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which
at times amid his convict toil he paused he fell to thinking his
reason at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore
rose in revolt everything which had happened to him seemed to him
absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible he said
to himself it is a dream he gazed at the galley sergeant standing a
few paces from him the galley sergeant seemed a phantom to him all of
a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel
visible nature hardly existed for him it would almost be true to say
that there existed for jean valjean neither sun nor fine summer days
nor radiant sky nor fresh april dawns i know not what vent hole
to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated
into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will
confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen
years jean valjean the inoffensive tree pruner of faverolles the
formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner
in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action
firstly of evil action which was rapid unpremeditated dashing
entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which
he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave
consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which
such a misfortune can furnish his deliberate deeds passed through
three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone
traverse reasoning will perseverance he had for moving causes his
habitual wrath bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities
suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the
just if there are any such the point of departure like the point
of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred
which if it be not arrested in its development by some providential
incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then
the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which
manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to
some living being no matter whom it will be perceived that it was
not without reason that jean valjeans passport described him as a very
from year to year this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal
sureness when the heart is dry the eye is dry on his departure from
the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear
what matters it the vessel does not halt the wind blows that sombre
ship has a path which it is forced to pursue it passes on
the man disappears then reappears he plunges he rises again to the
surface he calls he stretches out his arms he is not heard the
vessel trembling under the hurricane is wholly absorbed in its own
workings the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man
his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves he
gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths what a spectre is
that retreating sail he gazes and gazes at it frantically it retreats
it grows dim it diminishes in size he was there but just now he was
one of the crew he went and came along the deck with the rest he had
his part of breath and of sunlight he was a living man now what has
taken place he has slipped he has fallen all is at an end
he is in the tremendous sea under foot he has nothing but what flees
and crumbles the billows torn and lashed by the wind encompass him
hideously the tossings of the abyss bear him away all the tongues of
water dash over his head a populace of waves spits upon him confused
openings half devour him every time that he sinks he catches glimpses
of precipices filled with night frightful and unknown vegetations seize
him knot about his feet draw him to them he is conscious that he is
becoming an abyss that he forms part of the foam the waves toss him
from one to another he drinks in the bitterness the cowardly ocean
attacks him furiously to drown him the enormity plays with his agony
it seems as though all that water were hate
he tries to defend himself he tries to sustain himself he makes
an effort he swims he his petty strength all exhausted instantly
where then is the ship yonder barely visible in the pale shadows of
the wind blows in gusts all the foam overwhelms him he raises his eyes
and beholds only the lividness of the clouds he witnesses amid his
death pangs the immense madness of the sea he is tortured by this
madness he hears noises strange to man which seem to come from beyond
the limits of the earth and from one knows not what frightful region
there are birds in the clouds just as there are angels above human
distresses but what can they do for him they sing and fly and float
and he he rattles in the death agony
he feels himself buried in those two infinities the ocean and the sky
at one and the same time the one is a tomb the other is a shroud
night descends he has been swimming for hours his strength is
exhausted that ship that distant thing in which there were men has
vanished he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf he sinks he
stiffens himself he twists himself he feels under him the monstrous
there are no more men where is god
he shouts help help he still shouts on
he implores the expanse the waves the seaweed the reef they are
deaf he beseeches the tempest the imperturbable tempest obeys only the
around him darkness fog solitude the stormy and nonsentient tumult
the undefined curling of those wild waters in him horror and fatigue
beneath him the depths not a point of support he thinks of the gloomy
adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow the bottomless cold
paralyzes him his hands contract convulsively they close and grasp
nothingness winds clouds whirlwinds gusts useless stars what is
to be done the desperate man gives up he is weary he chooses the
alternative of death he resists not he lets himself go he abandons
his grip and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths
oh implacable march of human societies oh losses of men and of
souls on the way ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip
the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling
their condemned the sea is the immensity of wretchedness
the soul going down stream in this gulf may become a corpse who shall
when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when
jean valjean heard in his ear the strange words thou art free the
moment seemed improbable and unprecedented a ray of vivid light a ray
of the true light of the living suddenly penetrated within him but it
was not long before this ray paled jean valjean had been dazzled by
the idea of liberty he had believed in a new life he very speedily
perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is
