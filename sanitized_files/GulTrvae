pains wrung and extorted from you i cannot but conclude the bulk of your
natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that
nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth
the authors love of his country he makes a proposal of much advantage
to the king which is rejected the kings great ignorance in politics
the learning of that country very imperfect and confined the laws and
nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from
concealing this part of my story it was in vain to discover my
resentments which were always turned into ridicule and i was forced to
rest with patience while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously
treated i am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be
that such an occasion was given but this prince happened to be so
curious and inquisitive upon every particular that it could not consist
either with gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him what
satisfaction i was able yet thus much i may be allowed to say in my own
vindication that i artfully eluded many of his questions and gave to
every point a more favourable turn by many degrees than the strictness
of truth would allow for i have always borne that laudable partiality
to my own country which dionysius halicarnassensis with so much
justice recommends to an historian i would hide the frailties and
deformities of my political mother and place her virtues and beauties in
the most advantageous light this was my sincere endeavour in those many
discourses i had with that monarch although it unfortunately failed of
but great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly secluded
from the rest of the world and must therefore be altogether unacquainted
with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations the want
of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices and a certain
narrowness of thinking from which we and the politer countries of
europe are wholly exempted and it would be hard indeed if so remote a
princes notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for
to confirm what i have now said and further to show the miserable
effects of a confined education i shall here insert a passage which
will hardly obtain belief in hopes to ingratiate myself further into
his majestys favour i told him of an invention discovered between
three and four hundred years ago to make a certain powder into a heap
of which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in a
moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in
the air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder that
a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or
iron according to its bigness would drive a ball of iron or lead with
such violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force that
the largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks of
an army at once but batter the strongest walls to the ground sink down
ships with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and when
linked together by a chain would cut through masts and rigging divide
hundreds of bodies in the middle and lay all waste before them that we
often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron and discharged
them by an engine into some city we were besieging which would rip up
the pavements tear the houses to pieces burst and throw splinters on
every side dashing out the brains of all who came near that i knew the
ingredients very well which were cheap and common i understood the
manner of compounding them and could direct his workmen how to make
those tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in his
majestys kingdom and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long
twenty or thirty of which tubes charged with the proper quantity of
powder and balls would batter down the walls of the strongest town in
his dominions in a few hours or destroy the whole metropolis if ever it
should pretend to dispute his absolute commands this i humbly offered
to his majesty as a small tribute of acknowledgment in turn for so many
marks that i had received of his royal favour and protection
the king was struck with horror at the description i had given of those
terrible engines and the proposal i had made he was amazed how so
impotent and grovelling an insect as i these were his expressions
could entertain such inhuman ideas and in so familiar a manner as to
appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which i
had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines
whereof he said some evil genius enemy to mankind must have been
the first contriver as for himself he protested that although few
things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature yet
he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secret
which he commanded me as i valued any life never to mention any more
a strange effect of narrow principles and views that a prince possessed
of every quality which procures veneration love and esteem of strong
parts great wisdom and profound learning endowed with admirable
talents and almost adored by his subjects should from a nice
unnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception let
slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute
master of the lives the liberties and the fortunes of his people
neither do i say this with the least intention to detract from the many
virtues of that excellent king whose character i am sensible will on
this account be very much lessened in the opinion of an english reader
but i take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance by
not having hitherto reduced politics into a science as the more acute
wits of europe have done for i remember very well in a discourse one
day with the king when i happened to say there were several thousand
books among us written upon the art of government it gave him directly
contrary to my intention a very mean opinion of our understandings he
professed both to abominate and despise all mystery refinement and
intrigue either in a prince or a minister he could not tell what i
meant by secrets of state where an enemy or some rival nation were not
in the case he confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow
bounds to common sense and reason to justice and lenity to the speedy
determination of civil and criminal causes with some other obvious
topics which are not worth considering and he gave it for his opinion
that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to
grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve
better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the
the learning of this people is very defective consisting only in
morality history poetry and mathematics wherein they must be allowed
to excel but the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful
in life to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts so
that among us it would be little esteemed and as to ideas entities
abstractions and transcendentals i could never drive the least
no law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in
their alphabet which consists only of two and twenty but indeed few of
them extend even to that length they are expressed in the most plain
and simple terms wherein those people are not mercurial enough to
discover above one interpretation and to write a comment upon any law
is a capital crime as to the decision of civil causes or proceedings
against criminals their precedents are so few that they have little
reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either
they have had the art of printing as well as the chinese time out of
mind but their libraries are not very large for that of the king which
is reckoned the largest does not amount to above a thousand volumes
placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long whence i had liberty to
borrow what books i pleased the queens joiner had contrived in one of
glumdalclitchs rooms a kind of wooden machine five and twenty feet
high formed like a standing ladder the steps were each fifty feet long
it was indeed a moveable pair of stairs the lowest end placed at ten
feet distance from the wall of the chamber the book i had a mind to
read was put up leaning against the wall i first mounted to the upper
step of the ladder and turning my face towards the book began at the
top of the page and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten
paces according to the length of the lines till i had gotten a little
below the level of mine eyes and then descending gradually till i came
to the bottom after which i mounted again and began the other page in
the same manner and so turned over the leaf which i could easily do
with both my hands for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and in
the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long
their style is clear masculine and smooth but not florid for they
avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words or using various
expressions i have perused many of their books especially those in
history and morality among the rest i was much diverted with a little
old treatise which always lay in glumdalclitchs bed chamber and
belonged to her governess a grave elderly gentlewoman who dealt in
writings of morality and devotion the book treats of the weakness of
human kind and is in little esteem except among the women and the
vulgar however i was curious to see what an author of that country
could say upon such a subject this writer went through all the usual
topics of european moralists showing how diminutive contemptible and
helpless an animal was man in his own nature how unable to defend
himself from inclemencies of the air or the fury of wild beasts how
much he was excelled by one creature in strength by another in speed by
a third in foresight by a fourth in industry he added that nature
was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world and could
now produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancient
times he said it was very reasonable to think not only that the
species of men were originally much larger but also that there must have
been giants in former ages which as it is asserted by history and
tradition so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually
dug up in several parts of the kingdom far exceeding the common dwindled
race of men in our days he argued that the very laws of nature
absolutely required we should have been made in the beginning of a size
more large and robust not so liable to destruction from every little
accident of a tile falling from a house or a stone cast from the hand
of a boy or being drowned in a little brook from this way of
reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the
conduct of life but needless here to repeat for my own part i could
not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread of drawing
lectures in morality or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining
from the quarrels we raise with nature and i believe upon a strict
inquiry those quarrels might be shown as ill grounded among us as they
as to their military affairs they boast that the kings army consists of
a hundred and seventy six thousand foot and thirty two thousand horse
if that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in the
several cities and farmers in the country whose commanders are only the
nobility and gentry without pay or reward they are indeed perfect
enough in their exercises and under very good discipline wherein i saw
no great merit for how should it be otherwise where every farmer is
under the command of his own landlord and every citizen under that of
the principal men in his own city chosen after the manner of venice by
i have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in a
great field near the city of twenty miles square they were in all not
above twenty five thousand foot and six thousand horse but it was
impossible for me to compute their number considering the space of
ground they took up a cavalier mounted on a large steed might be
about ninety feet high i have seen this whole body of horse upon a
word of command draw their swords at once and brandish them in the air
imagination can figure nothing so grand so surprising and so
astonishing it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were
darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky
i was curious to know how this prince to whose dominions there is no
access from any other country came to think of armies or to teach his
people the practice of military discipline but i was soon informed
both by conversation and reading their histories for in the course of
many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which the
whole race of mankind is subject the nobility often contending for
power the people for liberty and the king for absolute dominion all
which however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom have been
sometimes violated by each of the three parties and have more than once
occasioned civil wars the last whereof was happily put an end to by this
princes grand father in a general composition and the militia then
settled with common consent has been ever since kept in the strictest
the king and queen make a progress to the frontiers the author attends
them the manner in which he leaves the country very particularly
i had always a strong impulse that i should some time recover my liberty
though it was impossible to conjecture by what means or to form any
project with the least hope of succeeding the ship in which i sailed
was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and the
king had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared it
should be taken ashore and with all its crew and passengers brought in a
tumbril to lorbrulgrud he was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own
size by whom i might propagate the breed but i think i should rather
have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept
in cages like tame canary birds and perhaps in time sold about the
kingdom to persons of quality for curiosities i was indeed treated
with much kindness i was the favourite of a great king and queen and
the delight of the whole court but it was upon such a foot as ill became
the dignity of humankind i could never forget those domestic pledges i
had left behind me i wanted to be among people with whom i could
converse upon even terms and walk about the streets and fields without
being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy but my
deliverance came sooner than i expected and in a manner not very common
the whole story and circumstances of which i shall faithfully relate
i had now been two years in this country and about the beginning of the
third glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen in a progress to
the south coast of the kingdom i was carried as usual in my
travelling box which as i have already described was a very convenient
closet of twelve feet wide and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed by
silken ropes from the four corners at the top to break the jolts when a
servant carried me before him on horseback as i sometimes desired and
would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road on the
roof of my closet not directly over the middle of the hammock i ordered
the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square to give me air in hot
weather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drew
when we came to our journeys end the king thought proper to pass a few
days at a palace he has near flanflasnic a city within eighteen english
miles of the seaside glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued i had
gotten a small cold but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to
her chamber i longed to see the ocean which must be the only scene of
my escape if ever it should happen i pretended to be worse than i
really was and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with a
page whom i was very fond of and who had sometimes been trusted with
me i shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitch
consented nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me
bursting at the same time into a flood of tears as if she had some
forboding of what was to happen the boy took me out in my box about
half an hours walk from the palace towards the rocks on the sea shore
i ordered him to set me down and lifting up one of my sashes cast many
a wistful melancholy look towards the sea i found myself not very well
and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which i
hoped would do me good i got in and the boy shut the window close
down to keep out the cold i soon fell asleep and all i can conjecture
is while i slept the page thinking no danger could happen went among
the rocks to look for birds eggs having before observed him from my
window searching about and picking up one or two in the clefts be that
as it will i found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the
ring which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of
carriage i felt my box raised very high in the air and then borne
forward with prodigious speed the first jolt had like to have shaken me
out of my hammock but afterward the motion was easy enough i called
out several times as loud as i could raise my voice but all to no
purpose i looked towards my windows and could see nothing but the
clouds and sky i heard a noise just over my head like the clapping of
wings and then began to perceive the woful condition i was in that some
eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak with an intent to let it
fall on a rock like a tortoise in a shell and then pick out my body
and devour it for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to
discover his quarry at a great distance though better concealed than i
in a little time i observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase
very fast and my box was tossed up and down like a sign in a windy day
i heard several bangs or buffets as i thought given to the eagle for
such i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his
beak and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly
down for above a minute but with such incredible swiftness that i
almost lost my breath my fall was stopped by a terrible squash that
sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of niagara after which i
was quite in the dark for another minute and then my box began to rise
so high that i could see light from the tops of the windows i now
perceived i was fallen into the sea my box by the weight of my body
the goods that were in and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength
at the four corners of the top and bottom floated about five feet deep
in water i did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew away
with my box was pursued by two or three others and forced to let me
drop while he defended himself against the rest who hoped to share in
the prey the plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box for
those were the strongest preserved the balance while it fell and
hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water every joint of
it was well grooved and the door did not move on hinges but up and down
like a sash which kept my closet so tight that very little water came
in i got with much difficulty out of my hammock having first ventured
to draw back the slip board on the roof already mentioned contrived on
purpose to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifled
how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom
one single hour had so far divided me and i may say with truth that in
the midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear lamenting my poor
nurse the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasure of the
queen and the ruin of her fortune perhaps many travellers have not
been under greater difficulties and distress than i was at this juncture
expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces or at least
overset by the first violent blast or rising wave a breach in one
single pane of glass would have been immediate death nor could any thing
have preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed on the
outside against accidents in travelling i saw the water ooze in at
several crannies although the leaks were not considerable and i
endeavoured to stop them as well as i could i was not able to lift up
the roof of my closet which otherwise i certainly should have done and
sat on the top of it where i might at least preserve myself some hours
longer than by being shut up as i may call it in the hold or if i
escaped these dangers for a day or two what could i expect but a
miserable death of cold and hunger i was four hours under these
circumstances expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my last
i have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed
upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant
who used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckle
it about his waist being in this disconsolate state i heard or at
least thought i heard some kind of grating noise on that side of my box
where the staples were fixed and soon after i began to fancy that the
box was pulled or towed along the sea for i now and then felt a sort of
tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows leaving
me almost in the dark this gave me some faint hopes of relief although
i was not able to imagine how it could be brought about i ventured to
unscrew one of my chairs which were always fastened to the floor and
having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly under the
slipping board that i had lately opened i mounted on the chair and
putting my mouth as near as i could to the hole i called for help in a
loud voice and in all the languages i understood i then fastened my
handkerchief to a stick i usually carried and thrusting it up the hole
waved it several times in the air that if any boat or ship were near
the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box
i found no effect from all i could do but plainly perceived my closet to
be moved along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the
box where the staples were and had no windows struck against something
that was hard i apprehended it to be a rock and found myself tossed
more than ever i plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet
like that of a cable and the grating of it as it passed through the
ring i then found myself hoisted up by degrees at least three feet
higher than i was before whereupon i again thrust up my stick and
handkerchief calling for help till i was almost hoarse in return to
which i heard a great shout repeated three times giving me such
transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them
i now heard a trampling over my head and somebody calling through the
hole with a loud voice in the english tongue if there be any body
below let them speak i answered i was an englishman drawn by ill
fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent and
begged by all that was moving to be delivered out of the dungeon i was
in the voice replied i was safe for my box was fastened to their
ship and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the
cover large enough to pull me out i answered that was needless and
would take up too much time for there was no more to be done but let
one of the crew put his finger into the ring and take the box out of the
sea into the ship and so into the captains cabin some of them upon
hearing me talk so wildly thought i was mad others laughed for indeed
it never came into my head that i was now got among people of my own
stature and strength the carpenter came and in a few minutes sawed a
passage about four feet square then let down a small ladder upon which
i mounted and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition
the sailors were all in amazement and asked me a thousand questions
which i had no inclination to answer i was equally confounded at the
sight of so many pigmies for such i took them to be after having so
long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects i had left but the
captain mr thomas wilcocks an honest worthy shropshire man observing
i was ready to faint took me into his cabin gave me a cordial to
comfort me and made me turn in upon his own bed advising me to take a
little rest of which i had great need before i went to sleep i gave
him to understand that i had some valuable furniture in my box too good
to be lost a fine hammock a handsome field bed two chairs a table
and a cabinet that my closet was hung on all sides or rather quilted
with silk and cotton that if he would let one of the crew bring my
closet into his cabin i would open it there before him and show him my
goods the captain hearing me utter these absurdities concluded i was
raving however i suppose to pacify me he promised to give order as i
desired and going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closet
whence as i afterwards found they drew up all my goods and stripped
off the quilting but the chairs cabinet and bedstead being screwed to
the floor were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen who tore
them up by force then they knocked off some of the boards for the use
of the ship and when they had got all they had a mind for let the hull
drop into the sea which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom
and sides sunk to rights and indeed i was glad not to have been a
spectator of the havoc they made because i am confident it would have
sensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my mind which i
i slept some hours but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place i
had left and the dangers i had escaped however upon waking i found
myself much recovered it was now about eight oclock at night and the
captain ordered supper immediately thinking i had already fasted too
long he entertained me with great kindness observing me not to look
wildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left alone desired i
would give him a relation of my travels and by what accident i came to
be set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest he said that about
twelve oclock at noon as he was looking through his glass he spied it
at a distance and thought it was a sail which he had a mind to make
being not much out of his course in hopes of buying some biscuit his
own beginning to fall short that upon coming nearer and finding his
error he sent out his long boat to discover what it was that his men
came back in a fright swearing they had seen a swimming house that he
laughed at their folly and went himself in the boat ordering his men to
take a strong cable along with them that the weather being calm he
rowed round me several times observed my windows and wire lattices that
defended them that he discovered two staples upon one side which was
all of boards without any passage for light he then commanded his men
to row up to that side and fastening a cable to one of the staples
ordered them to tow my chest as they called it toward the ship when
it was there he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring
fixed in the cover and to raise up my chest with pulleys which all the
sailors were not able to do above two or three feet he said they saw
my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and concluded that some
unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity i asked whether he or the
crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air about the time he first
discovered me to which he answered that discoursing this matter with
the sailors while i was asleep one of them said he had observed three
eagles flying towards the north but remarked nothing of their being
larger than the usual size which i suppose must be imputed to the great
height they were at and he could not guess the reason of my question i
then asked the captain how far he reckoned we might be from land he
said by the best computation he could make we were at least a hundred
leagues i assured him that he must be mistaken by almost half for i
had not left the country whence i came above two hours before i dropped
into the sea whereupon he began again to think that my brain was
disturbed of which he gave me a hint and advised me to go to bed in a
cabin he had provided i assured him i was well refreshed with his
good entertainment and company and as much in my senses as ever i was in
my life he then grew serious and desired to ask me freely whether i
were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime
for which i was punished at the command of some prince by exposing me
in that chest as great criminals in other countries have been forced
to sea in a leaky vessel without provisions for although he should be
sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship yet he would engage his
word to set me safe ashore in the first port where we arrived he
added that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd
speeches i had delivered at first to his sailors and afterwards to
himself in relation to my closet or chest as well as by my odd looks
i begged his patience to hear me tell my story which i faithfully did
from the last time i left england to the moment he first discovered me
and as truth always forces its way into rational minds so this honest
worthy gentleman who had some tincture of learning and very good sense
was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity but further to
confirm all i had said i entreated him to give order that my cabinet
should be brought of which i had the key in my pocket for he had
already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet i opened it in
his own presence and showed him the small collection of rarities i made
in the country from which i had been so strangely delivered there was
the comb i had contrived out of the stumps of the kings beard and
another of the same materials but fixed into a paring of her majestys
thumb nail which served for the back there was a collection of needles
and pins from a foot to half a yard long four wasp stings like
joiners tacks some combings of the queens hair a gold ring which one
day she made me a present of in a most obliging manner taking it from
her little finger and throwing it over my head like a collar i desired
the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his
civilities which he absolutely refused i showed him a corn that i had
cut off with my own hand from a maid of honours toe it was about the
bigness of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when i returned
england i got it hollowed into a cup and set in silver lastly i
desired him to see the breeches i had then on which were made of a
i could force nothing on him but a footmans tooth which i observed him
to examine with great curiosity and found he had a fancy for it he
received it with abundance of thanks more than such a trifle could
deserve it was drawn by an unskilful surgeon in a mistake from one of
glumdalclitchs men who was afflicted with the tooth ache but it was as
sound as any in his head i got it cleaned and put it into my cabinet
it was about a foot long and four inches in diameter
the captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had given
him and said he hoped when we returned to england i would oblige the
world by putting it on paper and making it public my answer was
that we were overstocked with books of travels that nothing could now
pass which was not extraordinary wherein i doubted some authors less
consulted truth than their own vanity or interest or the diversion of
ignorant readers that my story could contain little beside common
events without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants trees
birds and other animals or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of
savage people with which most writers abound however i thanked him
for his good opinion and promised to take the matter into my thoughts
he said he wondered at one thing very much which was to hear me speak
so loud asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick
of hearing i told him it was what i had been used to for above two
years past and that i admired as much at the voices of him and his men
who seemed to me only to whisper and yet i could hear them well enough
but when i spoke in that country it was like a man talking in the
streets to another looking out from the top of a steeple unless when i
was placed on a table or held in any persons hand i told him i had
likewise observed another thing that when i first got into the ship
and the sailors stood all about me i thought they were the most little
contemptible creatures i had ever beheld for indeed while i was in
that princes country i could never endure to look in a glass after
mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects because the
comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself the captain said
that while we were at supper he observed me to look at every thing with
a sort of wonder and that i often seemed hardly able to contain my
laughter which he knew not well how to take but imputed it to some
disorder in my brain i answered it was very true and i wondered how
i could forbear when i saw his dishes of the size of a silver
three pence a leg of pork hardly a mouthful a cup not so big as a
nut shell and so i went on describing the rest of his household stuff
and provisions after the same manner for although he queen had
ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me while i was in
her service yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what i saw on every
side of me and i winked at my own littleness as people do at their own
faults the captain understood my raillery very well and merrily
replied with the old english proverb that he doubted mine eyes were
bigger than my belly for he did not observe my stomach so good although
i had fasted all day and continuing in his mirth protested he would
have gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen my closet in the eagles
bill and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea
which would certainly have been a most astonishing object worthy to have
the description of it transmitted to future ages and the comparison of
phaton was so obvious that he could not forbear applying it although i
the captain having been at tonquin was in his return to england driven
north eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees and longitude of 143 but
meeting a trade wind two days after i came on board him we sailed
southward a long time and coasting new holland kept our course
west south west and then south south west till we doubled the cape of
good hope our voyage was very prosperous but i shall not trouble the
reader with a journal of it the captain called in at one or two ports
and sent in his long boat for provisions and fresh water but i never
went out of the ship till we came into the downs which was on the third
day of june 1706 about nine months after my escape i offered to leave
my goods in security for payment of my freight but the captain protested
he would not receive one farthing we took a kind leave of each other
and i made him promise he would come to see me at my house in redriff i
hired a horse and guide for five shillings which i borrowed of the
as i was on the road observing the littleness of the houses the trees
the cattle and the people i began to think myself in lilliput i was
afraid of trampling on every traveller i met and often called aloud to
have them stand out of the way so that i had like to have gotten one or
when i came to my own house for which i was forced to inquire one of
the servants opening the door i bent down to go in like a goose under
a gate for fear of striking my head my wife run out to embrace me
but i stooped lower than her knees thinking she could otherwise never be
able to reach my mouth my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing but i
could not see her till she arose having been so long used to stand with
my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet and then i went to take her
up with one hand by the waist i looked down upon the servants and one
or two friends who were in the house as if they had been pigmies and i a
giant i told my wife she had been too thrifty for i found she had
starved herself and her daughter to nothing in short i behaved myself
so unaccountably that they were all of the captains opinion when he
first saw me and concluded i had lost my wits this i mention as an
instance of the great power of habit and prejudice
in a little time i and my family and friends came to a right
understanding but my wife protested i should never go to sea any more
although my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder me
as the reader may know hereafter in the mean time i here conclude the
part iii a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and
the author sets out on his third voyage is taken by pirates the
malice of a dutchman his arrival at an island he is received into
i had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson a
cornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundred
tons came to my house i had formerly been surgeon of another ship
where he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levant
he had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer
and hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out of
friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long
absences but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find i
me in good health asking whether i were now settled for life adding
that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months at last he
plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the
ship that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two mates
that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having
experienced my knowledge in sea affairs to be at least equal to his he
would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i had
he said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest a
man that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeing
the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as
ever the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose
consent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she
we set out the 5th day of august 1706 and arrived at fort st george
the 11th of april 1707 we staid there three weeks to refresh our crew
many of whom were sick from thence we went to tonquin where the
captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he
intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in
several months therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he
must be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods
wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands and
putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he
appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he
we had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we were
driven five days to the north north east and then to the east after
which we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from the
west upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon
overtook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slow
neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves
we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered
furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our
faces for so i gave order they pinioned us with strong ropes and
setting guard upon us went to search the sloop
i observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authority
though he was not commander of either ship he knew us by our
countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language
swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea i spoken
dutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him in
consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring
countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take
some pity on us this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings
and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese
language as i suppose often using the word christianos
the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain
who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly he came up to me and
after several questions which i answered in great humility he said we
should not die i made the captain a very low bow and then turning to
the dutchman said i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in
a brother christian but i had soon reason to repent those foolish
words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain to
persuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea which
they would not yield to after the promise made me that i should not
die however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me
worse in all human appearance than death itself my men were sent by
an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned
as to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a small
canoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which last
the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and
would permit no man to search me i got down into the canoe while the
dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and
about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation and
found we were in the latitude of 46 n and longitude of 183 when i was
at some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocket glass
several islands to the south east i set up my sail the wind being
fair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made a
shift to do in about three hours it was all rocky however i got many
birds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry sea weed
by which i roasted my eggs i ate no other supper being resolved to
spare my provisions as much as i could i passed the night under the
shelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty well
the next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third and
fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles but not to
trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let it
suffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sight
which lay south south east to the former
this island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did not
reach it in less than five hours i encompassed it almost round before
i could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creek
about three times the wideness of my canoe i found the island to be all
rocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweet smelling
herbs i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself
i secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers i
gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dry
sea weed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day and
roast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel
match and burning glass i lay all night in the cave where i had lodged
my provisions my bed was the same dry grass and sea weed which i
intended for fuel i slept very little for the disquiets of my mind
prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake i considered how
impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and how
miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding
that i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enough
to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced i walked awhile among
the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i was
forced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscure
as i thought in a manner very different from what happens by the
interposition of a cloud i turned back and perceived a vast opaque
body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed
to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but i
did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than
if i had stood under the shade of a mountain as it approached nearer
over the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance the
bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the
sea below i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore
and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at less
than an english mile distance i took out my pocket perspective and
could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of
it which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i was
the natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i was
ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or other
help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in but
at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to
behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as it
should seem to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they
pleased but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise
upon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the island
would take because it seemed for awhile to stand still yet soon after
it advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed with
several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to
descend from one to the other in the lowest gallery i beheld some
people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on i waved my
cap for my hat was long since worn out and my handkerchief toward the
island and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with the
utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld a
crowd gather to that side which was most in my view i found by their
pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me
although they made no return to my shouting but i could see four or
five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island
who then disappeared i happened rightly to conjecture that these were
sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion
the number of people increased and in less than half all hour the
island was moved and raised in such a manner that the lowest gallery
appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the
height where i stood i then put myself in the most supplicating
posture and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer those
who stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinction
as i supposed by their habit they conferred earnestly with each other
looking often upon me at length one of them called out in a clear
polite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and therefore
i returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadence
might be more agreeable to his ears although neither of us understood
the other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw the
they made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the
shore which i accordingly did and the flying island being raised to a
convenient height the verge directly over me a chain was let down from
the lowest gallery with a seat fastened to the bottom to which i fixed
the humours and dispositions of the laputians described an account of
their learning of the king and his court the authors reception
there the inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes an account of
at my alighting i was surrounded with a crowd of people but those who
stood nearest seemed to be of better quality they beheld me with all
the marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was i much in their
debt having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their
shapes habits and countenances their heads were all reclined either
to the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the other
directly up to the zenith their outward garments were adorned with the
figures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddles
flutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many other
instruments of music unknown to us in europe i observed here and
there many in the habit of servants with a blown bladder fastened like
a flail to the end of a stick which they carried in their hands in
each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas or little pebbles as i
was afterwards informed with these bladders they now and then flapped
the mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice i
could not then conceive the meaning it seems the minds of these people
are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speak
nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by some
external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reason
those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper the
original is climenole in their family as one of their domestics nor
ever walk abroad or make visits without him and the business of this
officer is when two three or more persons are in company gently to
strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right
ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself this flapper
is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks and
upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes because he is always
so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of falling
down every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and in
the streets of justling others or being justled himself into the
it was necessary to give the reader this information without which he
would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these
people as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island and
from thence to the royal palace while we were ascending they forgot
several times what they were about and left me to myself till their
memories were again roused by their flappers for they appeared
altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance and
by the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were more
at last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber of
presence where i saw the king seated on his throne attended on each
side by persons of prime quality before the throne was a large table
filled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of all
kinds his majesty took not the least notice of us although our
entrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of all
persons belonging to the court but he was then deep in a problem and
we attended at least an hour before he could solve it there stood by
him on each side a young page with flaps in their hands and when they
saw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the other
his right ear at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden and
looking towards me and the company i was in recollected the occasion of
our coming whereof he had been informed before he spoke some words
whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side and
flapped me gently on the right ear but i made signs as well as i could
that i had no occasion for such an instrument which as i afterwards
found gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of my
understanding the king as far as i could conjecture asked me several
questions and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i had
when it was found i could neither understand nor be understood i was
conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace this prince being
distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to
strangers where two servants were appointed to attend me my dinner
was brought and four persons of quality whom i remembered to have seen
very near the kings person did me the honour to dine with me we had
two courses of three dishes each in the first course there was a
shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle a piece of beef into
a rhomboides and a pudding into a cycloid the second course was two
ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resembling
flutes and hautboys and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp the
servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several
while we were at dinner i made bold to ask the names of several things
in their language and those noble persons by the assistance of their
flappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration of
their great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them i was
soon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else i wanted
after dinner my company withdrew and a person was sent to me by the
kings order attended by a flapper he brought with him pen ink and
paper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that he
was sent to teach me the language we sat together four hours in which
time i wrote down a great number of words in columns with the
translations over against them i likewise made a shift to learn several
short sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch
something to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walk
and the like then i took down the sentence in writing he showed me
also in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars the
zodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominations
of many plains and solids he gave me the names and descriptions of all
the musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on each
of them after he had left me i placed all my words with their
interpretations in alphabetical order and thus in a few days by the
help of a very faithful memory i got some insight into their language
the word which i interpret the flying or floating island is in the
original laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymology
lap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh a
governor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa from
lapuntuh but i do not approve of this derivation which seems to be a
little strained i ventured to offer to the learned among them a
conjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lap
signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outed
a wing which however i shall not obtrude but submit to the judicious
those to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill i was clad
ordered a tailor to come next morning and take measure for a suit of
clothes this operator did his office after a different manner from
those of his trade in europe he first took my altitude by a quadrant
and then with a rule and compasses described the dimensions and
outlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in six
days brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape by
happening to mistake a figure in the calculation but my comfort was
that i observed such accidents very frequent and little regarded
during my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition that
held me some days longer i much enlarged my dictionary and when i went
next to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and to
return him some kind of answers his majesty had given orders that the
island should move north east and by east to the vertical point over
lagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth
it was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days and
a half i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made
in the air by the island on the second morning about eleven oclock
the king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers and
officers having prepared all their musical instruments played on them
for three hours without intermission so that i was quite stunned with
the noise neither could i possibly guess the meaning till my tutor
informed me he said that the people of their island had their ears
adapted to hear the music of the spheres which always played at certain
periods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever
in our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered that
the island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence he
might receive the petitions of his subjects and to this purpose
several packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom on
these packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted up
directly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of
the string that holds their kite sometimes we received wine and
victuals from below which were drawn up by pulleys
the knowledge i had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring
their phraseology which depended much upon that science and music and
in the latter i was not unskilled their ideas are perpetually
conversant in lines and figures if they would for example praise the
beauty of a woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombs
circles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or by
words of art drawn from music needless here to repeat i observed in
the kings kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments
after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his
their houses are very ill built the walls bevil without one right angle
in any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to
practical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic those
instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their
workmen which occasions perpetual mistakes and although they are
dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rule
the pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behaviour of
life i have not seen a more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so
slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects except
those of mathematics and music they are very bad reasoners and
vehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of the
right opinion which is seldom their case imagination fancy and
invention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in their
language by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass of
their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned
most of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical part
have great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own
it publicly but what i chiefly admired and thought altogether
unaccountable was the strong disposition i observed in them towards news
and politics perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving their
judgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of a
party opinion i have indeed observed the same disposition among most of
the mathematicians i have known in europe although i could never
discover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those people
suppose that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the
largest therefore the regulation and management of the world require no
more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe but i rather
take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature
inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have
least concern and for which we are least adapted by study or nature
these people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minutes
peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very
little affect the rest of mortals their apprehensions arise from
several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that
the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in
course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun
will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more
light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the
tail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes
and that the next which they have calculated for one and thirty years
hence will probably destroy us for if in its perihelion it should
approach within a certain degree of the sun as by their calculations
they have reason to dread it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand
times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence
from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen
