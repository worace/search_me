why for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men of
his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too
energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
terrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the
recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late a
fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at yukhnovna
hanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because i
alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him
yes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i did
not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who
had stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have been very
glad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my father that again is for
prince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishly
while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was no
there now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is a
very good thing but not for you i dont suppose you ever had anyone
flogged or sent to siberia and still less for your serfs if they are
beaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they are any the
worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes on
their bodies heal and they are happy as before but it is a good thing
for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselves
stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able to
inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity and
for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs you may not have
seen but i have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of
unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and
harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more
prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking
that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his fathers
so thats what im sorry for human dignity peace of mind purity and
not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may
no no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said
in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now and
then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper
pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in
pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and
he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not
see the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten and
raise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that
prince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching
and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
no but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering his head
and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so you
think what about asked prince andrew with surprise
about life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thought like
that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont smile
freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it was
freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of
and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince
andrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed
from the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhood
only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is
a dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outside this
union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you that
nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his
life like you merely trying not to harm others but make our
fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up
to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as i
have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
prince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to
pierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels prevented
his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the
peculiar glow that came into prince andrews eyes and by his silence
pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew would
not interrupt him or laugh at what he said
they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
cross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on it
prince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at
the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun
well what do you think about it pierre asked why are you silent
what do i think about it i am listening to you its all very well
you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life the
destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who are we
men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what you see
you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dont see it
do you believe in a future life he asked
a future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no time
to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knew
you say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor could
i and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of
everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to the
fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universe
in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are now
the children of earth are eternally children of the whole universe
dont i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast harmonious whole
dont i feel that i form one link one step between the lower and
higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the
deity the supreme power if you prefer the term is manifest if i see
clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why should i suppose
it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther i feel that i
cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that i shall
always exist and always have existed i feel that beyond me and above me
there are spirits and that in this world there is truth
yes that is herders theory said prince andrew but it is not that
which can convince me dear friend life and death are what convince
what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with ones
own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right
prince andrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly that
being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist why it
cannot be that there is no answer and i believe there is thats
what convinces that is what has convinced me said prince andrew
yes yes of course said pierre isnt that what im saying
no all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with
someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and
you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have looked
well thats it then you know that there is a there and there is a
someone there is the future life the someone is god
prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since been
taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun had sunk half
below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the
ferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmen
coachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked
if there is a god and future life there is truth and good and mans
highest happiness consists in striving to attain them we must live we
must love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap
of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the whole
said pierre and he pointed to the sky
prince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierre
became silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
current beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the sound
of the waves kept up a refrain to pierres words whispering
he sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at
pierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superior
yes if it only were so said prince andrew however it is time to
get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the sky
to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since austerlitz saw
that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield
and something that had long been slumbering something that was best
within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul it
vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life
but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop
existed within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in prince
andrews life though outwardly he continued to live in the same old
it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the house
prince andrew with a smile drew pierres attention to a commotion going
on at the back porch a woman bent with age with a wallet on her back
and a short long haired young man in a black garment had rushed back
to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up two women ran out after
them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay up the
those are marys gods folk said prince andrew they have mistaken
us for my father this is the one matter in which she disobeys him he
orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them
prince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to meet them
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute
prince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always kept
in perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house he himself
let us go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returned i
have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her gods
folk it will serve her right she will be confused but you will see
princess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
when they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the icon
stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monks
cassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in an
armchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on
andrew why didnt you warn me said the princess with mild reproach
as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens
charmee de vous voir je suis tres contente de vous voir  she said
to pierre as he kissed her hand she had known him as a child and now
his friendship with andrew his misfortune with his wife and above all
his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him she looked at
him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say i like you very
much but please dont laugh at my people after exchanging the first
 delighted to see you i am very glad to see you
ah and ivanushka is here too said prince andrew glancing with a
andrew said princess mary imploringly il faut que vous sachiez que
cest une femme  said prince andrew to pierre
andrew au nom de dieu 2 princess mary repeated
 you must know that this is a woman
it was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the pilgrims
and princess marys helpless attempts to protect them were their
mais ma bonne amie said prince andrew vous devriez au contraire
mtre reconnaissante de ce que jexplique a pierre votre intimit avec
 but my dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for
explaining to pierre your intimacy with this young man
really said pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
seriousness for which princess mary was specially grateful to him into
ivanushkas face who seeing that she was being spoken about looked
princess marys embarrassment on her peoples account was quite
unnecessary they were not in the least abashed the old woman lowering
her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup
upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat quietly
in her armchair though hoping to be offered another cup of tea
ivanushka sipping out of her saucer looked with sly womanish eyes from
where have you been to kiev prince andrew asked the old woman
i have good sir she answered garrulously just at christmastime i
was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the
shrine of the saint and now im from kolyazin master where a great
i go by myself benefactor said ivanushka trying to speak in a bass
voice i only came across pelageya in yukhnovo
pelageya interrupted her companion she evidently wished to tell what
in kolyazin master a wonderful blessing has been revealed
what is it some new relics asked prince andrew
andrew do leave off said princess mary dont tell him pelageya
no why not my dear why shouldnt i i like him he is kind he is
one of gods chosen hes a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles i
remember when i was in kiev crazy cyril says to me hes one of gods
own and goes barefoot summer and winter he says why are you not
going to the right place go to kolyazin where a wonder working icon of
the holy mother of god has been revealed on hearing those words i said
good by to the holy folk and went
all were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones
so i come master and the people say to me a great blessing has been
revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed mother the
all right all right you can tell us afterwards said princess mary
let me ask her said pierre did you see it yourselves he inquired
oh yes master i was found worthy such a brightness on the face like
the light of heaven and from the blessed mothers cheek it drops and
but dear me that must be a fraud said pierre naively who had
oh master what are you saying exclaimed the horrified pelageya
lord jesus christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself oh
dont speak so master there was a general who did not believe and
said the monks cheat and as soon as hed said it he went blind and
he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the kiev catacombs came to him
and said believe in me and i will make you whole so he begged take
me to her take me to her its the real truth im telling you i saw
it myself so he was brought quite blind straight to her and he goes
up to her and falls down and says make me whole says he and ill
give thee what the tsar bestowed on me i saw it myself master the
star is fixed into the icon well and what do you think he received
his sight its a sin to speak so god will punish you she said
how did the star get into the icon pierre asked
and was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said prince
pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands
oh master master what a sin and you who have a son she began her
pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red master what have you said god
forgive you and she crossed herself lord forgive him my dear what
does it mean she asked turning to princess mary she got up and
almost crying began to arrange her wallet she evidently felt
frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such
things could be said and was at the same time sorry to have now to
now why need you do it said princess mary why did you come to
come pelageya i was joking said pierre princesse ma parole je
nai pas voulu loffenser  i did not mean anything i was only
joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense it
was all my fault and andrew was only joking
 princess on my word i did not wish to offend her
pelageya stopped doubtfully but in pierres face there was such a look
of sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at her and
now at pierre that she was gradually reassured
the pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave a
long account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that his
hands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monks
she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking
some dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with the
saints id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to another
id sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics and there was
such peace all around such blessedness that one dont want to come
out even into the light of heaven again
pierre listened to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went out
of the room and then leaving gods folk to finish their tea
princess mary took pierre into the drawing room
you are very kind she said to him
oh i really did not mean to hurt her feelings i understand them so
well and have the greatest respect for them
princess mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately
i have known you a long time you see and am as fond of you as of a
brother she said how do you find andrew she added hurriedly not
giving him time to reply to her affectionate words i am very anxious
about him his health was better in the winter but last spring his
wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure and i
am also very much afraid for him spiritually he has not a character
like us women who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows he keeps
it all within him today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that is
the effect of your visit he is not often like that if you could
persuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quiet regular
life is very bad for him others dont notice it but i see it
toward ten oclock the men servants rushed to the front door hearing
the bells of the old princes carriage approaching prince andrew and
whos that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out of the
ah very glad kiss me he said having learned who the young stranger
the old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre
before supper prince andrew coming back to his fathers study found
him disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars the old prince disputed it
drain the blood from mens veins and put in water instead then there
will be no more war old womens nonsense old womens nonsense he
repeated but still he patted pierre affectionately on the shoulder and
then went up to the table where prince andrew evidently not wishing to
join in the conversation was looking over the papers his father had
brought from town the old prince went up to him and began to talk
the marshal a count rostov hasnt sent half his contingent he came
to town and wanted to invite me to dinner i gave him a pretty
dinner and there look at this well my boy the old prince
went on addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder a fine
fellow your friend i like him he stirs me up another says clever
things and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks rubbish yet
stirs an old fellow up well go get along perhaps ill come and sit
with you at supper well have another dispute make friends with my
little fool princess mary he shouted after pierre through the door
only now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize the
strength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm was
not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
and with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timid
princess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once felt
like an old friend they were all fond of him already not only princess
mary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him her
most radiant looks but even the one year old prince nicholas as his
grandfather called him smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in his
arms and michael ivanovich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at him
with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince
the old prince came in to supper this was evidently on pierres
account and during the two days of the young mans visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again
when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together they
began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
acquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything but
when returning from his leave rostov felt for the first time how
close was the bond that united him to denisov and the whole regiment
on approaching it rostov felt as he had done when approaching his home
in moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of
his regiment when he recognized red haired dementyev and saw the picket
ropes of the roan horses when lavrushka gleefully shouted to his
master the count has come and denisov who had been asleep on his
bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and the
officers collected round to greet the new arrival rostov experienced
the same feeling as when his mother his father and his sister had
embraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak
the regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and precious as
when he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
been reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had gone
out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests of
the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
narrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace of
moral support and the same sense of being at home here in his own
place as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of all
that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his right
place and took mistaken decisions here was no sonya with whom he ought
or ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of going
there or not going there here there were not twenty four hours in the
day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not that
innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther
from him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefined
money relations with his father and nothing to recall that terrible
loss to dolokhov here in the regiment all was clear and simple the
whole world was divided into two unequal parts one our pavlograd
regiment the other all the rest and the rest was no concern of his
in the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant who
captain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who was
a comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit ones pay came every four
months there was nothing to think out or decide you had only to do
nothing that was considered bad in the pavlograd regiment and when
given an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitely
having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
life rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
rest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter
for him because after his loss to dolokhov for which in spite of all
his familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself he
had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving not as he had
done before but really well and by being a perfectly first rate
comrade and officer in a word a splendid man altogether a thing which
seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regiment
after his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
in five years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
our army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultusk
and preussisch eylau was concentrated near bartenstein it was awaiting
the emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaign
the pavlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which had
served in the 1805 campaign had been recruiting up to strength in
russia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
campaign it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussisch eylau and
when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign
platovs division was acting independently of the main army several
times parts of the pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the
enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal oudinots
carriages in april the pavlograds were stationed immovably for some
weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village
a thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke
and the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for the men
nor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports could
arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages
searching for potatoes but found few even of these
everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled if any
remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking
anything from them often gave them the last of their rations
the pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but had
lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitals
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swelling
that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able to
drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals when
spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they called
mashkas sweet root it was very bitter but they wandered about the
fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it though
they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant that spring a
new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legs
and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite
of all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fed chiefly on mashkas
sweet root because it was the second week that the last of the
biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the
the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
roofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of
despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just
as usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the
hussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed their
horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they
rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as
usual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before
them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes told
and listened to stories of potemkins and suvorovs campaigns or to
legends of alesha the sly or the priests laborer mikolka
the officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless half
ruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and in
general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves as
before some playing cards there was plenty of money though there was
no food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittles
the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because
nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague
feeling that in the main it was going badly
rostov lived as before with denisov and since their furlough they had
become more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovs family
but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostov felt that
the elder hussars luckless love for natasha played a part in
strengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to expose rostov
to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safe
return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in a
deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
provisions rostov found a family consisting of an old pole and his
daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weak
to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rostov
brought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and kept
them for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of his
comrades talking of women began chaffing rostov saying that he was
more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
introduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rostov took the
joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to the
officer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a duel when the
officer had gone away denisov who did not himself know what rostovs
relations with the polish girl might be began to upbraid him for his
say what you like she is like a sister to me and i cant tell you
how it offended me because well for that reason
denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
without looking at rostov as was his way at moments of deep feeling
ah what a mad bweed you wostovs are he muttered and rostov noticed
in april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperors arrival but
rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at
bartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hut
dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the
hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a
trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep
and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and
these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room
in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board
lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on
each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof
was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table
denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron
liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece
of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very cold
embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron
on the steps in the reception room as denisov called that part of the
hut and it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were
always some with denisov and rostov sat in their shirt sleeves
in april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven and
eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed
his rain soaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm
then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his
face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was
pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who
had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk
suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut
evidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he was
i ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuff denisov was
shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom
i have given the order again and again your honor but they dont
rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fuss
and bustle now my jobs done and im lying down capitally he could
hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of denisovs was talking
as well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about
loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for
then denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away
where are they off to now thought rostov
five minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots
on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his
leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to
rostovs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly
let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going
out and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the
mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone having
got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till
toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared
up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka
laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the
soft mud rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officers
saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses
behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket
ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them
there now denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are the
so they are said the officers wont the soldiers be glad
a little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantry
i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently
havent i told you i wont give them up replied denisov
you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport of
ones own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days
and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov
it is robbery youll answer for it sir said the infantry officer
now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his
temper i shall answer for it and not you and youd better not buzz
about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers
very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding
away if you are determined to rob ill
go to the devil quick mach while youre safe and sound and denisov
very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning
his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle
a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov
after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing
ive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all
the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was
unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the
soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared
the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his
this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and wont
begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle
the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a
receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was
booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair
from the regimental commanders denisov rode straight to the staff with
a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to
his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisov
could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was the
matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse
alarmed at denisovs condition rostov suggested that he should undress
drink some water and send for the doctor
twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but ill
always thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewo ice he
the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to
bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm
and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him
i get there began denisov now then wheres your chiefs
quarters they were pointed out please to wait ive widden twenty
miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me
vewy well so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to
lecture me its wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who
seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to
fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he
says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will
be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at
the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it thats
starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his
newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the
tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so its you whos
starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat
stwaight on his snout ah what a what a and i stated
fwashing him well ive had a bit of fun i can tell you cried
denisov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showing under his black
mustache id have killed him if they hadnt taken him away
but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov youve set
your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again
denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and
but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostovs and
denisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in
which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence the adjutant
told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a
court martial had been appointed and that in view of the severity with
which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to
the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for
the case as represented by the offended parties was that after
seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief
quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened
to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them
in answer to rostovs renewed questions denisov said laughing that he
thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but
that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear
any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he
would give them an answer that they would not easily forget
denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him
too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he
feared a court martial and was worried over the affair which was
evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to
hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the
staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack
regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode
out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a
french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at
another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did
not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who
felt his friends absence very much having no news of him since he left
and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov
the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated
by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so
beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly
dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets
tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about
the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale
swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army
doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant
i cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar
alexeevich in the evening i shall be there
oh do the best you can isnt it all the same the doctor noticed
what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets
having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir
typhus sir its death to go in only we two makeev and i he
pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have
died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week
said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been
invited here but our allies dont like it at all
rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who
i dont know i cant tell you sir only think i am alone in charge
of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients its well that
the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some
lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir
and theyre always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh
the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient
major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten
dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of
the assistant however did not confirm the doctors words
is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor
there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one is
dead i fancy however ill look up our list we had a list have you
makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if youll
step into the officers wards youll see for yourself he added
ah youd better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to
but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to
only dont blame me the doctor shouted up after him
rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so
strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his
strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an
emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped
out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious
eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw that
the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats
what is there to see said the assistant
but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in
rostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had already
begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a
little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it
in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows
the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and
leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid
no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised
themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at
rostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy
of anothers health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking
through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing
there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all
expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs
outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that
only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were
still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of
his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
repeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drink drink
a drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put this
man back in his place and bring him water
